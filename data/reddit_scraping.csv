2,heysharkdontdothat,0,t3_bmmo7x,3,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bmmo7x/this_is_the_story_of_the_worst_coworker_to_ever/,"Hey everyone. For anyone who had a rough night dealing with the church crowd last night or just need a good story in general, I’d like to tell you all the story of the worst coworker ever. DISCLAIMER: Some details may reveal where I work. If you notice them please don’t say anything. Also on mobile. 

About one year ago, right around the holidays, this girl (let’s call her Debbie) got hired at my restaurant. Now Debbie had just turned 18 a week ago, and was very excited for her first job. Debbie STILL LIVED AT HOME AND DIDNT PAY BILLS (This is important later.) 

Let me start out by saying that Debbie was not nice. Debbie got three people fired in the 6 months she worked with us by calling corporate and making complaints like her life depended on it. 

Debbie liked to be right. If you said something to Debbie that Debbie did not agree with then she would go to the manager immediately. If the manager did not agree , Debbie would call corporate for “creating a hostile work environment” and “discrimination.” As you can imagine, this made Debbie not fun to work with.

Debbie also had a bit of a complex. For someone who had just started her first job, she acted like she had invented the idea of restaurants. Debbie would speak to guests like a manager, and would go to OTHER servers tables if they had a problem and pretend to be a manager. Debbie liked to get on the grill to “help” and tell the grill line how to do their job. Debbie would also try to help host if it got busy, and this would result in double and triple seating because she didn’t know how to work the POS system. If customers ever complained on Debbie, she would immediately burst into tears.

After about 3 months, Debbie found out she was sick. She had a tumor on her brain that she would need removed. If the surgery went okay, she’d be out of work for a month. Now, as we all know this surgery seems very expensive. 

My company offers a program to help employees in need, who’ve had emergencies or will have to be off work for a while. A certain amount is taken out of every paycheck and put towards a charity fund. If someone should have an emergency they can apply to be gifted by the fund for help. So every single server, cook, host, dishwasher, and manager donates to this fund every single week. 

Debbie applies for the fund. She gets rewarded a few thousand to help pay for the surgery expenses. You’d think this would good enough for Debbie, but it wasn’t. Debbie gets mad that the fund didn’t give her more. 

December was a bad month for my store. A single mom of two had her house burned down. She applied for the fund, and was happy with what she got. Another coworker had her daughter killed in a hit and run accident. She was happy with what the fund gave her. Neither one of them complained and thanked all of us for our contributions to the charity. 

Debbie decides that the money rewarded to her wasn’t enough and gets on our store Facebook page and posts her Go Fund Me account. Debbie explains in her post that she needs a few more thousand dollars, because she’ll be out of work for the month and needs help paying her bills. As previously stated, Debbie still lived at home. When someone asked Debbie what bills she had , she said she needs money for her phone bill. 

Debbie never said thank you for the money she got from the charity. Instead, Debbie gets mad that we don’t donate to her Go Fund Me and posts on her personal Facebook that we’re a bunch of greedy, dumb bitches. 

After her surgery and recovery Debbie comes back full force and ready for revenge. Calls to corporate increase, shifts get worse. People start calling out on days she has to work. And then the fateful night comes: Debbie slips on a menu. Debbie sues the company for money because she states that it causes trauma to her recent surgery. The company reviews the camera and sees that it was Debbie herself who had dropped the menu. 

Debbie quit out of shame two weeks later. 

And thus ends the tale of the worst coworker to ever exist.",0,This is the story of the worst coworker to ever exist,63
3,RookiePuck,0,t3_bmj1ss,17,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bmj1ss/guy_tried_to_take_back_his_tip/,"Sorry this got long. So I work as a bar manager/bartender in a relatively towny bar where I went to college. We have bands playing almost every weekend and we get some weirdos from time to time just like everyone else. 


There’s this semi-regular who I’ll call Douche because he is one who came in a few Saturdays ago with his wife. Douche has never been my favorite person. He’s annoying, he racks up huge tabs, and NEVER tips. 


He got pretty tipsy over the course of a few hours and was paying in cash all night even though he normally paid with a card. Every time he opened his wallet I could see a huge wad of cash in there, but he didn’t tip after any of his drinks. Oh well, been there done that. Chalk it up as a loss. 


I had gone to the bathroom briefly and when I got back I notice Douche shoving some cash over the bar. There was cash EVERYWHERE near him. It was all over the bar in front of him where people normally put their tips, it was over the drink mat, the ice bin, the rail with bottles in it, and the floor. 


I quickly walked over and began picking up all of his cash and tried to hand it back to him when his wife stopped me. 


Wife: “He said that money is for you. It’s his money and he can do what he wants with it and he says it’s for you.”


Okay...weird. But I do as I’m told and I take the money. I don’t put it in my tip jar though. I leave it off to the side in full view of both of them in case he comes back and sees his money is gone and it wasn’t actually a tip for me. 


(Side note: his wife is completely sober. She’d only been drinking soda)


Douche ends up getting a few more drinks, his wife leaves, neither of them bring up the large tip ($116 to be exact just for a reference point). When he leaves I take the tip and put it in the tip jar to split with my other bartender at the end of the night. 


The next day I get a phone call from the bartender currently working who had no idea what happened last night and he says “Douche’s wife called and asked if we still had the money he asked for us to keep behind the bar for him last night. She said it was $60.”


Oh hell no. The wife left her phone number and I told all of my bartenders that if she called again to let her know my schedule and that she could come in and talk to me in person if she wanted that money back. First of all, it was his money. Second of all, SHE was the one who told me to keep it. Thirdly, that wasn’t even close to the correct amount so what was going on?


She clearly told me it was a tip from him. I don’t know what happened and if they were fighting or not, but neither of them asked for it back the night of where I would’ve handed it back to them with little more than an eye roll. You can’t just decide you actually didn’t want to tip the day after. 


My shift on Tuesday rolls around and I didn’t actually think they were going to come in and ask for it because who wants that kind of confrontation? But alas, Douche walks in and I take him out the the hallway and ask him what he wants.  He immediately starts stammering. 


Douche: “uhhhh....ummm...I think I left my debit card here this weekend.”


Me:”You paid in cash and we didn’t find one when we cleaned at night.”


Douche: “uhhh...yeah. Okay. Thanks.”


But he didn’t leave. He just stood in front of me ringing his hands. 


Me: “Is that all you came for? Your wife called.” (I wasn’t going to make it easier on him to ask for his money back. If he wanted it back so badly he needed to vocalize it.)


Douche: “ummm...yeah. We just were looking for my debit card.” 


Then he walked off without asking for his money back. He hasn’t been back since. Had he asked for it back I would have given it to him and asked him to never return to our bar. It would’ve been a small price to pay to get rid of him once and for all. I know it’s a little petty and I could’ve just handed it over, but it’s not my fault that they regretted that tip in the morning. There’s a lot of people who regret their bar tabs in the morning, but we don’t give them their money back on that so why should I with a tip? I just needed to vent a bit.

I’m a server at a German beer haus, but went on a date night at an upscale restaurant in my city. 

There was an 8top next to us that seemed like they were at a business dinner. Now, when I go out to a restaurant, I try to treat the server like a friend rather than someone waiting on me because I know everyone needs that once in a while. Well the asshat at the 8top is talking at the waiter, not too him like a normal human being. This man tells his waiter his food should be “thrown to the dogs”, as if the waiter made it for him. I get not liking your food, I do, but you don’t need to be such a prick when asked about it. Who the hell does that help? 

I thought that interaction was bad but what really put me over the edge was him waving obnoxiously at our waiter when he was helping other tables because “he didn’t want his friend drinking by herself”. So obviously instead of waiting 30 seconds for the waiter to pass by he needed to cause a scene. There was a ton of other snarky shit he did throughout the night that compounded my anger to the point I felt like venting it here. 

I’m honestly just so disgusted that people think treating any server like shit is okay. Our waiter was kind and attentive all night. I tipped $50 on our $157 bill in hopes that it would make his night better and if I could’ve afforded to tip more I would’ve.

I’ve been itching out of my skin to go back to work, and I had my very first table of two polite gentlemen having a work lunch. At the end as the guy who paid was signing the receipt, he said, “Let me ask you a question. What’s going on in your life that you could use an extra tip for?” I told him it was my first day back and that my recovery had been tough but was finally looking up, and that I was excited to be off worker’s comp benefits finally. The guys asked me some questions about my life and school, then thanked me and left.

7,behind-these-eyes,0,t3_bm3ge9,189,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bm3ge9/almost_walked_out_tonight/,"Hey guys, it's rant time. Sorry for the length. 90% of the scenarios I'm about to list just happened in the last five hours, but they're also a daily thing.



I've had it with teenagers who come in little smug groups and tip nothing.

I've had it with old folks who come in and give me attitude and tip nothing.

I've had it with huge families and their misbehaving brats who come in and demand special treatment just because they contributed to overpopulation, then tip 5% on a $100+ bill.

I've had it with men who come in and demand to know my ethnicity and ask to touch my hair or make comments about my body, and only tip me based on my looks.

I've had it with drunk people who are full of hot air and ready to make a mess of my restaurant and my mood, and only tip if they don't forget.

I've absolutely fucking had it with anyone who waltzes in and thinks servers aren't human beings. Just who exactly do they think they are?! I'm often the only server on the floor, it's late at night, and just because I'm young and have multiple ear piercings does not mean you get to use me as a fucking door mat. I still know how to do my job better than you do. I don't care that you were a waitress back when dinosaurs roamed the land, ma'am. 

Just tonight I had people tell me I look tired, ask if I have kids, ask if I'm pregnant, ask if I have a boyfriend, ask ask ask ask. Why not ask me how my day's been? Or how I'm doing? 

Haha, never mind. Just come on in and tell me I could be sued because I served the milkshake in a different cup. Come in and have a fit because we are out of an item. Come in and lose your shit on your underpaid waitress just because you had a bad day.

How about coworkers. What happened to playing with the TEAM? What happened to staying for 10 extra minutes to help someone who just came in and already has 4 tables of 5+ people? No? Okay. How about just finishing your fucking jobs so I don't have to clean up after you? Also no? Awesome.

To be clear, I am professional and polite. I'm making myself sound like some aggressive server here. I actually enjoy taking the high road. That's why I'm in here venting out all the shit I can't say aloud. 

I need a new job. I know people will always be shitty, but maybe I can find a place where coworkers cooperate, where I can make better money, and not have to have two stiff drinks after work to make the adrenaline wear off.

8,mydogcharl1e,0,t3_bmk0ig,2,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bmk0ig/simultaneously_considerate_and_aggravating/,"*Disclaimer: I was another customer in this interaction

Last night I got hungry for a gyro for dinner and headed to my favorite local Greek place. I was cutting it close to my personal cut-off time getting there about 30 minutes to close. I always get carry-out and usually am in/out in 10 minutes at this place unless they were already in the weeds.

I’m waiting for my order and group of 3, 2 women and 1 man, comes in, looking like they probably just came from a co-ed softball game. 

W1: I didn’t realize you close at 9 (it’s ~8:45 now), is it ok if we order to-go?

C: Sure, can I get a name?

W1: *talking to the other 2* We’ll find somewhere else to eat, cool?

C: Name for the order?

W1: You sure it’s ok?

C: I just need a name to start the order...

I’m pretty sure this was my first uncontrollable chuckle and head shake.  I can hear the cashier’s internal voice screaming ‘Give me your dog’s name for all I care but I need a name to start an order!’

They finally get their orders spit out and after ringing them up the dude chimes in with this gem

M: How annoying would it be if we ate here?

C: ....

M: Be honest

C: I think if you’re asking the question you already know the answer

I’m fighting full on laughter at this point just amazed at how they were somehow both considerate/understanding of the fact they were about to close but also aggravating with taking forever to get their order in and the ridiculous question.  Like how do you not realize the position you’re putting this guy in asking that? You can say it’s cool to be honest but if he actually does answer honestly now you’ve got review fodder that could absolutely get him fired.  

It gave me flashbacks to my high school years and working in the kitchen of a similar kind of place but I wasn’t surprised by the way the cashier handled it, dude is really good at his job.

He took off another $35 brings it down to around $60. Then they tell him to shove the key lime pie. They sat at the table an extra 30 minutes after they signed the bill.

11,PegaVincent,0,t3_bmfxnl,1,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bmfxnl/well_heres_something_i_never_thought_id_see/,"I was originally thinking about posting this in r/ChoosingBeggars, but after asking around on Discord, discovered that this story would be better suited for this subreddit.

For context, it's around 4PM, and there aren't that many other people working in the store. I'm the only one at the register, and am the only one having to hand out orders. Only one person making sandwiches for both drive-thru and front register. One person running drive-thru, taking orders, getting their money, and handing out those orders. One on grill. And nobody on fries, meaning everyone has to make and drop fries and nuggets so nobody runs out.

I take this couple's order, and it totals out to about $15. I let them know I'll call them up as soon as we have it ready, as per usual working in this particular chain. There's a few orders in front of them, and I'm doing what I can to get orders out as fast as possible. But, with the low employee count at the moment, it's not easy. I get to the order before theirs, and I'm waiting a little bit on fries (about 30-45 seconds). I go to put the sandwiches on the tray, and soon all hell breaks loose.

The lady approaches me and starts complaining about how this is the worst service they've ever had, and my anxiety begins kicking in, my brain yelling at me 'DO WHAT THEY ASK AND THEY'LL BE HAPPY'. They demanded that I rush the order before theirs so they'd get their order right away, and I do so with the fries that just came out for that order. I immediately start getting their order together, and she now starts demanding that they be given a refund for their order, as well as actually getting their order. I lost count of how many times they also badmouthed my manager while she was trying to get them their refund. I really should have stopped making their food, but as I said before, anxiety was in full swing at the moment. Once I got their food to them, I ducked out to the back of the store to hide myself from them and to chill the frig out. A couple of minutes pass and I finally go back up front, where they grab their food, which I put in to-go bags, and they go and sit down. Mind you, they were complaining about the wait time, so I thought they wanted it to go, and they made it seem like they were in a damn hurry. So this was a punch to the gut if I ever saw one. Thankfully, it did end on a good note, as another lady who saw all this happen come up to me and told me that I actually did nothing wrong, and those customers are just one of those kinds of people who want to get free food by pulling this kind of crud.

Edit: (spoiler alert i didn’t do very good at doing that) 

we all know how this goes. taking a 10 top while you already have a few tables. the host asked me if i wanted to take it, and my tables seemed about ready to wrap up, so yeah, let’s give it another go. 

suddenly the other tables want/need more attention/service. i’ve got a 4 top waiting for food that’s in the red (aka they’ve been waiting way too long. everything has been ready for about 15 minutes except for one dish that i can only assume has been cooked or prepared incorrectly at least twice?) 

it’s one of those nights where a lot of tables want to order drinks, apps, and entrees all at once. and that’s a cycle that feeds itself right? (the longer you take at one table, the longer the new table has to wait before being greeted: the longer they have to look at the menu and figure out what they want before you get there) 

the regional GM is in town and she’s been (i don’t want to say “micromanaging”... more like ironing out a lot of kinks?) she actually sat in my section during my morning shift and did her computer work while i took tables within earshot, which of course made me extra anxious and more prone to choking up. 

we’re a corporate chain, and my location usually gets best or second best scores amongst the other 30 or so restaurants across the country. and i’ll be honest i’m not the greatest server we have, but nonetheless here i am, representing the best of the best. 

the pressure got to me big time. i did my best to hit all our required steps of service (including mandatory suggestive selling, naming our fucking brewer to every fucking table, putting a rewards cards in front of their faces and convincing them to sign up, saying the name of a dessert no matter how full they’ve already said they are, etc and so forth) (also, even the hosts are required to suggestively sell as they’re seating tables) and long story short, i had to have a sit down at the end of that shift with our beloved RGM, chef, and the GM to receive a few lessons on service. 
not gonna lie though she taught me a really cool and simple trick that helps remove some anxiety from interactions with guests, which i started implementing on the second shift. but my performance anxiety obv stayed with me through the second shift 

anyway back to the story right? we’re talking about the second shift. 
so now you kind of get the basics of the restaurant’s dynamic here... anyway the RGM is still on property after night fall. 
luckily she’s been outside talking with chef and this other corporate dude who was super weird and ambiguous about his presence there. GM is running expo, and it’s busy. i usually get the angry eyes and the “what do you want now? i’m busy” tone when i try talk to her while we’re busy, especially if it takes more than 4 seconds to do so. 

i’m trying to ring shit in and brew decaf and regular coffee, but only one can be brewed at once. birthday boy at table 35 wants an irish coffee, but i already started brewing the decaf before i realized somebody emptied the caffeinated without starting a new pot, so birthday boy is already waiting for his irish, and the decafs are still waiting. meanwhile the table who had to wait super long for their food has a complaint. the dish that took the extra 15 minutes was cold in the middle. i don’t understand how because it was the last fucking dish that was made. the freshest of them all. 
i bring it back to expo, refill drinks around the tables and go to put in more rounds of drinks, as i’m putting them in the computer, i hear, “u/Aquestrophe, i need a follow, your food’s running.” 

this is for the 10 top with 8 burgers, all dressed and undressed differently with non-conforming accessories included. part of me wants to scream “WAIT. LET ME MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS RIGHT BEFORE IT RUNS”
but i’m so scared of my gm yelling at me, i just hesitate through the 2 second chance i had to say something. so i go back to putting in the orders. two trays have already been run to the table, i’m grabbing the third tray and just hoping there’s no hiccups. 

i get there, almost half of the burgers have been set in front of people, do you think even more than one of these people realize that 80% of the people at the table had burgers? i just keep seeing it replay in my mind over and over again. 
“who had the burger?” 
*3 people raise their hand* 
the other 5 burger people aren’t paying attention
“oh okay well here’s one of the burgers, and one for you, and one for you (:”
obv it didn’t go down exactly like that, but by the time i leave the table i’m getting bacon for two people, taking away a salad that i find out “was pretty dry,” grabbing more dressing for another salad. and oh yeah they just didn’t make the one burger that was supposed to be meat and bun only. and im coming back to expo with some weird burger with specifications that i never rang in. 

i assume it’s over for me. i already know it’s gonna be 10 separate checks and i’m getting 2 stiffs, three 10%s, a 5%, two 18%s, a 20% and a 23%. (at least that’s my average for big tops with individual checks who feel their service wasn’t good enough no matter the circumstances.) 

at the end of the day, the tips were pretty good all around. pretty much consistently 20% from everybody at the 10 top. i’d made some jokes, still treated them like family, used some of that good ol southern hospitality. 
oh yeah and got 12 reward card signups today... which is kind of a big deal around here. 
i work here one day a week and i’m gonna have more signups for the week than 85% of these full time servers. 

so now the RGM can honestly look at my GM and say “okay well i guess you’re actually not out here running a circus” all thanks to me (:

15,Maddyherselius,0,t3_bm9lfl,12,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bm9lfl/mothers_day_brunch/,"The restaurant I work at is a sort of upscale Italian restaurant, we don’t open for lunch on weekends normally but we’re open from morning to night on Mother’s Day. It’s the busiest day of the year for us, and we have tons of specials that we don’t get normally. 

We don’t serve any breakfast food at my work, but we did add a Quiche entree on special for lunch that day. Other than that, we had fried calamari, seafood lasagna, other entrees that have nothing to do with breakfast. 

Well last night as I was working I answer the phone. It’s a guy asking about our Mother’s Day hours. Then he asks me about our brunch. I told him we would have Quiche, but that’s about it. He whined “Well the ad I saw in the paper said BRUNCH, now how much is BRUNCH per person?” I’m confused. Per person? We don’t have a buffet or anything like it, so I had no idea what he was talking about. 

Me: Per person? The Quiche dish is $15.95 and comes with- 

Him: I’m not talking about the damn Quiche. How much is brunch per person? Just your regular brunch? 

Me: We don’t have any other brunch options.. 

Him: oh my god BRUNCH. Like a buffet or something? I’m not paying $15.95 per meal. 

I finally asked to put him on hold for my manager, as it’s clear he’s not listening to me lol.  He yells at my manager for a few minutes, and my manager explains that we do not have brunch or any kind of buffet. The guy yells “HANG ON” and grabbed his newspaper where he saw our ad. After about a minute of silence he comes back to the phone and apologizes, the ad was for a completely different restaurant across town. 

He ends the phone call with “Well, you guys won’t make any money without serving brunch. I wouldn’t wanna eat there anyway.” And hung up.

We have a small kitchen and a lot of seating (it’s annoying)  so sometimes tickets do take awhile but I always get ahead of it and tell them right as they sit down in case they have somewhere to be. 

So I tell them it will be awhile for food but apps/drinks will be quick and they are fine with it. Everything is fine with them and I have 12 other tables and we are slammed so I am extremely busy. After about 15 minutes the man beckons me over and I am confused because their drinks are full/apps haven’t been touched. The man says, “I need to take my wife to the hospital immediately.”

I am genuinely concerned for this woman but I don’t ask any questions because he didn’t offer any context. I tell them to not worry about the drinks and to just head out and we will take care of it, and hope that she is okay. 
The man responds and says “we still want our food, but to go.” 

I’m confused at this point but rush to inform my manager and the kitchen. Their ticket was still quite a few back so they rushed the order and I packed it up for them. At this point we are so packed and on a wait so although I was concerned, I really did not have time for this and it sent me very deep in the weeds. 

I rush back with the check and the food and set it down for them. I stand there expecting him to immediately put down the card. But he just looks at me and asks for some more tea. I thought it was strange but I walk (honestly, run) away to do other things, and get the tea. Paying them out is in the forefront of my mind.

They came in about 8pm, didn't have a booking but we'd just had a few tables leave so we thought ""hey! We'll squeeze them in!"" I'm so happy we did.

Actually for the last 3 days or so I have been having some asthma issues. Today was the first day it was really getting to me at work. The inhaler I have is old and empty because it hasn’t really been an issue for years, but lots of allergies this season for me.

Anyways, it was the last table of the night for me since I was just breaking the bartender and then heading home afterwards. It was a party of 6. 

Our restaurant is one of those places where you can put peanut shells on the floor and one of these people “didn’t want peanuts to get in his socks” (through his high top shoes somehow) and didnt ask me to sweep as he just stood there for a second expectantly. So I’m not going to lie I didn’t have the happiest face on while I started sweeping the area and was really struggling to breathe. Just 10 minutes before this I was in the bathroom yakking trying to catch my breath. 

The man who I assume was the dad said “do you have a problem with us?” as I was sweeping. I explained that I didn’t, I sweep peanuts everyday this is no big deal but I am just having some real issues with my asthma right now” But again I’ll be honest, I know I looked annoyed with the world while I was doing this. When I did explain my asthma issue though, the daughter started laughing pretty hard. And I looked at her and said kind of loudly “pretty funny huh?” The dad then said “excuse me” as the daughter was still kind of like shocked smiling and I said “oh nothing she just thinks what I said was hilarious” 

They proceeded to get my GM’s contact info from my on duty manager and left the restaurant. But on their way out the mom had said to me “she’s 14!”. All I said back was “ok” because I realized that I shouldn’t say anything more but all I was thinking was “that’s 14 years to teach your child not to laugh at other people’s health issues”

26,everywherewitch,0,t3_bm7kge,14,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bm7kge/the_weirdest_table_ive_ever_had_a_good_and_a_bad/,"So this was a couple months ago, it was the last table of the night. Looked like an old couple their daughter and her husband. The old man was wearing a very interesting hat and had a fancy cane.  As soon as I walk up to introduce myself I know this table is going to be odd. Ya know, when people only kinda talk to you, but always has those same jokes we hear like 5 times a night. Everyone was really nice to me but the old guy was kinda crabby. He orders a pork chop for dinner but orders it rare, I inform him it is against the law to serve pork at temperature and we cook it till it's done, but that I would have the kitchen cook it as little as they can by law so that he is safe. He seems to have no problem with this, and I work closely with the kitchen to make sure the pork-chop isn't overcooked. 

The second I drop the food off at the table he starts complaining. Saying he doesn't understand that law and that he orders his pork rare all the time and never has a problem. He starts name dropping fancy restaurants in the area and just will not stop complaining. All before he even tries the food. I walk away to compose myself and let the kitchen know there will probably be a problem and head back to the table. 

Just as I expected he hates the pork-chop, it's dry and overcooked and he refuses to eat it. He keeps saying pork can't make you sick and that we are all idiots for overcooking it. EVEN THO WE DIDN'T. We cooked it less than usual and everyone else who comes in loves the pork-chop, its my favorite meal. 

I don't argue I just take the plate away. He refuses to get anything else and just sits there looking pissed off while the rest of the table enjoys their food. No one else at the table says a word to me, and I avoid going back as to not make this man any more upset. He asks for the check pays in card, but I see there is a few twenties on the table, I ignore the cash and clean up all the plates. As I am walking away arms full the old man calls me over, I tell him I'll be right back because honestly I have no more patience for this man. 

He points to the cash on the table and says that it's mine. Hesitantly I grab it, and its $80, over 50% of the bill. Naturally I refuse this tip, because he was obviously upset and didn't have a good time, and although he was awful I honestly felt bad. He insists and I look at everyone else at the table and they just give me a little smile and a nod. On the way out the man says ""you outta see what I give for good service"", laughing. 

That tip allowed me to make great money on a otherwise super rough day, but it was really hard to not be upset by it at the same time.

The bartender wasn't busy at all so he made my drinks in less than 5 minutes. I put their food order in, it comes out in like 15 minutes. I ask them if they need anything else, and they are super polite, say the food looks great, thank me, etc.

I go to fold silverware and check on them a few minutes later and they are ready for their check. I bring it to them and tell them to have a great rest of their night and they leave.

I go show my manager and explain what happened and she's also confused.

I had a table come in tonight, older, retired Marine in his 70s (based on his lanyard and hat) and his daughter (in her 50s). The daughter orders both meals and lets me know the gentleman prefers his steak RARE, very RARE, almost cold, basically just sear it. If it's not, he'll send it back and she apologizes. I literally wrote RAW on my server pad :) so I would remember the stress. After I took the order and put it in, I warned my manager that this table would likely be sending their food back just so he could be aware of the potential issue. He rolled his eyes and told me exactly what I already knew, we legally have to serve your meat at a reasonable temp. If he wants a ""raw"" steak, he'll have to do it at home. I mentally prepared myself for the oncoming argument when their food went out.

Their food comes up and as I carry it out I know the steak I'm serving is not to his standards but I pray to the Gods that it works anyway.

Midway through the meal he asked for ice cream for dessert and told me that last time the server brought him the bottle of chocolate syrup to put on himself.

I've worked Bar for quite a long time. It got me through college and, for the most part, I really enjoyed it. 

At college I was learning to take care of kids, and everything that goes along with it. When this story takes place, I had been trying to  perfect 'The Stare' 

You know the one. Some of the people on my work placement had this down. They could freeze a kid at twenty paces with just a look. It was awe inspiring. I was trying, but my 'stare' just didn't seem to have the same power. I was definitely missing something. 


But one day, after months of practice, I finally nailed it. Not in the school, but from behind my bar. 

It was a Friday, a very busy night, we were short staffed, only two of us on the bar, and everyone was just a bit frantic. 

I'm serving as fast as I physically can. Trying to keep tabs on the order my customers have arrived, so I can be as fair as possible. 

After all, I spent my days saying things like 'we must all take turns' it's hard to turn that off. I'd spent a full day with primary 1. I was tired, stressed, and rediculously busy. 

I'm trying to focus on the order I'm making, when I hear one voice that cuts through everything. 

I presume someone asked him what he was going to get. But I didn't hear that part. I just heard him, voice as clear as glass, cutting across the hubub. 

""Just a pint, if this bitch ever serves me."" 

It's not the worst I've heard, not even close. But for some reason, at that moment, those words stirred something inside me. Something in the depths of my soul. Something dark and malevolent, that I didn't even know I possessed. 

I turned to him, half poured drink in my hand, I met his gaze, and for the first time in my life, I counjoured up 'The Stare'

I could feel the power of it course through me. 

The reaction was instantaneous, the giant burly man transformed, before my eyes, into a cowering little boy.

He apologised profusely. I acknowledged his apology with nothing more than a small head nod, then went back to serving my original customer. 

I still served him. When it was his turn, of course. I'm not totally heartless. 

He appolgised again, and even tipped me a fiver.

I have never in my life, and probably never will again, feel as powerful as I did in that moment.

I'm sure he learned his lesson, and I learned how to harness the power of 'The Stare'

I'm the newest and youngest (lol, I'm nearly 40) waitress with the least experience (a measly 15 years).. so that's what I'm walking in to. My diner has been a popular neighborhood place for decades, and the majority of the waitresses have been there just as long. I have zero issues with anyone.. and then there's Jane, which isn't her name but it's damn near close enough.



At first everyone told me to just ignore her, so I did. She was a bit snippy about my other job, making cracks about how I'm stealing her job, so she's going to steal mine. Annoying but whatever. I mostly worked in the other dining room so our contact was limited. I quit my other job, picked up more hours at the diner, and they gave me one of her days. And then gave me most of her closing shifts.. so she's now cut earlier, when it used to be me leaving early.



Management isnt stupid, they know she is sick aand they ARE cutting her days and hours, but holy shit, I get the best of her abuse. I mostly ignore her or just say ""please don't start"" ..but I am at my breaking point here. 


So here are some of Jane's antics!


- she randomly throws giant, screaming hissy fits in the dining room, about how everyone is stealing her money and wants her to be homeless. 


- accuses everyone of poisoning her food/drinks. I had only heard stories up until the other day when she questioned why I had a bottle of Tabasco near where I had taken a break and eaten at the counter. I told her I was using it. She asked if I put it in her coffee, and made a huge show of pouring her coffee out and smiling like she had outsmarted me. WTF.


- she will take HOURS doing her sidework after she's cut. If the manager tells her to just leave it/clocks her out.. huge fit.


- the thing that bothers me the most? She accuses me of sleeping with the managers/owners/cooks/everyone. I had always been cordial to her up until we were closing together one day and she smiled at me and asked if I was going to leave my husband for the owner or the manager and it's ok if I want both. It's only escalated since that incident.


She is NOT a bad server, she's been at it a million years and although she can be a bit 'gruff' and snippy, her muscle memory at her actual job is good. Just, she goes off the damn wall sometimes and honestly, is a huge liability. Management obviously is aware, they were going to give another of her days to another new waitress who ended up quitting.. but I think they're just willing to deal with it. The owners don't see the worst of it, it mainly happens at night after they've left. And she's been there for 20 years so I think they feel they owe her something. Or are afraid of a lawsuit..


My husband was in to eat the other day, and I stepped out for a smoke. When I came back in, he called me over and told me Jane had some screaming fit in the middle of the dining room and now he understands everything I've said about her. He was thinking it wasn't so bad.


The other waitresses, women who have been her friend for decades, can't stand her. She thinks we are all against her, want her to lose her job, want her to die, etc. Even regulars who have been coming for years have seen her decline.. One guy the other day screamed ""What the fuck is wrong with you!?"" at her.. when she wouldn't stop badgering him to move from my table to the counter so she could serve him coffee. 



I started a log of all the shit she says and does, but this is a family diner so no corporate AND I'm planning on moving in a couple of months, so I don't want to ruin anyone's livelihood when I won't even be around soon. I think I just needed to vent. It's rough. Maybe if anyone has tips to deal with someone who has a mental illness/honestly looks like schizophrenia?

Anyway, I had a couple years of food service experience under my belt before I made the switch to retail while I was in school to become an Aesthetician. Sometime during that year of school and said retail job, my existing anxiety got much worse and I developed one HELL of a case of social anxiety. A busy sales floor crowded with needy, irritable customers, a loud and claustrophobic atmosphere, and the ever-looming stress of high customer service standards and even higher sales goals were just a recipe for disaster. I’m not exaggerating, it got to a point where I was taking up to 4-5 Crying Breaks in a shift. So, as a mental health move, I quit the retail job. Right now, however, I still only work part-time as an Aesthetician at a medical office. It’s much better from an anxiety standpoint, as I only work with patients one-on-one and by appointment.


Here’s where serving comes in: to make ends meet, I’ve picked up another restaurant job - this time in an upscale cocktail bar. I’m just a food runner now, but even so, the anxiety is definitely still there in ways I don’t remember it ever having been when I used to wait tables in the past. Management wants to start training me to be a server, and I really could use the extra cash, but I’m truly frightened that I won’t be able to handle it like past me could. I really was a very good server back then - my tips averaged in the mid-upper 20%’s and the restaurant even had some positive reviews mention me by name. Now, the fear of failure and the sense of personal inadequacy are suffocating, and I sometimes find myself angry and bitter towards customers who didn’t even DO anything. They deserve better. 


I guess my question is - are there any of y’all out there who suffer from high anxiety but have learned to tame it when you’re working? I need to know your secrets! Or even just your stories. If there’s anyone else like me who’s actually managing to do well in this industry, I think it would make me feel a lot less stupid.",0,"Who here has got MAD social anxiety, and how do you cope?",0
35,onepunchmane96,0,t3_bmb4tu,2,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bmb4tu/despite_the_ups_and_downs_what_ive_gained_as_an/,"I started working food service at your typical big chain pizza delivery place, in BOH. Soon after, I got hired at a little mom and pop restaurant that also served breakfast, lattes, desserts, etc. It was counter service, so I wasn’t a full server yet, and not making the kind of money servers can make in my city.

Eventually in my senior year of high school, I went on to get hired as a server at a small chain in my city that is known for its wide variety of food. I met some very good friends and worked there on and off for a little over four years. 

Then, in my senior year of college, I struck the gold mine. Every server’s dream. A small, upscale casual restaurant. Two rotating servers who work separate shifts and cover the entire restaurant and bartend. Our boss helps out as needed. Our kitchen has three employees, and they work every shift we’re open . There are no conflicts between servers, because it’s just one of us and my boss. There’s no conflicts with the kitchen because they have all been working here for over a decade. If they even mess up, it’s fixed in under 5 minutes. Most of the clientele has been coming to this restaurant for well over 10 years, and my boss and coworker know them all by name. They order simple drinks (usually) and a lot of times don’t even need a menu. There are a wide variety of very interesting and fun people to talk to on every shift. The price points are such that if the conditions are right, you can walk out with several hundred on a weeknight feeling like you weren’t even that busy. (But you do have to work, and you have to be a very good server to handle 9 tables and a bar top, while also making drinks). 

Well, as you may have guessed, it’s graduation season, and I graduate soon. I already have a job in my field, and tonight is my last shift. I walked in to work, my coworker gave me a big hug, and I found a very sweet and generous card from one of my favorite regulars waiting for me next to my time card.

The service industry has been great to me. Sure it’s been hard, and frustrating, and I’ve always hated not having my weekends. But in my city, it’s very rare that you find an hourly job where you can work two shifts and be ok for the week. It’s allowed me to focus more time on school, and spend more time with family and friends. I’ve met some unforgettable people that I’ll be friends with for a very long time. 

For those of you having a hard time with it, just remember the good things. The awesome regulars, the friends you’ve made, the kindness people can show you while you’re working. You can have some frustrating tables, sure, but all that comes of it is a good story to share and commiserate with other servers. 

The service industry hasn’t always been easy, but it certainly has been good to me. Thank you guys for your awesome stories, but remember that the good usually outweighs the bad.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to share my little thank you note to the industry. Have a good shift.",0,"Despite the ups and downs, what I’ve gained as an industry worker will stay with me always.",4

I work at a very high volume restaurant that remains busy throughout the day, just to give you some context. Also, I was training a new guy yesterday. 

Around 4:30 yesterday I had just gotten my first table, got their drink orders, put them in, and start to head to the bar to garnish the glasses. Immediately I see smoke billowing out from under the terminal next to service bar. Never see any fire but the smoke starts seeping out from other spots along the bar. I tell my table if they want to step outside that would be a good idea since it's about to get very smoky. 

Basically, to keep it short, we had an electrical fire. FD comes through, and starts to get things in order. I went out to tell my table that they'd better just go somewhere else as the bar wouldn't be making drinks anytime soon (Queue the 'aw man, really?' responses). Electrician comes through, fixes everything and we send everything on the floor through to dish. We wiped everything down and reset the restaurant within an hour and a half we were open again.

My question is: is that even legal? I wiped the tables and saw exactly how much soot was on them. This felt like a health code violation.",0,"Bar is on fire? No problem, we'll be open in a few hours.",7

Lady throws fit, insults server, tries to enact shitty revenge, gets the boot. 

This happened a couple months ago. I work in a no nonsense locally owned bar and restaurant that's been a community staple for over 30 yrs. My owner is the reason I say we're no nonsense as he will never be bullied or coerced by customers and is 100% willing to lose potential money to protect his staff's dignity. 

The place is usually slower paced since there aren't a ton of tables but it can get really crazy on weekend nights. We had a wait at the door and a line on the sidewalk one Friday when I was behind the bar. I'm in the weeds just trying to work through them when a woman who's looking furious saunters up to my bar.

She starts with those beautiful words everyone wants to hear, ""Go get your manager right now."" Accompanied by a straight up evil glare. Okay lady. I walk into the kitchen to find my boss who we'll call Mark. As I approach Mark and start saying some woman wants to talk with you, another server Anna (a serving manager) comes running up asking if it's a woman with short blonde hair who looks pissed. I confirm and she quickly gives the real version of things. 

The table ordered drinks and got them and have been waiting about 25-30 mins for their food, which is slow but not unreasonably so when we are at absolute capacity with parties and all that. The lady has been particularly combative with Anna whose a veteran server and can handle a lot and is kind of a bitch herself, so I know this lady must be something special. Mark asks me to locate both the drink ticket and the kitchen ticket for the table so I take time away from my bar to do that while my cobartender magically takes on the rest of the bar. 

So Mark goes behind the bar and this woman starts SCREAMING (and drawing all the bar attention to her) about how they've been waiting for well over an hour for four meals that she could ""cook at home in 20 minutes!"" Mark lets her rant for a minute before I return and hand him both tickets. As she comes to the end of her dramatic speech Mark calmly produces her drink ticket which was put in just 34 minutes ago, and since she had her drinks already how in the world had she been waiting over an hour for her food? And then he shows her the food ticket, time stamped for 29 minutes ago exactly. She starts freaking out claiming we're lying until Mark asks her to explain how we could change a timestamp on an old ticket.

The lady obviously has no comeback and starts legit shouting ""Well it feels like it's been an hour! And your server was such a bitch about it!!"" And retreats to her table where two minutes later the table next to them (who were dear regulars) approach Anna saying how they overheard the table planning on letting the food get delivered, ruining it, and then walking out without paying. As this is happening our food runner is walking out with their tray and Mark stops her, tells her to follow him to the table then proceeds to demand the table pay for their consumed drinks, look at and long for the delicious tray of food they could have been enjoying right then, and then leave his establishment to never return. 

They put up a big fuss but eventually forked over the 15 bucks with no tip and stormed out. Coworkers and I got to split up their uneaten food tho, so thank you lady that can't estimate time for shit!",0,"""But it FEELS like it's been an hour!""",430

I was working with two other servers, one of which was relatively new (called ""Patrick""). He is the one that seats them and grabs their drinks. 

At this time my other coworker, ""Bethany"", tells me that this family comes in every few months. They always get a lot of food, and the mom is demanding and rude. Bethany tells me that last time they left their baby's dirty diaper on the table- not even in a bag or anything. Just a dirty diaper lying on the table. I do recall seeing them a few times before, but I've never had them as my table.

Bethany and I listen to Patrick's interactions with them as he takes their order. Their order is huge and very complicated- lots of substitutions. They wanted to substitute inexpensive items for expensive ones, without charge. They assure him they are ""regulars"" and we ""always do this for them"". He stays kind and patient the whole time, took maybe 15 minutes to take their order.

Their apps are brought out in a timely manner, and then their food. I check Patrick's ticket and help bring out the food to make sure their complicated order is correct. It is.

For the next 20-30 minutes, I tend to my own tables and I see Patrick check on them a few times. Everything fine. Well 5 minutes later, Bethany comes up to me and says the mom is threatening not to pay. She said they've had awful service, been ignored by their server, and that he was a jerk the whole time.

I approach her and ask her if there's a problem.

Her: well, YEAH. I mean can we get boxes, or the check, or ANYTHING? Our server keeps ignoring us.

Me: Absolutely, I'll go grab those for you. And I just saw your server check on you a few minutes ago. 

Her: well, ok, it wasn't so much that he was ignoring us. He was just an asshole the whole time.

Me: I actually heard most of his interactions with you while I was standing in the kitchen. He was kind and patient the whole time. I will be back with your boxes and the check.

I drop the check and she looks at it. 

Her: $70?! There's no way our food cost this much. There's no way I'm paying for this!!

*I talk through every single item with her, and she tried to argue the cost of each one. Her husband alone ordered $40 worth of food. I confirmed every item with him, and pointed to each item's dish on the table*

Her: Usually the owner lets us create our own entree. She usually lets us make our own plate for $14.

Me: Well, I've been told by our owner to not allow things like that. And our owner is a male, so I don't know who you're referring to. Your husband ordered $40 worth of food, so that's what I'm charging you for. 

Her, angry: well there's no way I'm paying for all of this!!

Me, with a fake ass smile: As you can see, you have finished almost every item on the table. There were no issues with your service. Everything came out correct and in a timely manner. You are therefore expected to pay the entire amount of the tab.

*She grumbles angrily and pulls out her credit card*
I take her card and decide that I will gratuity them 20%, which is stated on our menu for parties of 5 or more, or tabs $50+.

As soon as I run the card, she storms into the serving area. She gets in my face and almost hits me. She got a notification on her phone for the credit card charge. 

Her: The bill was $70, why did you just charge me $84?!?! 

Me, with a menu in my hand: Oh! I added gratuity, as it says on our menu.

Her: WHAT?! YOU CANT DO THAT. THERES NO WAY YOU CAN DO THAT TO ME. They are CHILDREN. We do not qualify as a party of 5 or more!!

She continues yelling, cussing at me, saying ""you will pay for this. This isn't the last you'll be hearing from me! I'm going to call my bank! I'm going to talk to your owner!!""

While I've ""moved up"" in the sense from starting at a place where they'll hire pretty much anyone to now at a place where they expect new servers to have serving experience, I feel like stuck at sort of this ""average"" place. I'm not a terrible server, but I'm not great...I'm just average. 

One of the things I'm trying to work is my pace. I move slower than most of my coworkers cause I feel like if I go faster I'll make mistakes and I'd rather be a bit slower and make fewer mistakes and have fewer accidents cause I'm kind of a clutz. As a result, many of them can take 6, 7, or even 8 tables and I'm pretty much maxed out at 4, I can do 5, maybe 6 but it weeds me out.

The other thing I'm trying to work on is selling and upselling. I'm the kind of person that HATES being sold to and the customer we've all had who doesn't open a menu because they know exactly what they want and gets the same thing every single time. Anyway, I feel kind of awkward selling things and upselling, almost like I'm bothering guests for doing so. I know it's my job and it helps both me, them, and the restaurant and all that stuff, but I struggle with it. I guess like I haven't figure out my style for selling yet? I've done things that have worked and are slowly raising my numbers (my manager's been on my ass about getting my PPA up) but yeah. 

Lately, I've been thinking about taking my side job more seriously and going all-in and working my way up to management. This summer when I'm back full-time cause of no school, I'm really going to talk about it. Yet, I feel like when I have a conversation with my manager about wanting to go into management, she's going to laugh at me (not really, she's like the nicest person ever) cause I'm not really a leader on the floor and all of this other stuff.",0,How do I become a better server?,1

It happened the day before writing this, and hopefully if non-employees read this, they'd understand a little of what it's like to work with picky ass people.

So I'm working my shift. This time making pizzas, and boxing them, which isn't what I normally do, but the manager placed me there so whatever.
My girlfriend who works with me, helps along making the pizzas but is also taking orders out in front. 

A customer walks in and asks for a pepperoni pizza, and is given a Hot N Ready that was not even 5 minutes fresh out of the oven. She says that she doesn't want that pepperoni pizza because it doesn't look like whats on the picture on the Hot N Ready Portal.

She wants it exactly how it looks on the picture.

So we put in pizza...after pizza...after pizza. And she declined all of them. Mind you, we're currently running low on supplies, and we get more every Tuesday. At the moment were making all those pizzas we only have one bag of flour left, and one rack of freshly cut dough, which can't be used until another 24 hours. So the quantity of how much pizza is made is limited.

 I decide to go up to the register myself with one more pizza out of the oven. And as  soon as I give her the pizza and the napkins I turn around hoping that she'd accept the one I gave. With no issue.

Except she didn't. She gave me the same reason. 

She wants it exactly like how it shows it on the promotion on the Hot N Ready Portals.

I tell her that those pizzas are so undercooked, and we can't keep making more because we've already gone through making 7 pepperoni pizzas and we're currently running low on supplies. She gets mad and asks for my manager. He comes by and he says those pizzas are undercooked. the customer tells us that a lady that works here has given it to her as she requested without an issue. 

The manager, looking frustrated, looks at me and tells me to put one in the crazy bread slot which is the halfway point of the oven.

 After 2½ minutes we get a pizza with bright white cheese, undercooked crust and pepperonies that looked like they were just placed on the pizza. it was difficult getting it out of it's pan in one piece because of how limp it was from the undercooked dough, but we managed to do it.

We walked up to the register, where she checked the pizza, said it was perfect, then left.

After that we were left with 7 pepperoni pizzas. 4 of them were sold and at the end of the day 3 of them weren't. 

When my girlfriend and I closed the store we didn't want the pizzas to be thrown out. We grabbed those three pies along with 3 containers of Hot N Ready Wings and gave it for free to 2 random guys in a parking lot next to our school.

The whole time I couldn't accept the fact that someone paid for and ate raw pizza.",0,Customer makes store waste merchandise just to get undercooked pizza,37

The mom is on the phone at this time and I get the others drink orders. 

The mom goes on to say “Hey hold on, I’m gonna get her drink order (the joiners)” Totally unnecessary. The drinks would be out in less than a minute... why can’t I get you guys drinks and wait till the joiner arrives?? Anyway. After the drinks are out, the family decides they’re ready to order. They get appetizers and expensive entrees, the whole time every person in the family is CHUGGING their soda. Like at a certain point, I wouldn’t even wait for them to get halfway I’d have a refill ready. So their entrees come. Joiner still nowhere to be found. (You were trying to order a drink for someone more than 30 minutes away??) 

Grandma gets a welldone pork chop which managed to come out before the rest of the family is done with their meal, I’m super happy about this because I still wanted them to enjoy the food together. Although this family was doing the classic thing that assholes do which is asking for one thing at a time despite me asking the whole time if there was anything else they needed. Anyway, they get desserts still continually chugging drinks... grandma is paying separately. Two checks. One $40 and another $148. ZERO TIP. And they hung out for another hour after paying.

A bit of backstory: About 10 years ago, I was with my then GF. We both had jobs that paid ok but we were still pretty young. We started tipping a bit more when we went out, once we left university. It was the grownup thing to do. She had some stereotypical broke musician friends that were ok but extremely cheap. E.g. They would go around asking for free stuff because of their birthday (when it wasn’t), for their new baby (no kids) or any reason that was good to scam people out of a few euro’s. Mostly harmless when it was a big corporation but it gets on my nerves when it’s a mom and pop pizza restaurant or small bar.

So we live in a country where tipping is not done the way it’s done in the US. It’s more of a “job well done” kind of statement. You did your job well; here’s a few extra bucks. You did your job exceptionally; here is a few more. But not usually more than 5% of the total bill unless you are a celebrity or something.

When we went out with the cheap couple this would be the evening:

We go out to the restaurant or bar. We eat or drink. GF and I pick what we want. They usually pick the second cheapest thing on the menu. That’s ok. It’s their choice to make. We have a good time and I laugh politely up to the point where I ask for the check. The server brings the check. We divvy up the tally.  I take out change for me and my then partner and leave a bit extra as a tip. Now, here’s the good part:

The couple never has change so they offer to pay the tab at the bar or the counter. And for us that would be it, but wait…. There’s more. They guy goes to pay and pays the exact amount of the check and pockets the change, without leaving a tip. So in effect, he took our tip money as a discount of their part of the tab and thus cheats the server out of their tip.

It took me about three times to figure this out. The next time we went out for drinks I made sure to treat them and leave a huge tip to make up for every time they cheated the servers out of their money.",0,The broke musicians steal my tip.,50

68,beer9604,0,t3_blu1uz,0,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/blu1uz/lovehate_relationship_with_owner/,"TL;DR: The owner of the restaurant I work at is probably one of the best bosses I’ve ever had, but god damn can she piss me off sometimes.

The owner of the restaurant I work at is also the manager, so she’s there every day. God bless her, she puts in tons of work. 

However, it’s very clear she’s never taken any form of a management class. It’s her way or the highway. “Because I’m the owner” is her go to response for everything. If you just smile and nod, and put up with whatever shit she throws you for your first month or two, you’ll be on her good side, which is a huge help. If she likes you, she’ll always have your back. 

Also however, her management style is quintessential nepotism. Her sons all work at the bar, and she basically wipes their butts for them. Anything they want, she makes happen. If they want off, she tells me to cover their shift. Doesn’t ask me if I can, just tells me. 

For instance, I was planning my anniversary dinner with my girlfriend, and I was going to take her into NYC, where we had our first date. I switched my shift with another guy so I could, and she says “no that won’t work, you’re bartending that day, Richard (her son the bartender) is going on vacation.” Three days before our anniversary she tells me this. I had to reschedule everything because if I didn’t, I’d be on her bad side, which you don’t want. 

On the other hand, if I need a weekend off, she will jump through hoops to help me out. If I have a problem with a table, she’ll step in to smooth things out. Whenever my family comes to visit me at work, they drink on her tab. One time I really helped out because a waitress called out at the last minute, and after the shift she came up to me and gave me a huge hug, and told me how much she appreciates everything I do around the restaurant, and gave me extra money on top of my tips. 

I love her to death, and she’s helped me out a lot, but the little things she does make me insane. This was just a little rant, to vent a bit. If anyone else shares this feeling about their boss, you feel my pain/happiness.",0,Love/Hate relationship with owner,13
69,wintertimewarp,0,t3_blckss,203,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/blckss/we_are_senior_citizens_you_must_do_something_for/,"To start this, I serve in a fast casual, family oriented sports bar-ish place. Relatively small chain. My location is a corner unit attached to a mall (windows lining front and side of restaurant) and because of this we 1) give a mall employee discount and 2) HAVE to close the blinds while the sun is setting or a handful tables and anyone in our front expo area gets absolutely blinded by the sun for a good solid 20 minutes each day. 

Husband and wife come in, pretty normal looking couple, maybe mid 50s (not people I would refer to as older at all). Get seated at a booth along a wall, but moves themselves over one to a booth in front of a window, where they open the recently closed blinds. The hostess returns and asks them to please close the blinds, and they refuse, stating that they aren’t vampires. Their first server comes over to greet them, and crazy couple (CC) immediately state they are senior citizens and want the senior citizen discount. She informs them we do not have one. They insist they are seniors and we must do SOMETHING for them (and keep in mind the server is absolutely blinded in the sun at this point). CC tells her they are members (to our rewards app I guess?) and have been for years so they want some kind of discount. They go back and forth, finally order two drinks from the bar, and CC insists the server talk to the manager about “what we can do for them since they are members AND senior citizens”. 

Manager (M) is sent over. First thing M does is insist they close the blinds. CC again refuse, and M tells them she can move them elsewhere but the blinds will be closed. They agree to move. And this is when I get the pleasure of meeting CC. 

By the time I get to them, they have their drinks. He is annoyed that no one brought him ice for his Coors Lt (he didn’t ask?). One member of CC is allegedly a manager at a department store in the mall, and M said she could give them a mall employee discount. They are content with this, but they make sure I am aware of their 10% discount like 3 times in 20 seconds. 

I start to take their food order. Keep in mind we are a sports bar, and the food pretty well fits the theme.

Woman: I will have the black bean burger. 
Me: Sounds good. Fries okay with that?
Woman: Oh no, I need something healthier than that. 
Me: We have coleslaw as an additional option?
Woman: No, how about a side salad. 
Me: Sure
Woman: With spinach.
Me: We do not have a spinach side salad. It’s a romaine blend.
Woman: Romaine is good. All romaine?
Me: No, it’s an 80/20 blend with iceberg.
Woman: Oh no, that’s not okay. I am allergic to iceberg.
Man (to woman): How about the broccoli honey?
Me: We don’t have broccoli.
Man: Oh, you don’t?
Woman: Well, you have carrots. You can just cook some of those up for us.
Me: We don’t have carrots.
Woman (getting super huffy at point): Well then what DO you have that is healthy?
Me: The coleslaw isn’t bad.
Woman: Well, actually it has mayonnaise in it, so you’re wrong on that one.
Me (trying so hard to keep being nice): Actually, our coleslaw is not dairy (should have said mayo) based. It’s vinegar based.
Woman: Well I guess we are just going to have to skip the side then. But we will take that burger on a whole wheat bun.
Me: No, sorry, we don’t have whole wheat buns.
Woman: Whole wheat toast. Whatever it is.
Me: We do not have whole wheat anything. 
Woman: Seriously? Well then no bread at all. 
Me (turning to man): And what can I get started for you?
CC: Oh no, we are sharing. 

Great. Put the order in. It’s literally a BB burger with cheese, pico, and an onion ring on top, and they are splitting it. 

I stop by as soon as the food is delivered. The man has just pulled the onion ring onto his plate. Women snatches the plate and shoves it into my hands. He says he wants the onion ring, and she SCOLDS HIM and tells him no, turns to me again and instructs to please get it out of here now. He says well, okay. It is really awkward and I eventually walk away with the onion ring while he is telling her he really wanted that. I keep the manager up to date on the weirdness of all of this, and tell her “I know they are gong to be mad when the discount doesn’t include their drinks” because I can see this coming a mile away. Also, it’s happy hour so their drinks are already half hour because we have a pretty banging HH.

They wrap up their meal, I offer dessert. They decline but order two more drinks and the check. I bring the check, the drinks, and a fresh cup of ice. I am summoned over a minute later.

Man: So, in all the years I went to school, when I graduated high school, and college, all the colleges I went to-
Woman: Harvard
Man: -yes, Harvard. At the top of my class, all the time. And I know math, and 10% of $18.60 is not .88. 
Me: The discount only comes off of food.
Man: Right, well something is still not adding up.
Me: No, it adds up perfectly.
Throw in a few more “all the school and colleges I went to” jabs by them both.
Man: The sandwich was at least $10.
Me, grabs receipt: The sandwich was $8.79. 10% of that is .88.
Woman: I’m thinking it should be at least $2.00
Man: Yes, anything over, well you know, it should be closer to at least $1.75.
Me (so fucking over this): 10% of $10 is $1. Your sandwich was less than $10. Your discount is less than $1.
Woman: I worked at a top ten bar in California before (blah blah long story about supposedly best bar ever) and WE gave discounts on drinks.
Me: Cool. Well everyone restaurant I have ever worked in, served in and managed, has never given discounts on alcohol. It’s pretty common. No discount touches alcohol.
Man: Well last year on my birthday I got a free birthday drink.
Me: Okay.
Woman: Well he can show you his ID. His birthday is coming up.
Man: Why don’t you go talk to your manager and see if they can get that done for me again this year.
Me: I have never seen free birthday drink, ever. But sure, I will get my manager.

Manager goes over. Nicely-ish tells them to kick rocks. 

They pay their bill, tell me to keep the change (thanks for the .60 tip!). Last thing I hear from them is the man loudly and dramatically telling his wife how his beer “tastes JUST LIKE WATER! SERIOUSLY, TASTE IT! WATER!” 

Bro, you put a WHOLE cup of ICE in a COORS LIGHT that you gave been sipping on. What on earth did you expect.

And they were vampires, btw. Time sucking vampires. Because between the first server, the manager, and I, we easily spent 30 minutes at their actual table. 


TL;DR: Crazy couple insists on senior citizen discount that we don’t have, tries to order a ton of food we don’t have and is mad we don’t have it. Insinuates I am stupid because they can’t do math. Mad that discount they did get didn’t cover their alcoholic drinks. Leaves me $0.60.

I had a guest try to order a bar drink tonight and when I asked for her ID, she shuffled through her wallet then said she had left it at home.
She asked me, “Do you really need it? I’m 26.”

It’s not a big deal when people ask this. However, it is ILLEGAL for me to sell you alcohol after asking for your ID and not being shown a valid, non-expired, proper form of ID. Meaning, State ID, any state driver license, passport, military ID.

I also recently had another lady who was upset because she gave me a paper (temporary) ID that expired TWO years ago. She gave me this after shuffling through (no joke) a 4 inch stack of cards from her wallet (that was actually a makeup bag to fit her stack full of cards)
I’d seen a glimpse of multiple different IDs as she was going through them and then when she handed me an expired, temporary ID from two years ago, I told her it wasn’t valid and she demanded to speak to a manager and then when he told her that he couldn’t accept it, she left.

I just hate when people have the audacity to get upset or annoyed with me for following the policy and doing my job and doing what I need to do to KEEP my job.

My ex-girlfriend (who is also a server) actually had an issue where she didn’t ID someone and served them alcohol, but there was an undercover ALE (alcohol law enforcement) officer who had the whole thing set up. She was given a citation, fired from her job, and could’ve been arrested. Thankfully, the charges were dismissed after she attended an alcohol safety class and it’s not on her record and she got another job very quickly.
Ever since then, I ID everyone.

This particular family of 4 comes in regularly, I remember all the preferences of each family member and last night they came in asking for a table for 18 people because they’re celebrating a birthday, I kept in mind to be extra careful with their table because the family I knew is super picky with each ingredient in their food, I imagined the same for their relatives.

Took me about 10 minutes to take everyones order, they all had something they wanted to change about their food but everything went smoothly. We don’t do anything at all for birthdays, we don’t have any dessert items on our menu either so they brought their own cake. I got for their birthday candles lit and the cake sliced for them because our restaurant has a policy that we can’t give out knives to our customers (we don’t even have plastic knives), everything is still going well and everyone looks happy! 

I go to print their bill but my coworker told me one of the ladies came up to the till to pay halfway through their meal to ensure that no one else pays. The bill was around $320, she tipped $15... I was hoping she mistook $15 for 15% and my coworker said she insisted that the tip was $15. 

Later on, when the family was leaving one of the guys grabs me by the shoulder and tells me, “hey, we left you some cake thanks for being such a great waitress!” I said thanks and he turns around to the rest of the family that’s trickling out the door and yells, “no one wants to take this cake home, right?!” One girl looks back and says “definitely not.” Guy turns back to me and tells me to enjoy the cake.

There were several things that made my boss upset; her order was not modified the way she wanted; the table got the wrong refill after our first glass (unsweet tea over sweet tea); being asked whether we were ready for our checks twice through our stay; and finally when we were ready for checks, getting the split completely wrong.

Now, none of this is a big deal to me. Actually, they’re all easy fixes. It’s super late at night, and I do not expect the most lavish service from a casual diner like iHop. In fact, that’s why I love iHop.

After everything was settled, I try to drop down cash to pay for the bill and also tip. I planned to at least tip a solid 18%, but my boss was adamant about me not tipping at all. So we paid for the food only and left.

I felt horrible. Like, my stomach felt like it was down in my groin and my heart was in my throat. It was just not a good feeling, and I had to go back and apologize.

So I did.

I went back ten minutes later to find her, and when she saw me it looked like she was afraid. She asked me in a really soft and polite tone, “Did you guys forget something?”

I explained to her that I didn’t agree with my boss having to drag management about something that could have easily been fixed. She started to cry, telling me that my manager made her tear up earlier.

I handed her a $20 (the tab itself was around $24) and told her that I don’t know her, but she could have had a hard night for all I knew. She told me her past several weeks had been very hard on her. We exchanged hugs as she thanked me in tears. I wished her good night and left.

77,m_den,0,t3_blg7m3,13,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/blg7m3/the_rudest_table_ive_ever_had/,"First time poster, I usually take my shitty tables in stride, but this table was so awful I had to get it out here.

To preface, I work at a classic corporate bullshit restaurant. I.E. the customer is always right, comps out the wazoo to satisfy petty people, and a chaotic kitchen that is the root of most of our issues.

A great set up for people who you know are just looking to complain, or order their server around and abuse them.

So I get this 8 top. 5 Adults (one who arrived late) 2 kids and a screaming baby.
Now I'll grant them this, having hungry children and a fussy baby on a busy Sunday morning can be a recipe for grumpiness.
However, I greeted them the second they sat down and rounded them up their drinks and bread within five minutes.

Immediatedly they ask for appetizers, shouting over each other and belaying one another's orders. Ignoring me when I repeat the order to make sure I get it right.

Finally, I put it in and go about my other tables as one of the women has gone off to calm her baby, I assume they'll need some time to order.
A few minutes pass and she's still not there, so I go by and they tell me they want to order anyway.

I grab it, ask if they want more bread (yes), check refills and as I'm putting in food, their appetizers come out. It had taken ten minutes max, and they ordered two breakfast tacos and some taquitos. A large amount of appetizers for even 8 people.

Their food is now in, they're laughing to eachother, drinks are full, etc. Etc. I wander by to clear off plates and box the last bit of taco. As I go by the kitchen screen, I see their entrees are at 22 minutes and they're just waiting on one more entree, a breakfast burrito.

I head back out and this exact exchange happens:

Me: Hey guys, shouldn't be more than a couple minutes on your food now, they're working on the burrito and then it'll be out.

Lady #1: (In the most snide and condescending tone imaginable) How long is our good going to take it's been a long time.

I stare for a minute because I literally JUST said it would be a few minutes, did she want specifics? I dunno. But at this point it also hadn't been over 22 minutes for 8 breakfast dishes.
Pretty reasonable for our restaurant anyway.

So I repeat myself, acknowledging that it's been a hot minute, but that it wouldn't be long.
She looks at her watch and complains that it's been a ridiculous amount of time.

Here's the thing. It may, I acknowledge, not make me the best server, but when people speak to me in a way that makes it clear I'm their slave not their server, I shut down.

I didn't apologize to her, I didn't validate her rudeness and just said ""I'll go check on it.""

I hear them murmuring and snickering as I walk away.

As I go back, food comes up and I start running it out. I specifically handed a waffle to the woman at the end and my fellow servers help me run out the rest.
As I'm walking back to the kitchen to make sure we got everything, another table pulls me aside and I get distracted for a moment.

I head back to the kitchen, see the ticket has been bumped off, and head back out to check on them. Everything is there except the stupid burrito. And now the lady is pissed, saying it's been ten minutes and all their food still isn't out.

The second woman wants to see a manager. Sure, I grab my manager and he talks to them.

And this is where I get pissed because at this point I've done everything I can to make this smooth for these people and my manager comes back pissed, saying I haven't been attentive, that they need refills (I'd already rung in two more before he came by), etc.

They all want boxes immediatedly and a seperated bill.
Fine, get them out of here.
I grab boxes and a check and they then yell at me for not having taken anything off the bill.

Well, I assumed my manager would have done that if he'd intended to after he talked to them.
So I offer to take it back.
They tell me then that they never got the waffle.....that I set down for them.
And that should be taken off.

Not willing to argue with these people, I take it back to my other manager (as the original one was now on the line) explain the situation to her and she comps of almost the entire thing after talking to them, but not before accusing me of never bringing them their damn waffle.

The worst part of this entire thing were my managers. Who immediately took these rude people's side, ignored my record as an excellent server, threatened to shrink my section and then micromanaged and talked to my tables for the rest of my shift.

Makes me genuinely want to quit.

For background: I work in a major city in the US near several theaters so a majority of our business comes from the pre- and post-show rush. It had been a long weekend with a particular dance troupe across the street at the largest theatre, and I had clopened as a Sunday double.

Come the end of my Sunday double, minutes after being cut, I decide to keep my full section because I had already gone through the stress of a flat seating in &lt;5 minutes, I may as well have the money. 

The tables were all women mostly in their 70s/80s enjoying a very early dinner. Most of my tables were sweet, all but one table started every order with “I have a few questions.” The only one that didn’t was the one that lead to me cursing them days later. 

They order two margaritas and a house red sangria, we make our sangrias in house and they’re booze with a splash of juice. I drop their drinks, put in their appetizer order (eggplant fries and taquitos.)

The table flags me over and seat three tells me that the sangria is the weakest thing she’s ever had, she’ll just have a margarita. Alright. Sure. My manager rolls his eyes and we carry on. 

I drop their eggplant fries and their taquitos are up as I’m rolling silverware, and I ask my manager to run it because I can’t go to their again yet. I’m done with the day and they’re the end of the line. 

He places the taquitos, I’m standing next to the open kitchen, and she frowns and asks him (the convo retold to me by him) if that’s cheese she sees on the plate and he says yes, was there not supposed to be cheese? She says she didn’t know there was cheese and that she’s allergic. He asks if they want a new one, so he takes it off the table and she informs him that’s wise unless he wants to perform CPR that night. After all this, he asks if I knew and I said no, especially since she ordered the BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN as an entree. 

I grab a menu and politely storm over to the table and squeakily ask, “you have a dairy allergy?” My voice breaking glass as I finish the sentence. 

“Oh yes.”
“Then the buttermilk fried chicken won’t really be an option for dinner...”
“Oh. No, it wouldn’t.”

So I'm managing at a new, very small family owned restaurant. I worked for the previous owner of this location, but I stayed on to work for this new family renting the space when they left. For our grand opening we gave a free cup of coffee and a free dessert with the purchase of every meal, because, well, it's the grand opening. 

On this day I had a customer who seemed really nice. He got something to go and was happily surprised when we gave him a dessert with his order. He was so thrilled, in fact, that his wife called us later that day to say the dessert was amazing and asked if we will be selling it regularly on the menu. Over all, a fabulous interaction that restored some of my faith in humanity. 

Fast forward to yesterday (just two days later). In walks that same customer. He tells me he isn't there to buy, but instead wanted to give me some business advice. I asked if he would like to speak with the owner since I don't make business decisions, but he refused and said he would only speak to me. 

He proceeds to tell me that he has many, many, many friends in the area and heard that some of them were unhappy with their breakfasts that morning. I immediately asked him why with genuine concern. He told me there was not enough food for that price. Now, let me just say, our menu is crazy cheap. Our breakfasts run between $7 and $9.75 Canadian ($3.75 for kids). It's all fresh too - no liquid eggs or frozen meat. It's quality food at an insanely reasonable price. 

He continues to tell me just how cheap eggs, potatoes, and coffee is and says if we intend to keep customers we need to offer at least 4 eggs, a mountain of potatoes, bigger salad, more fruit &amp; meat, and three slices of toast. And then in addition offer free unlimited coffee and a dessert for about $5. 

Obviously I can't explain to him why this would never work, so I simply said, ""I'll let the owner know your thoughts. Thank you for the feedback."" To which he replied, ""And just so you know, I frequent all the bars in the area and my wife is one of those ladies that knows everyone and loves gossip. When we tell people about you guys - which we will - we want it to be good things. So make some changes.""

I'm honestly at a loss. How entitled are people these days? They're getting a plate full of quality food for less than they would pay at (insert popular fast food locations) that use frozen everything and don't cook to order.

So I work at a Mexican restaurant. Yesterday being Cinco de Mayo, we had a huge turn out of people. The cocktail area tables are cleared out and they use that area as a giant dance floor with beer tubs, shot girls, etc. In order to gain access to this area, you need to get a wristband at the front entrance so no one underage can get in. There’s another hallway that leads into the cocktail/dance party area, but we had put a table there so no one can sneak in. If people tried to move the table to get by, we’d just kindly tell them they’d need to walk around. No biggie.

Enter Douchebag Dan. Now Dan is a regular here, in his mid 50’s - early 60’s. You’ll find him sitting at the bar 7 nights a week until close, trying to befriend the bartenders and servers (you know the type). I’ve never had a conversation with Dan, nary a “hello”. 
Anywho, around 2:30 pm, I’m standing at the bar waiting for my drink orders, which happens to be right next to the shitty table blockade. I feel the table start pushing into me as someone is trying to go through, and I hit em with the whole, “sorry, you have to go around”. Obviously, it’s ol’ Dan trying to get through. He looks me square in the eyes and says, “...nahh I’m going through” and continues on his way. The arrogance and the ‘holier than thou’ attitude rubbed me the wrong way, but I just let it go.
I ran into my manager a few minutes later and told him about the incident, and just how everyone in general was trying to mosey on through; he said he’d talk with dan about it and let him know to go around.

SO 20 minutes later, my other manager asks me to pop out back and check on something insignificant. I stroll on over and make my way through the dumb table, and suddenly I hear,

“YoU cAn’T gO tHrOuGh ThErE!!!”

Duh. Of course it’s Dan. 

He walks on up to me at an uncomfortably close distance, he’s already drunk, and the ‘conversation’ goes like this:

Me: uh actually I can, because I work here

DD: I’m fucking with you! You need to lighten up!

Me: look, you don’t get special treatment because you’re a regular. You have to go around like all the other patrons 

DD: yes I do! I do get special treatment!!!

Me: no, you don’t

DD: well I talked to the manager, and he says it’s fine for me to go through here!

Me: no, you didn’t. Because I, in fact, talked to the manager, and you’re not allowed this way. Is that all?

Dan gets upset. He’s been called out. He’s drunk  . He just wants to argue. He gets in my face and is yelling whatever the hell point he’s trying to make, but luckily I cannot hear his drunken ramble over the music. 
I tell Dan to fuck off, and continue on my way.
After I walked away, I’m told Dan kissed both of his biceps as some sort of victory (???)

Over the course of the night, I see dan grab multiple women half his age and force them to dance with him. They look incredibly uncomfortable. Management keeps an eye on him. 9 o’clock rolls around. I round the corner and behold an incredible sight:
There’s Dan, surrounded by 5 security guards. Apparently he tried to fight some  innocent dudes trying to have a good time. Dan is flailing his arms. His eyes look like they’re going to pop out of their sockets. Half of the servers and patrons are crowded around watching him. He sees me from afar and just points his finger at me, as if I’ve caused this somehow.

Long story short, he gets kicked out.
But wait! There’s more!
Dan thinks it’s a great idea to try and drive home drunk. All 4 of my managers go out in the pouring rain to try and stop him. They offer to get him a Lyft, even have one of the bartenders drive him home. Nope. Dan insists on driving. He’s so insistent, in fact, that he tries to fight one of my managers. The cops were called, and Douchebag Dan spent a night in the drunk tank.

Tonight we had slightly over 100 covers, and a table of 6 demanding, rude, and entitled middle aged women. 

From the getgo, one of the women was not happy because an item we have at lunch is not on the dinner menu. I was helping out the lone server and took this tables order. I made a lighthearted comment that it was incentive to come into lunch now so that they could get it, and the lady glares at me and says she already does, in a snarky voice. 

Later, I bring over a margarita to their table and the woman who ordered it asked for no salt but it had salt on it. I guess this had already happened once this evening. The lunch menu lady mentioned previously then says to me, the service is lacking, you guys really need to to better, this has already happened once this evening- again in her snarky voice.

The women finish their meal, and the same lady says on her way out that the service was horrible tonight. I look at their checks and two of them didn’t leave a tip, and two others also wrote “the service sucked. Yelp!” , and “bad service!”

I know that by no means did their service suck that horribly, but there were errors made this evening, I will admit. People sitting at the bar definitely had their service backed up as well as the bartender was handling drinks for the tables as well as taking orders and making drinks for bar guests. 

These women were so rude and demanding, totally oblivious to the fact that we had one server, and it was in the rush of dinner service while they were dining. 

On a night that the number of covers should have seen two servers, I think we did a fine job overall. If you have a bad attitude of course you are going to not be pleased with your dining experience. Everyone at the bar had a longer wait than normal but were all understanding.

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading. I just needed to vent about it- customers can be so frustrating and ignorant to what is going on around them.

I work in a very affluent city on the outskirts of Los Angeles, so evidently a good portion of our clientele consists of fairly wealthy people. Our restaurant is very nice, has a good atmosphere and don’t feel smothered by a “breathe-down-your-neck” management. 
That being said, we are completely aware of the type of service we need to provide and do our best to cater to the somewhat peculiar entitled guests who feel like the world revolves around them. All in all, it’s a great place to work. 
However, Wednesday got the best of me. 

I was serving which I do once or twice a week aside from mainly bartending and was sat a 2-top of elderly women. I let them get settled then scurry on over. I do my usual greet, ask if they would like to start with something to drink blah blah... 
*“You can come back later. We’re not ready”* one of them sternly tells me. 
*“Okay no problem, I will come back to check on you”*
Finally, they settle on Old Fashions. They, of course, need more time to look at the menu and I leave them be. 

When I come back to the table, the older of the 2 tells me how upset she is; *She wanted one of our larger booth, but was denied because it was reserved. I apologized and told her I understood. She went on to say, that she felt discriminated because the booth was now occupied by a couple and because they didn’t have **a male** with them, they were sat at the table they’re sitting in right now* ( I should also mention that their table was also a booth. A corner booth meant for 2-3 tops. She wanted the long booth that fit 4-7 people, we didn’t have any available, 2 of them were sat and the last one was reserved) I leave and let my manager know the deal (my manager sat her, so she half expected a complaint to come back at some point) 

Their food gets delivered without a problem. 
I check on them and the older one orders *a house cabernet*  I ring it in and go get it at the bar. I don’t want this table to leave unhappy, if I can settle them with everything they need, I’ll feel much better. I grab the wine, return to the table and deliver her drink. 
*“Here is your Cabernet...”*
She looks at me annoyed and says 
*“I ordered a Chardonnay!!”*
Okay guys look, I’m a bartender who speaks fluent French, I know my wines and I swear to you guys, I heard Cabernet but okay.. that’s not what she wants, so let’s fix my mistake. I profusely apologize to her and tell her *I’ll be right back with her Chard*.
 As I was walking away I hear her scoff really loudly while her friend laughs. I’m annoyed but understanding... I just want to extinguish this fire and smooth out the rest of their experience. On my way to the bar, I explain to my manager the situation and she tells me to inform her the glass of wine is on us. Perfect! I grab her Chardonnay and hurry over to the table. I drop it off and tell her to not worry about it, and that *we are offering it to her on the house*.
She smiles and nods...
Whew! ... 

Next to the elderly 2 top was another table of mine, a husband and wife.  He had ordered a rib-eye, wanted the rest boxed up but decides to  start complaining that his steak was not a perfect medium rare. 
Are you serious? Why didn’t he say something when I checked on them during 2 minutes 2 bites, or when he got another beer later on? You decide to say something when the entire thing is almost eaten? And makes a scene in front of my other table from Hell... I leave to grab husband/wife’s check, our POS is facing my two crabby tables and while I’m printing out the check, I see eldest lady roll her eyes at my husband/wife table and shakes her head. Clearly, making fun of me.

**now look, there were gaffes but these people are acting like complete jerks. I was polite, helpful and as hospitable as I possibly could be and God fucking forbid they’re going to treat service staff like this. I didn’t deserve any of this** 

I drop off the check at husband/wife’s table and turn to eldest lady. I get on my knee leveling eye to eye with her and nicely ask her *“ma’am.. what’s going on? I would like to know why you are so upset with us at this point? You are rolling your eyes at other customers, displeased. What is the problem?”*
She starts complaining *how terrible we are, the food sucked, everything just sucked and she will come back but she is not happy tonight* (she took the rest of her food to go though- clearly it didn’t suck that much) 
I look at her and say *ma’am I am so sorry about your booth, as I already mentioned we had a reservation. I offered the wine glass because it was truly my mistake but I’m sorry you feel so strongly about your entire experience here*
I get up, put their check on their table and tell her *I’m sorry that she feels that way* and walk away. 

I had enough. 
They still left me $20 on $96.00 and so did the husband/wife table. I take my job seriously, but this was too much. 
I had never stood up to a table that way and you guys.. it felt so good.

To start the day off I am alerted by the hostess that a banned person is up front trying to order food.  This person has been warned twice in the past 10 days that they are not allowed to go into any of the restaurants due to them stalking one of my employees.  I alert security and they go over to let him know that not only can he not come inside, he has now earned a one week ban from the entire property.  He ends up making a huge scene about it before being physically removed.

Secondly, I am standing up front when an elderly couple asks for a table.  The woman has a styrofoam cup that appears to be from the free beverage station next to the restaurant.  I let her know that our policy is that she cannot bring that cup inside the restaurant.  She makes a HUGE FUCKING DEAL about this, which is ridiculous because it's free soda, and she can grab another one when she leaves.  Ultimiately she demands that I hold the cup for her at the host podium until she is ready to leave.  Well, all this drama makes me suspicious so I smell the contents of the cup, and sure enough it's booze.  It is illegal for people to drink on the casino floor, so I alert security who takes the cup and is waiting for the couple when they leave the restaurant.

Thirdly, one of my bartenders who is providing service in the poker room tells me that a poker player is saying racist shit about Mexicans (she's obviously hispanic) and staring right at her while saying it.  So I call security again (they have to be getting tired of me at this point) and I go tell the guy that he needs to cash in his chips and leave.  He starts to argue and I tell him if he goes quietly and behaves himself it's a one day ban.  If he wants to throw a fit the ban will be longer.  He wisely takes the second option and scoots out with his tail between his legs.

I do care that people get what they want, though, and don’t ruin their diet choices just because they go out to eat. I tell the kitchen so they can prep new utensils and make a note to check every dish that needs the vegan modifications myself.

I clear the menus from the table. 
I copy the info for the vegan apps, salads, 4 entrees and a dessert that we offer onto a receipt slip and go to talk to them. The table is too chatty to pay attention to me when I try to announce the options, so I go around (2-3 at a time) sharing the options. They can’t decide right away. I rotate to the next group. All in all, it took me 25 full minutes to take this table’s order. 
My other 8-top and 3 3-tops aren’t thrilled. One table had just been sat by the hostess as a i started the order, so they walked out (understandably) after nobody came and greeted them in 20 minutes. 
A few minutes later, the leader vegan asks me for a drink menu. Nobody else ordered liquor, so I’m happy to oblige. 

I explain, “We don’t have a separated drink menu. The food and drink are all together in a tri-fold. However, I have a full bar, plenty of wine and taps, what are you looking for?”

Nah. He wants to see the cocktails we make. After a full 15 seconds of deliberation where he literally put both hands to his head, his partner touched his shoulder and told him to just look at a menu. I flip it to the drinks only side before I hand it to him. 

Vegan options are 30-50% cheaper than our regular entrees, so naturally, this is a small check for the size of the party. I did better off the 8 top celebrating a birthday.

This was a few days ago, and we were way busier than usual. I’m talking busy up until 9:00, when we normally die out around 7:45. It was a mess. 

That night, we were short a person, so I was running front with one other person, and we were doing alright save for the fact that orders were coming in faster than we could take them out. 

Enter The Manager (TM). TM came in with her entire family, and was very smug from the beginning. She boasted about knowing how to “make everything on this menu better than anyone here” and a myriad of other things I didn’t care to listen to or remember. 

They order and sit down, and here’s where it gets interesting. At this point, we are almost drowning. Like running back and forth, never enough breadsticks in the oven, expo full to the brim kind of drowning. 

I stepped outside to take out some food, and as I am turning around to go back inside, she comes up behind me. She very clearly says to me “What the fuck is her problem? Doesn’t she know it’s the fucking dinner rush and she needs to have chicken?”

Now, this would be bad from a customer. But this is a MANAGER. From ANOTHER STORE. Speaking that way to any employee is absolutely unacceptable, but an employee in the same franchise? Come on now. I mumbled some incoherent excuse and walked in the opposite direction.

She sits down with her family, and I can feel her watching me like a hawk. Every time I walk past her table her eyes are on me and don’t leave until I’m out of her sight. It was very distracting, and made it incredibly hard to perform. 

She leaves, and I figure that’s the last of it. Until we get a call from our GM.

Apparently she had called corporate and spun a lie about what was happening during her meal. She said that customers were calling her store and complaining about employees fighting and threatening to walk out. (While none of us really want to be there, none of us will threaten to walk out either. It’s really not that serious.)

Now, there’s two things wrong with this:

1: why would customers from OUR STORE call HER STORE to complain instead of saying something to us?

2: how did she get the “customer complaints” from her store if she wasn’t there? Now I realize cell phones are a thing, but she didn’t pick up her cell once during her meal. Hell, I didn’t even SEE it out. So is the good lord himself messaging her or....?

In reality, she was being incredibly nosy, disrespectful, and she stepped way out of her bounds. I can’t believe the audacity of some people once they’re given a sliver of power.

So I use to wait tables at this tiny, local family diner. I was there for two years our clientele were mostly with bull headed old people so I’ve dealt with some shit, but this one lady just takes the whole cake. 

She comes in on a slowish day with her husband, they weren’t off the bat rude but not friendly either just kinda meh about everything. I grab their drinks and go to take their order.

“Well I’m vegan so I’m not the best person to ask but I heard so and so is pretty good!” And she just kinda looks at me and says “you’re vegan? But...you’re fat?”  My jaw hit the floor! I couldn’t believe someone would even think to say this to somebody! I just open mouth stared at her and she starts ordering like she didn’t just insult me!

The coworker in question, a girl a year younger than I am who we will call Karen, started about a week and a half later. At first I liked her. I did think there always seemed to be something, like she'd come into every shift with something new to complain about (I should add that none of these things were anything serious or out of the ordinary, ie things that I and everyone else who has been through high school or has worked a day in their life has also faced), but it didn't bother me at first.

Recently I've been getting a lot more hours now that it's getting busier (I'm part time, but because I'm available full time, I'm good at my job and the manager and owner both like me, I'm getting given the extra hours above her which isn't sitting well with her) so that means splits galore. Usually if someone is on a split, the manager will let them off early at night once things calm down a little and they can cope with one less person, but the lady few weeks, that hasn't been happening to me. I've been kept to the bitter end which I don't mind because I actually enjoy my job, I like my coworkers and my manager, and it's more money for me. But it does mean that by about 9 o'clock in the dinner shift, I'm getting pretty tired. So listening to her, who has just finished school and so is free all day until she starts work in the evening, complain about being so tired gets kind of frustrating.

On the rare occasion that she is on a split, you better believe you won't be allowed to forget it. She won't shut up about how tired she is BECAUSE she's on aplit. To quote on of the other girls, ""it's not like the mojority of us work 9-5 day jobs and then come on here again at night or anything"". Our staff is made up of one full time girl, a couple schoolgirls who have just finished and are currently sitting exams (Karen being one of them), me (one year out of school and still not a clue what she wants to do with her life), and about 10 others who work full time day jobs plus 3 or 4 shifts in the restaurant a week. Not one of them complain.

God forbid Karen have a cold. She'll be coughing and sniffing dramatically in your ear all damn night and making a point of telling everyone how bad her cold is.

If the chance comes for someone to go home early, she'll jump at it and not offer anyone else to go. I will very rarely volunteer myself for this. Unless the manager specifically says to ME that I can go home, I will tell someone else to take the early finish. But on Saturday it was busy but much quieter than we're used to on a Saturday night and the manager told us all at 9 that he could send someone home. I was tired, I admitted it then and there, it had been a long week, and I wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed, so I said for the first time that if no one else minded, I'd like to go home. The other three girls were fine with it, except HER. I could see her chewing on her lip and giving everyone puppy dog eyes, just begging someone to so ""oh, does Karen want to go"". I'm gonna be honest, I decided to be a petty bitch and asked the other girls several times if they were sure none of them wanted to go as they were planning to go out after work. I walked out that door and said in the sweetest voice I could possibly muster ""have a nice night guys, see you on Monday, Karen!!""

I could tell she wanted to go, but she ALWAYS leaves early to get a bus while the rest of us stay and finish up. The other night, we had a function on downstairs and when they left, myself and another girl went to clear and reset it and I said the Karen that table x, y and z still needed glasses/spoons that we never seemed to have enough of when we needed them. She came down to see the manager about 5 minutes later (he was next door to the function room where all the cleaning stuff is) and told him she needed to go for her bus. He asked her if anything needed up in the restaurant and she said no. She was let off to go for her bus. Skip to about 15 minutes later, the function room is done so we go upstairs. The glasses still aren't on the tables. Neither are the spoons. Various other things she was supposed to do before she left weren't done either. So I had the pleasure of staying an extra 15 minutes to finish what she should have finished.

In general, she's not very good at the job. I'm not saying I'm perfect, I make mistakes, but she does certain things that just makes me think... What the fuck?! I don't know how things are done elsewhere, but where I live and work, asking a customer ""do you want your change"" when they hand you cash is a big no-no. Tips are not mandatory, we don't have a service charge. It's optional. And they can tip however little or however much as they like. Karen asks people if they want their change. Myself and some of the other girls have told her not to say it because it's basically asking them to tip you. I always go back to their table with the change and if they tell me to keep it, great! But some people want their change, okay. It doesn't even mean they're not going to tip, it just means that the change isn't the tip.

She also regularly starts clearing tables before all of them are finished. I've walked past tables to find that out of four people on it, only one still has their food. Say we are waiting for the kitchen to send us bread rolls and I've taken an order from a table who are waiting for rolls, I'll always check with everyone that they've not already been out to that table, save me looking like a fool walking around with a bread basket. Her response, every time, is ""I didn't take their order"". First of all, bitch, is that what I fucking asked you? I asked if you gave them bread, I don't care if you took their order or not. Second of all, that's irrelevant. Just because I take a tables order, doesn't mean that I am the sole person responsible for taking their bread out to them. If I see someone has a tables order and I'm not doing anything else, I immediately ask them if they need bread or steak knives and then I go out with it.

She also tries to tell me what to do/how to do things... A lot. I can't tell you how much it pisses me off. She'll go round and adjust tables that I set. She practically throws cutlery down on the tables, her settings are unbelievably messy and knives are often facing the wrong way or knives and forks will be the wrong way round. I'm careful when I set tables, I make them neat and tidy and always double check that everything is where it's meant to be.

When I was 18 I briefly worked at a pub for a Summer between academic years to make some small cash to help supplement the uni life (drinking age in uk is 18 so I was all good to be a server). This was my first and thus far only time working behind a bar, and as such had very little experience pouring from the taps, I wasn't awful, but I'd occasionally have to top up from the tap if I had too much head (foam) on the pint.

About a week into my new gig these two older gents come in, all stormy like, and ask about any 'Premium Lagers'. Now I know jack shit about alcohol, I never liked the taste of it and training was lack luster at best, so I invited the two men to peruse the clearly labelled taps for something they liked the look of; being a people pleaser I tried to give an apologetic smile for my infinite ineptitude. 
I didn't realise at the time but apparently Estrella is a Premium lager, and it was there in all it's labelled glory. Though maybe the men knew as little as me, as they see this and one says in a grumpy voice, scowling the whole time, ""A pub with no premium lagers! This place is surely going to go out of business very soon. I guess I'll just have a Guinness then, but I hope you speak to your manager about your lack of stock!"". (funnily enough this pub had been failing for years before new ownership had taken over and it was becoming a new hub for locals.)
The other orders a Fosters, which for some reason was one of the hardest for me to pour correctly first time, so I do my usual top up to get rid of excess foam when the second bloke goes ""Wow! And a Barmaid that can't even pour a drink properly! This place is awful. I guess we can be grateful that they at least made sure she was pretty"" Before chucking money on the counter and taking a seat. I bought them their drinks once the Guinness had settled, excused myself, got one of the dishwashers in the back to cover me for a moment as I went to the bathroom and shook for a little while.
I'm proud to say I didn't cry, which is a feat for someone as emotional as me.

I didn't serve their table after those comments, the other server had arrived for his shift at that point and covered them after I gave him a quick run down. 
Funnily enough, the same men came in a few weeks later, and I remember internally face palming when the Guinness man saw the Estrella and jovially said ""Ah! I see they did get themselves a Premium Lager, very wise."" And promptly ordered it. They were perfectly amicable and even joked around with me that visit, a complete 180 from their previous disdain towards me.

Had a couple other rude comments about the fact I was female whilst working at that bar, though nothing that quite made my mouth drop open so suddenly.
I guess what stuck with me most about that whole stint at the pub was how understanding and kind some were about the fact I was new and learning the ropes, whilst adversely others were so bitter and twisted that I wasn't some infallible beer dispensing robot.",0,"Hey, at least I'm pretty right?",8

A couple comes in at 12:50am. I am the only front of house worker on, with a full bar and a smattering of tables throughout the dining room. I seat the couple, remind them that we close at 1am. 

There’s no FOH manager or server on, it’s just me. So I’ve been _running_ since midnight to get people food, drinks, refills, my first born child, you name it. 

One am comes and goes and I turn all the lights to max, cut off the music, and turn off all the TVs. I’m still running around helping guests, restocking bar supplies, and server supplies (bc the closer wasn’t thinking**), and getting people’s tabs straightened. 

I run a check over to the couple who decided to sit and eat in the dining room instead of taking it to go. And then they start asking me for all sorts of things. Fine whatever, add it to the list of track and field events I’m competing in this morning. 

I finally get them settled, thank them for coming by, even though I’d rather eat my shorts, and get the doors locked. 

They left me one dollar on a bill where they got a free entre bc of a BOGO special. Cool thanks. That one dollar in addition to my $4.25 hourly really compensated me for the work I did for you specifically.

While most restaurants let employees order discounted food while on break we do something different. Instead we make a free collective meal for everyone, which we call employee meal. As this is a free meal for everyone it will often consist of leftovers, cheap foods like pasta or sandwiches or anything we have access of.

Last Thursday it was my turn to make employee meal and I decided to make veggie burgers. We had a bunch of leftover veggie burgers we use for our Tuesday Burger Night menu. They're my special recipe consisting of edamame beans, spinach and barley, among other ingredients. As a result they are a unique green burger, but they are very well received. 

While we had enough veggie burgers for all the employees I made a few regular burgers as well, because one of the servers that night (we'll call her H) has a soy allergy and can't eat the veggie burger. H has served many burgers nights and knows fully well that she can't have the veggie burgers. I told everyone what we were having for employee meal that night, including H.

I finish making the burgers and put them out for everyone to eat. H eventually saw the burgers, grabbed one and started eating. Next thing you know she starts spitting out her food and freaking out. 

H: ""Are these veggie burgers!?"" 

Me: ""Yeah, why didn't you grab a regular burger?""

H: ""How was I supposed to know!?""

Me: ""You couldn't tell your burger was green?""

I work in a chain pub/restaurant, and have been here nearly a year. I have a few stories, but this one is by far the most ridiculous.
We have a few ""gambling machines/fruit machines"", which is what it says on the tin really, and where I live you have to be 18 to use them. This means that any kids under the age of 18 are not even allowed to touch the machines let alone play on them - this follows the same principle as gambling shops, where anyone under 18 isn't allowed to go into the shops. 
Because of how brightly coloured the machines are, I often have to tell kids that they're not allowed to play on the machines, usually met with some confused parents, not understanding why when they're not using money, but they usually just leave it and move on. Not this lady.

I was heading out back to grab some ice for the bar, and I noticed 5 kids alone, bashing on the machines and stuff, and as I'd just come back off my break, I didn't know who the parents were. So I crouched down and said as gently as I could, they were very young, that they weren't allowed to play on the machines. They stared at me blankly then ran off. Job done, right? Wrong!
After getting ice I come back and see these kids at the bar with their mum(Rude Lady), and overhear them saying to one of my co-workers that someone had been shouting at her kids for playing with the machines. I'm not about to let someone else take s*** on my behalf, so I step in and say it was me, and quickly establish that I did not shout at the kids, and I asked them gently. RL was not having any of it. She starts shouting at me telling me that she'd already had issues with staff, and that she would take this higher. I apologised to her for that, but again said I didn't shout at her kids. Conversation sort of goes like this (it's a bit fuzzy, but I'll paraphrase it because it was a painful conversation)

Me: Ma'am I didn't shout at your kids, I just told them the machines were for adults

RL: NO! You shouted at my poor kids and now she's crying because of it! They didn't even have any money?

Me: I understand, but the law means that-

RL: No you don't understand! They weren't doing anything wrong! They didn't have any money, and the machines are brightly coloured so of course they'll want to play!

Me: The machines are designed that way so that they seem attractive and people will want to play, but the law says they're not allowed to play with them. Also they're prone to breaking and the kids were hitting the buttons, and I didn't want it to break

RL: I don't care, they weren't doing anything wrong, you just shouted at my kids! If there was an issue you should have come to the parents!!

Me: The kids were by themselves, I didn't know who the parents were?

RL: We were literally just round the corner!

Me: Well then you would have heard me if I shouted at them, which I didn't.

RL: Well my kids told me you shouted at them! My two year old is now crying because she has anxiety

Me: (Someone who has been on antidepressants for a year and has severe anxiety) I'm very sorry to hear that but I wasn't harsh to them

RL: No! You were abusing my kids! Just because you don't like kids you treated them like dirt! Now I have to go home and try to help her cope with her anxiety because YOU abused my kids! 

Me: Ma'am please calm down, I'm just-

RL:(TRIGGERED - She then mocks my voice) ""ma'am please calm down"", no how dare you abuse my kids! Don't ever touch my kids or shout at them, do you understand me?

Me: Yes b-

RL: do you understand?

(This repeats until I eventually give up)

RL: I'm going to post your name and this pub all over the internet and tell them that you're a child abuser, and that you attacked my kids! I have your name, I can end your life, my post will go viral, and everyone will know that you abuse children!!!

By this point my manager stepped in and I went and had a panic attack in the back. Her and her friend did leave a negative review each on Facebook, but luckily they forgot my name. And some of the stuff they wrote was utter rubbish. Turned out, my manager gave them a free bottle of prosecco to apologise, which they didn't mention, but that made me angry. They caused me to have a panic attack and cry, and threatened to ruin my life, and got a free bottle of prosecco for it? Brilliant. 
To this day I'm terrified to ask kids to stop playing with the machines, because I never know how the parents will react. Some people are just so arrogant.

I loved my coworkers and believed in the quality of food. However, my last 6 months became an extremely toxic environment. I was doing things to help management without proper compensation, and was working 12-14 hour shifts almost every day just to try to keep the restaurant running. We had stupid problems like apathetic BOH employees that were unorganized and wouldn’t remake burned/wrong food, and things like having a full service bar but only 9 wine glasses for the whole restaurant during BUSY season because no one bothered to order more (I did not have the “authority” to do so even though I constantly begged the management and owners). It became too much and on my last shift I clocked in as a server but had to work hosting and bussing for 4 hours without taking tables because no one scheduled anyone to do those jobs. This was New Year’s Eve. (I also live in a touristy area).


I started a new job where I’m making twice as much money and not having to wear myself thin mentally and physically. It’s still hard work, but BOH and FOH genuinely run as a team. The kitchen is always prompt with tickets, we have enough supplies, and the management has my back. 

I was so scared to leave for a long time because I wanted the other restaurant to succeed and I had regulars I adored, but my mental health was suffering. I finally had to say goodbye and it was well worth it. Just wanted to tell my story in case anyone sees this and it encourages them to make a positive change for themselves. If your management is treating you like shit or your job is keeping you up at night, you deserve better. Go find it. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a server in a fancier restaurant near a lake, that's under the gastronomy branch of a large company in my country. Every year our city hosts a week long festival, that is themed about a certain book/movie character. The festival is mainly meant for children, so there are alot of kids from different schools from all over the country there during that week. Last year the festival was hosted by the lake, so we got a lot of reservations from those schools so the kids could eat lunch there.

&amp;#x200B;

I was working in the morning and through lunch one day, when we had three schools during lunch. We already had the lunches prepared by the time they came and quickly served them, but while serving them, two teachers from one school came up to my boss and told him that not every child is going to eat lunch. My boss asked them why, and they replied that some parents couldn't pay for their childs lunch, so they had sandwiches with them that they brought from home. To say the least, my boss was shocked and refused to not serve those few kids. He insisted that our company will cover the costs.

&amp;#x200B;

The teachers said that they appreciated the offer, but would rather not take him up on it, because, and I quote: ""The parents that did pay for the lunches will be offended that the children will have theirs covered, and we'd rather not deal with that.""

&amp;#x200B;

My boss kindly and more politely told them to get fucked and that he won't let those kids watch their classmates eat a hot plate of chicken nuggets, while they had to eat a small sandwich. In the end ALL the kids got a plate of chicken nuggets, a juice box and a cup of ice cream.

I was on bar around the holidays, so it was pretty busy but manageable. A lady who was visiting from out of town came up with her husband and friend and the latter two ordered an IPA and a rum and coke. The lady wasnt really sure what she wanted, so she asked me what kind of drinks I liked, and to just make her something simple and cheap, but to surprise her. I made a vodka pineapple, which tastes similar to a screwdriver but is tastier in my opinion, and no one hardly ever orders them. I made the drinks and her husband and friend left to go find seats while she started a tab.

She tasted the drink and was really impressed by it! She said it was a combination she'd never thought to try before but that it was really good! This made me super happy and I'm glad I was able to introduce her to a new drink. They came back for a couple more rounds throughout the night, and she got vodka pineapples the whole time.

I'm working at a large restaurant that most days has large parties booked (anywhere from 20-100 ppl). There is a second floor with its own bar so it's just a matter of putting them up there and doing cash bar/tabs. 

My issue stems from the fact that there is no minimum spend, no room fee, no auto-grat, etc. In my city it's suuuuper weird to have none of these things. We have no shows very frequently meaning a server has their section empty for an hour.

For example, today there was a party for 40 people booked. There were other larger parties in tonight so this 40 had to be put in my section. Only 20 people ended up showing up, they ordered max $100 in food (just some platters, like nachos, to share). Half of them had 1-2 beers, and the other half were water &amp; pop. They took up my entire section from 7pm to 10pm. The entire dinner rush.

So quick setup: it's a pub with open seating. There are 2 signs that indicate this. Of course that's not enough and the staff always make a point to tell anyone by the door that it's open seating and they can sit where they like. The bar is long, with a back patio (accessed by walking through the entire restaurant). Bar is the first thing you see upon entering.


Story time. Today an older lady(OL) (60ish) walks in. Cue the server(S) to greet and inform her of open seating.


S: good afternoon! Feel free to sit where you like; it's open seating

OL: ok there will be 5 of us today

S: ok, well it's open seating so you're welcome to pick whatever table is open. 

S walks away.

OL just stands there and leans against the POS station for a couple minutes before the bartender (BT) comes over. BT saw the initial greeting but did not hear the conversation. Their convo:

BT: hi! Are you waiting for a to-go order?

OL: have I been seated?! No I haven't. 

BT: oh, well it's all open seating. You can sit wherever you'd like. 

OL: I'm meeting people on the back patio

BT: the back patio is closed (note: it hasn't been open for summer yet since it snowed 2 days ago)

OL: *begins to meander through bar before settling on a larger table towards the back, right by expo*
OL's other 4 friends show up. At this point the kitchen had a delivery and they were starting to portion out and tenderize chicken. 
OL flags down 1S:

OL: Excuse me, what are they pounding back there?!

S: oh I think they're just tenderizing chicken right now

OL: Well can you tell them to stop? Its disturbing our lunch.

S: *laughs* (assuming it's a joke)

Summer is our busy time as we’re right on the lake. We’re only open for breakfast and lunch. During the week we only have 1 server right now. On the weekends we have 2 sometimes 3.  We always just rotate turns when people come in. There’s an older lady I work with, well call her Samantha. She’s worked there significantly longer than me. When I first started there, she gave me a hard time about a lot of things and would sometimes try to sneak and take the bigger tables even if it was my turn. For the past few months though, we have been getting along really well and she actually has respect for me now, because she can see I’m a hard worker.

Fast forward to today, everything was going good, but it was kind of a slow day. 120 people in total. We had 2 tables come in, a 2 top, and a single guy. I took my 2 top as it was my turn, and she took the single guy. Then a 5 top came in, and I sat them down and said I’ll be right back to get your drinks. When I came back she was already getting the drinks. I told her it was mine and she said no the last 2 came in at the same time. I argued with her. And she said I could have the 5 top. But she already got the drinks, so I just said screw it. Go ahead and get them. I was basically mad at her for the rest of the day. She threw off the rotation and then ended up getting all the bigger tables after that which would’ve been mine. 

I was honestly more hurt than anything. Because she always has tried to steal bigger tables, but since were kind of friends now I thought that was over with. What should I say or do to actually make her stop. 

Oh and a side note, the owners are an older couple who are never there. And we have a “manager” but she only works in the kitchen. And really all she does is schedule people and do the order.

A mother and her daughter come in and I take their drink orders. They each order a sangria and I ask for the daughter’s ID since she looks very young and possibly under 21. I don’t ID the mom since she very obviously looks over 40. Probably more in the 50s range. The daughter says she doesn’t have her ID with her. I say I’m sorry and offer any other non-alcoholic drinks or even a mock tail. She decides to just stick with water and is very modest about it.

Then the mom says right in front of me, “you can just try some of my sangria” and then looks up at me and asks, “is that okay?” 

I was so dumbfounded, like I couldn’t believe she actually asked me that. I say, “um no actually it’s not.” I ended up just letting the mom have her sangria but I feel like I would’ve been able to refuse sale to both of them since she made that comment. I was also scared that it could’ve been some sting operation from the liquor board.

I work at a mom and pop restaurant and bar where the ""mom and pop"" owners also work as servers and cook as well.  We have an electronic pull tab system, a couple of ipads, that people can gamble on.  It's a small part of what we do, but every morning and every night whoever opens or closes has to count out the money that is in the box.  Well, the gambling manager came in for his monthly count and it turns out that the box was about $40 short of what it was supposed to equal out to.  In the grand scheme of things there have been at least 6 sets of hands in this box putting money in and taking it out.  So the owner gets the bright idea to deter any future miscounting or possible theft (not the case here) by making all the servers pay $6.50 a piece to make up for any lost money.

I know, I know, $6.50 doesn't seem like a big deal, and the other servers don't really seem to care that much, but they're mostly young and inexperienced or they're an old friend and employee of the owners.  Then there's me.  I'm pretty sure that this is at the very least an immorally paranoid attempt at collective punishment.  At the most, it may be just plain illegal.  Say down the line, someone does steal a couple hundred dollars out of the box, the precedent would be set that the servers would have to pay for it.

Does anyone know or have any sources about the legality for situations like this?  As of right now, I'm the only one refusing to pay into the ""lost"" fund, but if I'm being paranoid let me know.  It's just that none of this seems right, especially when the owner likened this to making servers pay for the tabs on walk-outs.

&amp;#x200B;

Our restaurant does till service rather than table service (used to do table service months ago), so that means that we get the guests seated, tell them their table number (while pointing at a little wooden block that has the number on the end of the table), and tell them to pop on to the tills to order. When it's busy there can be a very loooooong line (up to 15 people) and people tend to get agitated and short of patience, which I completely understand as I'd be a bit annoyed as well!! Doesn't help that we have 3 tills present, of which only 2 work, and that we generally only have enough staff on hand to have 1 open!! So I notice that the line is stupidly long and offer to jump on the second till - my supervisor tells me to go for it (she's on the other till next to it) but says that it only works with card (brilliant). I log on and shout out if anybody is paying by card. No one reacts, and I ask again to make sure, intently looking at each of their faces to see any possible reaction. One server tells me that nobody is paying by card as she went through the line asking. So I go back to bussing tables/seating people/serving food for no more than 5 minutes until a group who is in line stops me dead in my tracks. Meet the cast: it's a middle-aged lady and her friend (ML) and one older gentleman in front of them (OG) relatively in the middle of the line. I assumed they were all on the same table because they were all talking to me at the same time and they were talking amongst each other. At first I have problems understanding what they are trying to tell me and I ask them to clarify as I am having problems understanding the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

ML: \*visibly annoyed\* I am asking WHY the line is so long. WHY do you not have more tills open? It's totally unacceptable to make people queue like this to order their food!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm so sorry. Are you paying by card? I can open the other till for you.

&amp;#x200B;

ML: Well that would be about time because I've been waiting here for ten damn minutes!

&amp;#x200B;

???? She cannot have been in line when I called because she'd have heard me/my colleague would have talked to her, so she must have literally joined the line a few moments ago and lies about waiting for so long. Why do people lie???? Why are you dramatic like this trying to make me feel bad for you and acting like I'm a shitty server who doesn't pay attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm ever so sorry. I \*did\* call out about five minutes ago if anybody was paying with their card - I must not have heard you. As I said, I'm more than happy to open the till if you're--

&amp;#x200B;

OG: \*had been trying to interrupt several times already\* I'm paying by card as well! (he continued talking, being very upset, and I could not understand him because of how agitated he was. He was talking fast and stuttering and I just nodded apologising)

&amp;#x200B;

I rush to the till, log on and call out very clearly, ""For those paying by card, please come forward!"" ML and her friend come to my till. Immediately ML continues:

&amp;#x200B;

ML: \*Between her teeth\* The service here changed and it's not for the best. I know it's not your fault but this is awful, just awful. I won't ever come back here.

&amp;#x200B;

We get to the order and once we get to paying she whips out her card and I push the button to activate the card reader which offers the possibility to add a gratuity for the service (it never used to do this and was reset a few days before, which I was unaware of). ML almost looses it and spits out OH NO CHANCE IN HELL and shoves her finger on the refuse button. After she pays she asks for a number she can call so she can give some feedback. I hand her our feedback card she leaves with her friend. OG walks up.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi! You are paying by card right?

&amp;#x200B;

OG: \*immediately starts rambling at me with a raised voice about how he had been in front ML and I just let them shove themselves past him and how YES HE IS PAYING BY CARD STOP ASKING ALREADY\*

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason why I didn't say anything was because I legitimately thought they were on the same table. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Uh- Okay- I'm so sorry-

&amp;#x200B;

OG: \*continues to ramble about the shitty service I am giving him\*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Right, again, I am so sorry. What is your table number?

&amp;#x200B;

OG: \*slams the wooden block on the counter\* That's my table number!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: \*trying to keep calm\* Right okay table 9. What can I get for you?

&amp;#x200B;

OG: An apple juice and a root beer. \*intermittently slamming the counter with the cube\*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: We don't have any apple juice I am afraid. \[Supervisor\], have we got any root beers left?

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor: No, delivery comes in tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: We're so sorry, we don't have any root beer either.

&amp;#x200B;

OG: \*looses shit, slams cube and shouts\* So you don't have apple juice OR root beer. That's it. Goodbye! \*slams cube one last time, leaves it and storms back to his table\*

&amp;#x200B;

Me and Supervisor: Bye bye :)

&amp;#x200B;

As there is nobody left in line, I take the cube and walk to his table. I gently place is back on his table while he's putting on his coat and orders his wife around to do the same so they can leave.

&amp;#x200B;

OG: THERE IS NOTHING ON THE MENU HERE! NO DRINKS! NO SERVICE!

&amp;#x200B;

I just smile at him and walk away from this mess and get back to my work.

I was a bit shaken by the whole affair because I could not (still cannot) understand for the life of me why these two thought it was okay to be so aggressive and dramatic and direct it all at me. While the post looks like it took half an hour, the whole situation lasted probably about 8 to 10 minutes in total. These people literally talked for a total of 8 minutes to me and managed to spit out so much venom and anger that it left me completely baffled. I also dislike the service system in my restaurant but honestly if you hate it this much... By all means leave a feedback note to the head office and vent to your friends and leave, but don't behave yourself like that towards people who have no choice but do as the system says. I go out of my way all of the time to jump into action so no one has to wait for too long but that is still not enough for other people who think that because they are a guest I must bow down to them and accept the abuse they throw at my face. While ML was just being passive-aggressive and bitchy, OG was so aggressive that I should have flat-out refused to serve him and tell him we would call security if he continued trying to intimidate me by slamming the counter with the cube (it was very loud. other customers were turning and looking).

I was on closing duty, and had to help closing the kitchen before I could do my regular closing duties. We closed at 2 AM at weekends due to the drive through, so around 2.30 AM the kitchen was finished, and around 3:15AM I finished and wanted to lock up the office with the safe and set the alarm for that area so the cleaners could finish cleaning the office. It failed and the alarm went off. The security company called and I explained what happend.

This is considered a security issue, because the parking place was dark and by threatening me, they could force me to open the doors and the safe.

We were asked to turn on the ordering system for the drive, and stay away from the windows. I took the cleaners into the office, took a dive headset and we watched the security monitors. Within 5 minutes, 3 police cars with blue lights flashing entered our parking place from all 3 separate entrances. They blocked the suspicious car from leaving, and even bought a police dog, as I heard it barking over my headset.

On the monitor, I saw them approaching the car carefully, and after a few moments, a man came out of the car. They send in the dog to search the car. After a few minutes, they moved the police cars and the man quickly left the parking lot. An officer came to the drive order speaker and said laughingly ""Thanks for calling us in, but it's ok.

She has a drink and is waiting on her food. She turns around to me and says an the most obnoxious tone: “Where is my server?? I NEED MY BREAD NOW!!” And she literally was banging her fists on the table. I politely said “Well what does she look like ma’am? I can go get her for you and bring your bread out.” She replies “Well I don’t know!! Just get me my bread!!” 
Now at our restaurant we don’t serve bread before meals, only salads and soups (if ordered). So in order to get bread out beforehand, you just need to let the server know. I go back to the kitchen almost bust out laughing because this 70-80 year old woman is having a tantrum like a 4 year old. 
Her server is setting up her food in the window (it’s ready) and I let her know what happened.
Server: “What? She never asked for bread before the meal.”
This makes the lady even crazier because she was acting like she asked and the server forgot. Now she’s just crazy.
She later on sends back her fries because they were “cold” even tho her food went out fresh and never sat in the window for longer than a minute. 
I went back to cleaning and the lady gets up, and says to herself “I don’t have time for this!” As if waiting for fresh hot fries wasn’t gonna take more time 😐
She then walks out.
I saw her the next day at Walmart before I went to work and she was CRAZY for real. She was shopping in the women’s section, but kept bumping her cart into shelves and was yelling out loud saying things like “Wtf? I can’t deal with this. WTF??” 
She ends up coming back THAT NIGHT and she gets put in the same server’s section again.
The server doesn’t want to go out there so someone else takes her. The old lady then notices her server from the previous night (she had to clean her section which was next to the lady), says “Oh great it’s that stupid waitress again!!” And walks out.",0,I NEED MY BREAD,43

I've posted a little about my job before. I work at a small local pub in Ireland as a server. All together we have 117 tables. I work from Tuesday to Friday alone.

I've had tables walk out on me before and I have to cover the bill. 
Something else that bothers me is that we close the kitchen at 8:45 so people can order until 8:44. But the manager of the pub always let's people order at 8:55 or 9. Meaning I don't get to finish at 9 like I'm supposed to.

So I manage a busy restaurant in central London. We are normally fully booked weeks in advance even for Monday’s. This was a Thursday and we were jam packed. I was walking around making sure everyone was having a good time and one of my waiters (super nice, and a competent guy)  comes and asks me to take one of his tables. I have a policy that if anyone is giving my team a hard time I’ll take the table so they can stay at top of there game. 
He gives me a quick heads up that the issue is a woman didn’t want to wait longer for her food despite having a severe nut allergy and she was calling him stupid and saying stuff like maybe McDonald’s would be a better fit for you. I go over and talk to the lady, she is part of a group of 12 and right away she’s already in my bad books. “Are you someone with a brain?” I look at her and laugh awkwardly and tell her “some people would argue but I think so, my colleague tells me than an issue with your order”  “yes, I have a severe nut allergy and he was saying things may contain traces and would take slightly longer, and asking dumb stuff like are traces ok?” I try to explain to her as nicely as I could, “ow ok, he asked about traces to know if we can use the food that is already preped, for a severe allergy we can’t use any of the ingredients that were preped as there could be cross contamination, so what we would have to do is clean down a separate area, and prepare everything from scratch. But of course we can time everything to come out at once so you can all enjoy your food together. And as for the may contain trace, that’s just because we don’t make all our sauces ourself and some items are preped in a central kitchen where we can’t control that being said we have never had a problem with an allergy.” 
She looks at me as though I just slapped a baby in front of her and says “so you are stupid too, is it so hard deal with an allergy, our company is spending a lot of money here and We booked 6 weeks ago. A restaurant like this shouldn’t be so stressful can you just make me my food without nuts and if I have a reaction I’ll sue.” 
That’s when I thought she’s right...

So I told her “you are right, I’m sorry, we can’t serve you. The sauces can’t be made from scratch and because you are unwilling to accept a risk that’s comparable to the risk you would take when buying anything packaged anywhere, that says “may contain nuts” just to cover themselves legally, I’m going to have say we can not safely serve you.”
To this day when I think about her face, I smile. She was in shock. 
She immediately asked to speak to my manager but was out of luck, I told her I was the general manager. Her friends didn’t seem to care, I think it was a work thing because none of them reacted. But I was feeling petty since she insulted my team member and then me. So I addressed the whole table and said “I’m really sorry about this and I wish we had known in advance so we could have prepared for such a severe allergy, I really don’t want this sour your evening so I would like to offer everyone a cocktail on us to apologise. They were all really happy with this gesture. I take all the drink orders and before allergy lady orders her cocktail I tell her, “by the way, we have almond syrup and nuts in the bar so I would only feel comfortable giving you something closed like a bottle of beer or a glass of wine.” 

It cost me over £250 to give away the round of drinks but felt so good to give her a bit of karma.

First time posting forgive me

I work at a taco fusion place in a pretty busy part of my city, but that day when I walked in for my night shift it was completely dead except for one table of seven. The morning server handed them off to me and I could tell he was just done, he explained that they had returned a burrito twice and had a few complaints about the food and were being very difficult to please. 

Our kitchen manager who I’ll call “Chris” was being very hands on with the table since no other customers were in the restaurant, so I spoke to him before greeting the table and he seemed to be almost laughing. He told me there was no point expecting a tip from them because they were just trying to get their meals comped and pay as little as they could. 

It’s kind of fun to deal with difficult tables (gives us all some gossip) so I went up to them and refilled their drinks and asked if there was anything else I could get them before I brought the checks out. As soon as I brought up their bill a woman at the table takes a huge swing of her beer and says “I think after all we’ve been through today I shouldn’t have to pay for my drinks”. I’m trying not to roll my eyes as I tell her that won’t be possible since it is illegal to comp alcoholic beverages in our state. She waves for Chris who is watching from across the room laughing 

I let Chris deal with the rest of the interaction. He gives them the bills for their drinks and walks them out the front door laughing and being so polite. I have no idea how he could keep everything so professional knowing how much food they wasted. 

I’m busing their table and not a single tip on any of their bills (no way). Chris comes back in beaming, holds out his hand and says,”they wanted you to have this” and hands me a rock. It’s not a pretty rock, it’s like a rock you would find in your driveway. I said “we tip share, how are we gonna split this up?”

181,Loaochoa,0,t3_bk784f,4,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bk784f/got_in_trouble_at_work_because_managers_friend/,"I worked at a café last summer, i was fairly new and was still learning how some of the stuff worked, this was in a very popular tourist site so there was a line all the way out on the street to the cafe. For context we were five employees behind the desk and there were two cash registers which means the line split in two, so there were 2 girls taking orders and handling payments and 3 girls making the orders. 

I was making coffee, i had a list of i think 6 or 7 orders of different coffee, so maybe two espressos, one cappuchino, one mocha latte, etc you get what i mean, so it was taking some time and customers were waiting. My coworker that was at the cash register was serving this customer and went in the back to grab something for said customer. 

While she was away this lady (the customer, lets call her karen) calls me over and tells me she wants a sandwich but she wants me to remove something from the sandwich (dont remember exactly) 

Now this particular bakery was known for their sandwiches and there were a LOT of options and i wasnt sure what was in each sandwich since we were expected to just ask the manager if we were unsure and this was my second week working there so i didnt know wich sandwich was wich. 

So anyways i tell her im not sure what sandwich she was talking about and that i was going to get the manager to ask her, (mind you the coffee orders are still waiting and im getting very stressed) 

but no instead of waiting for me to get the manager this bitch karen starts yelling at me and is soo rude like “what, you dont know anything about these sandwiches?, dont you work here?, its not hard just remove (whatever vegetable she wanted removed) and heat my sandwich.

 I explained to her the removing of the vegetable was not the issue but that i was simply confused and was going to ask for help. She still continued being rude and my manager happened to walk by, i ask manager which sandwich it is that karen is talking about, she shows me, problem solved. 

But NO karen tells me to open the sandwich, remove the vegetable or whatever and scrape off the butter and replace it with garlic butter (mind you the coffee orders are still waiting, line is getting longer and other customers getting annoyed so i tell one of my coworkers if she can help karen with the sandwich while i finish the coffee) karen hears that and says, what?,you dont know how to scrape butter off a damn sandwich? 

I explain to her that i had orders to finish and that there was already a girl that was taking her order before she started telling me to do it. That coworker comes back and goes, yea you just take her order, i tell her i already had orders and that bitch started getting rude to me too so i just fix karens fucking sandwitch and hand it to her. Karen goes: are you dumb?, you were supposed to heat it for me?? 

I explain to her that we have a sandwich grill in the big room where the tables are and if customers want their sandwich heated they can do that over there since we didnt have a grill or microwave behind the counter (i later found out she comes here very often and therefore im pretty sure she knows about that damn sandwich grill). 

She starts yelling at me to do it for her and made me take the sandwich to the dining room and heat it  while she was watching me, she was very rude and then when i said, okay the price is “whatever the price was” she goes, nah i know the manager im just gonna go. 

Now since this bakery is a small family buisness there are lots of people that come in and get free stuff because they know the owners, but we always have to verify with the manager or owner before we let the customer leave without paying to prevent people from lying go get free food. 

Karen scoffs and says “you really dont know who i am?” Im like no? And she leaves rudely without saying anything (i inform my manager and turns out karen did know the owner, so at least she wasnt stealing). 

I now proceed to continue those fucking coffee orders when my manager starts yelling at me that people were waiting for their orders and yada yada yada, i explained the karen situation to her and she goes, well you could have asked someone else to do the coffee (wich by the way i forgot to mention i had asked the bitch ass coworker that was supposed to take karens orders to take care of the coffees for me  but she just made two plain black coffees (so not the coffee that was ordered) and nothing else) 

I ended up getting yelled at and then had to go back to work. After my shift i started telling my friend who also worked there and she goes, oh yea that lady is the owner of “some other popular restaurant in town”, she always acts like that so no one likes taking her orders. 

Ps: sorry for bad english, it is not my first language. Yall can point out my grammar mistakes tho so i know what i need to work on.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you want more stories from this particular café because boy do i have LOTS of them.

So I’m like ma’m did you go on our website or did you go on google because google doesn’t have the correct pricing. And she was all like it says it’s 25.99 online you have to accommodate and cater to that dont you. So I was just like “may I place you on hold for a moment” and she was like ok sure. So I place her on hold and had my manager answer the call instead. He basically told her the same exact thing and she wouldn’t accept that answer and kept trying to get him to make it cheaper. But he wouldn’t budge and just told her that google doesn’t set our prices. So she hangs up unhapy with the answer. Maybe 10 minutes later she calls again and places the order for 2 of the $28.99 ribeye steak with 1 side each plus a side salad. So her check ended up being $66+ after tax.

This makes shoe shopping for me really exhausting and time consuming. I’m willing to buy anything comfortable. but my work has specifications for our shoes so I can’t buy just any old thing. 

My last work shoes were starting to look sad, so I knew it was time. Last week I spent 4 hours going to a bunch of shoe stores before I found something. I thought they were great but I’ve been wearing them for a week and my feet and calves are really sore even right now sitting on the couch. I’ve been trying to power through but I usually switch to my old ragged amazingly comfortable shoes around 5 hours into my shift.  I thought they would improve with some breaking in and I also added insoles but they hurt and it sucks. 

So, I guess I have to go stupid shoe shopping again tomorrow on my day off when I really just want to rest my sore feet.  It’s really hard for me to be nice to strangers when my feet are aching. 

I wish that someone would just manufacture a decent looking, polishable, cosy as $&amp;@! black shoe that I can wear with a skirt or pants that I could just buy over and over again. Every time I find something great I try to go back to where I bought them to clean them out and squirrel them away and they’re always all gone.

Edit: Thanks for your great suggestions, everyone.

I was working in a pub with a beer garden that was a total sun trap. Now, this is in the UK, so the likelihood of any sun being trapped there was reduced to about four days out of the year. 
This was one such day. It was a Saturday afternoon and the sort of day that makes every server with outdoor seating at their establishment groan at the sight of. 


That afternoon the pub inside was empty, so people could be forgiven for thinking we weren’t busy. But the garden was packed. Every table taken. Every available bit of sunshine was being bathed in. People were lounging on the walls and on the stairs up to the garden, waiting for a table. 


Enter, the Idiot Woman (IW) and her embarrassed daughter. 


So. It being Saturday at about 3pm, everyone’s having food and drink, and we as bar staff are constantly running food and clearing plates and glasses up the ricketiest stairs you can imagine.


IW stopped me on one such clearing mission, when I had plates and glasses balanced precariously, to let me know; ‘Excuse me, your garden is full’ 


Me: ‘Sorry madam, yes our outdoor section is a bit full today, you’re welcome to sit in any of the tables inside’ 


IW: ‘but we want to sit outside’ 


She sort of looked expectantly at me, for FAR too long. I don’t know what she thought would happen. That I would lay down the plates I was carrying and crap out a two top of patio furniture for her and the poor lass behind her? She might have to give me some privacy. 


Me: ‘it’s a lovely day I know, but it is a Saturday afternoon and we do get busy around this time, you’re welcome to wait but I can’t tell you how long people will be’ 


IW: ‘there are people just drinking out there, can you tell them to move so we can sit down?’ 


After explaining that we were a pub, that we don’t do reserved seating, we don’t seat people, and people can sit at the tables having just drinks if they like, she continued on this thread for a while, and we had a back and forth of her getting increasingly irate and whiny that I couldn’t accommodate her in our beer garden. On a Saturday afternoon. In the sun. On literally our busiest day since Christmas. 


I don’t know what was worse. The way she’d stopped me mid clear, so that my arms were shaking from the combined weight of the plates and her stupidity; that we were having this conversation amongst perfectly serviceable tables who’s only crime were being inside; or the face on her daughter behind her, the crushing realisation that her mom was ensuring she would always be too embarrassed to come back without the idiot baggage. 


In the end, I dropped the customer service act.


Me: ‘look, it’s Saturday, and pretty much the first sunny day we’ve had in months. Yes, our garden is full. No, I will not kick people out for you. If you’re that hungry, eat indoors. If not, go elsewhere, but I promise you it’s the same story across the city. Your lack of planning is not my problem, I have to keep doing my job.’

185,Imiyaki,0,t3_bk1zgc,11,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bk1zgc/customer_waits_an_hour_for_food_and_then_refuses/,"So last night I had a customer order and sit down with his Wife, and the wife was lovely, very talkative and vibrant, and the husband in contrast was very quiet and seemed almost moody. I was weary when talking with him, thinking he might be a difficult customer, but I smiled and talked pretty and said their food shouldn’t be too long. 

Well, after a miscommunication with me and the kitchen, their food was going to take a half hour to cook, instead of the usual 10 minutes due to running out of cooked product. (I was under the assumption we had enough for their order but apparently not) so I didn’t inform them of the extra wait. 

Time passes. They are waiting. And their food hasn’t arrived. At about the 20~25 minute mark, the husband gets up and asks where his food is. 

And that’s when I realized, I didn’t inform him of the wait! I apologized profusely and rushed back to get an accurate wait time on the order, and it was ten more minutes. Ok I can work with that. 

So I tell him the wait is just ten more minutes, again apologize for the wait, and that I’ll bring the food out as soon as possible. he says ok, and sits back down to tell his wife what’s going on. 

While he’s doing that, I go to my manager and ask what can I give them to apologize for the wait? Well my manager says we are giving them half a chicken free! Very generous, and I go over to their table and inform them of my managers plan and hope they are ok with it?

Nope. The husband is nodding, appearing to like the idea, but the WIFE says no! Saying they already have a whole chicken so they don’t need a half!

I freak, on no!  They are *really mad*. I scramble to think of something else we can offer them without breaking too many policies(the fact they where offered a half chicken was *already* against policy) and then, lightbulb!

We had a promotion going on, a cheap meal deal that offered a voucher, for a free side the next time the customer came back in! (It’s supposed to be one per customer/order, but no one follows that rule at all)

So I asked if she would like some free vouchers instead? 

BINGO WE HAVE A WINNER

She smiled and said sure! So I got her about 6 vouchers and explained how they work, and by then their food was all ready! Score!

They seem happy with their food, and my manager even throws in an extra side of chips for free too!(which they didn’t end up eating, but fairs fair)

AND THEN! Oh there’s more! THEN my manager turns around and says to me: offer them a few free drinks. 

FREE DRINKS AS WELL? Damn Manager was pulling all the stops out!

So I offer them any drink on our menu. You know what they got? One coke. ONE. I offered them two and they only got ONE!! 

And it was kinda close to closing time when they were almost done with their food,(they were the last customers of the night) so I chatted with them while I was wiping down tables and sweeping the floors, and they started rushing to get out so I could close properly! I assured them to take their time, we aren’t officially closed for another 15 min or so, and I’m just getting ahead in my closing duties so they should really stay and enjoy their meal properly. 

They ended up leaving soon after (a shame, I was enjoying the conversation, and the husband was just shy! Not rude or standoffish like I had originally thought, so bonus!) and didn’t end up finishing the food  they had ordered! So I got them a take away box and off they went!

Really very nice people. Looking back on it, I can see they were never actually upset by the wait, you know? I just freaked that they had been waiting so long and didn’t want the situation to turn volatile like it almost always does. 

I wish more customers would be understanding like they were, and I’m sure it helped that we basically offered them a free meal on top of their order, but still. 

(Fun fact! When the husband asked where their food was, and I went back to check, my manager asked if I was crying again, bc the *last* time a customer was waiting for that long, she turned into a Horrid B. And made me cry. So that was a bit funny)",0,"Customer waits an hour for food, and then refuses our compensation.",32

I get sat with an old lady and when I ask what she wants, she says “All I want are blueberry pancakes and fried catfish.” 
Now on our menu, we have blueberry pancakes by itself (3) but to get the catfish she’d have to order it separately because there’s nothing on our menu that matches what she specifically wants. I tell her that she can have the blueberry pancakes, as it’s there on the menu, but she’ll need to order just the catfish separately (she didn’t want sides). The thing I hate about our place is if someone gets a meat by itself, it costs like $7-8. We’re kind of a pricy restaurant so to get catfish WITH sides is only $3 more. 
She didn’t want to do this.
“Why don’t you have anything on the menu with just pancakes and catfish??” 
At this point I’m getting aggravated because literally no restaurant has specific dishes like that. All of our pancake breakfast meals come with eggs and bacon or something.
She asked how much it’d cost for the pancakes and then the catfish separately, and I told her about $15. 
She gets pissed and says “Well I don’t want to spend anything near $20!”
Lady, you chose to come here well aware of how expensive our food can be. Literally an entree is always at least $10. (Yelling in my head)

This happened Sunday morning. I work at a smallish biergarden run fast-casual. You can sit at the bar (full service), start a tab at the bar,  or simply order at the front register and take a table number. Normally in the past, I would be working Sunday morning bar,  but things ate changing and I'm transitioning to management, so I'm covering FOH duties,  which includes helping the food runners so I can talk to tables and maintain the floor. So I spend alot of time at the kitchen window which is at one end of the bar. Now for the fun stuff, it started without me briefly but this is what happens.....

IA: (walks up to bar top) I'll have the red frozen drink

BT: Ok. (pours drink and sets in front of guest)

IA: (peers into glass) Are those seeds? Is there strawberry in this???

BT: Yes ma'am.

I had sent out about 5 resumes prior to changing up my resume, and then sent out a bunch of fudged resumes. Surprisingly, the nicest, priciest restaurant of all the places I applied to got back to me a month later. They were one of the five places that got my real, unfudged resume.  I went in for an interview and talked up my food knowledge and my sales experience from doing freelance work and they immediately set up a stage for that friday. I went in, tried to be helpful by doing some grunt work, soaked up some information, and then was told to go home and come back monday. Well they hired me on full time and now I'm working at one of the nicest spots in town with absolutely no serving experience. They're also training me on the bar.

I'm a hostess and this will be my 8th shift, but I won't have support from more experienced hosts and will be taking on this shift with two other new people  who aren't picking up things as quickly as I did. I'm going to need to delegate almost everything to them as they aren't able to run the show themselves. I'm fairly new to this restaurant and it's unlike my previous jobs. While I've worked in fine dining for the last 5 years, this place is very different. It's a very New Money, high-end steak house. Reservations for the weekends fill up around 3 to 4 weeks in advance. It's a very hot spot in the city and it has a lot of VIP clientele. People typically spend $200 per person so their expectations on service are very high. I'm trying my best to make meet these expectations but I know this is going to be a huge challenge for me. This shift means I'll be calling all the shots and I'm very nervous. I'm plotting the floor, planning the reservations, trying to make sure servers have enough time before being sat again. It sounds like it will be incredibly difficult as my first shift going at this basically alone. Management has very little to do with assisting and I know I have to prove myself in this situation. This place seems to reserve more people than they have space for to generate the revenue they get, but this means a lot of times people end up waiting 30 to 45 minutes for a table they reserved in advance. I already know we have about 200 covers on the books and I'm just seeking out any advice I can get in advance to prepare myself. I'm comfortable with a lot of the procedures here but I've always had someone else working with me who has more experience. I'm typically going to them throughout the shift to ask questions or receive guidance. I feel like this scheduling of three new people on a busy night might have been an oversight on managements part, but it's already been done. At any other place I could see this not being a problem, but the service and attention we give to guests is a very tailored one and I worry that shit might hit the fan very quickly.

I got a job in January of 2018 at a large seafood restaurant in a brand new shopping area. What started out as a relatively normal restaurant has turned into a total joke, I honestly feel like I'm in a sitcom.

What was once a fully staffed restaurant, that can fit 260 guests now has 5 servers, one host (who works once a week) , no bussers and no food runners. I got moved up to serving out of complete necessity after a string of horrible managers and people quitting and with absolutely no training, I've been serving since November.

Two weeks ago I had to go in with a 101 degree fever because I'm the morning server. The restaurant opens with just me and one cook. To say I often get overwhelmed would be an understatement. So would saying it sucked to work with a fever because I literally couldn't call out. As the opening server, I am also my own bartender, busser, and food Runner.

The kitchen Chef had become the manager for a while, but it stressed him out because he wasn't trained for it, so he recently quit on Saturday and now we have no manager. I told him I needed tomorrow off (my reason being I'm going job hunting which I did not say) I work every morning as the opening server alone, and he didn't give me the day off because there's literally no one else to come in for me because we only have 5 servers.

I'm going to call out tomorrow because I need to do what's best for me. I can't lie though, I have crazy anxiety knowing that when I do, the restaurant will have to shut down because absolutely no one else can come in for the morning shift. Otherwise, I never have the time off to go job hunting since I work every morning until around 5:30.

I have been a very loyal employee to my restaurant and I took pride in the extra efforts I put in. Not to brag but I have a great work ethic, I show up early every shift, I stay late if need be, I actually work when I need to work, I pick up shifts if the managers need it covered, and in the 2 and a half years I’ve worked there I’ve called out 3 times due to throwing up sick.

To start I had to call out of a shift last Saturday due to throwing up as stated before. No big deal there were still 7 servers and 2 bartenders to cover me. Well when I showed up for work on Sunday I was pulled into the office and wrote up for it. To fully help you guys understand my coworkers and my baffled ness towards my manager for doing this, a girl that works there (let’s call her AB) calls out of her shifts at least twice a week and is constantly trying to get someone to cover her shifts, as she never works. Not once has she been wrote up. Another employee (well call GC) spent a week with her family in another state and after schedules were posted messaged my managers about being out of town for an extra week and not being able to work. She missed an entire week of work without covering her shifts. She was never wrote up. So you can now understand why I was dumbfounded when I got wrote up for calling out.

Loyal employees are treated like garbage at my job. I’ve put up with it for too long and I’m ready to quit. I talked to my GM about 6 months ago if it was okay to ask off for graduation (I live in a college town and my fiancé is graduating. The only way to have off on graduation is if you’re graduating) I was given the all clear to take off. I made plans with his family all that weekend (which was very hard because they live all over the country) and was very excited to take the weekend off to spend time with them. I was scheduled the entire weekend! If I don’t show up for my shifts I’ll be fired. I don’t want to end on bad terms with them as i have been there for a long time.

That’s not the part that angers me the most however. We are going to be losing a full time bartender in a few days and we have been training another girl with a shit work ethic to work bar. I was trained to work bar when my GM went on maternity leave and closed bar EVERY SINGLE Tuesday-Saturday for close to 4 months. And I was kept regularly on the bar schedule until recently when we lost a lot of servers. (Understandable) I specifically asked my managers if she will be given priority over me since she was promoted to being a full time bartender. I was told that she would only take the shifts I didn’t want, that I would have seniority over her since I was hired first and worked more. My schedule was just posted and I serve every day next week and she bartends every day next week. I would quit on the spot if I didn’t need a good reference from them and didn’t have rent to pay. I’m so over this place but I really need this job. I’m moving in a month across the state so no other place will hire me for just a month. I don’t know what to do.

Anyways. Long rant but thanks for the listen (read?)",0,"My final days are coming, thanks management",21

She sits down and after 5 minutes, catches me to ask me about her ice cream. So I dutifully pop my head around the kitchen, where the chef is still working on the steak, and go back to tell her it's not ready, as the chef's working on another order and it's just him in the kitchen.

She leaves, and in another 5 minutes, comes back a little more flustered and asking after her ice cream. It's been about 10 minutes since she ordered at this point. So I go into the kitchen, apologise to the chef and tell him that the customer is kicking off. I offer to do the ice cream myself, but he stops what he's doing and does it himself in a minute.

I carry the bowl out to the bar, where I walk into the middle of an argument. The boss has appeared since I went into the kitchen, obviously found out what's happened, and is sparring with the customer. I have no idea who started the argument, as the boss is known for being not too sensitive or politically correct, but I'm starting to see that this lady is a little more unhinged than I'd imagined.

I hand her the bowl mid argument, and the boss effectively says to her ""Go and keep it, you're not welcome here anymore."" The lady starts insulting my boss, then walks out the door and says to my boss ""You're a cunt.""

My boss, a little flustered himself, tells me not to serve her, which I wasn't planning to after that.

After about ten minutes or so, the woman comes back in with her empty ice cream bowl, looking pretty sour faced - it's just me on the bar this time. She tries to come over all sympathetic, telling me she's so sorry I have to work for such a horrible man. And then asks for a beer. Now, I'm not going to say my boss didn't speak out of turn, but I'm not prepared to tolerate any customer swearing at any member of staff, so I refuse to serve her, and she storms off.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've refused service to a customer in three years, but boy this time was satisfying.

So I work as a barista at a coffee shop. I'm usually on bar making the drinks but on this particular day I was put to work at the register because one of my newer coworkers was learning how to make drinks with my supervisor. This was a particularly busy day and the line was almost out the door so I was trying my best to take people's orders as fast as I could. At one point after I had finished helping a customer the next customer in line does this....

ME: I can help whoever's next

RC: \*turns to the line of people raises her hand, yells very loud\* THAT'S ME IT'S MY TURN, NO ONE GO IN FRONT OF ME!!

She comes up to the counter very annoyed by how long she had to wait and clearly was very frustrated about the wait.

I take her order and at the coffee shop I work at we have a rewards system that if you build up enough points you get a free drink. After looking up her rewards I noticed that RC had a enough points to get a free drink.

I let RC know that she can get a free drink so she decides to add another drink to the order, So that she only has to pay for one of the drinks but is getting two now. the thing about our reward system is that when you put in the drinks the free drink is always the one with the lower price. I try to explain to her that we could do two separate transactions so that she could get the most expensive drink free and then buy her second drink.

ME: ""Just letting you know that the free drink you want costs more than the first drink you ordered...""

She then interrupts me and says

RC: ""Whatever I don't care I'm in a hurry""

I then tell her the total of the one drink she has to pay for

RC: ""What?! Why is it more expensive""

I then try to calmly explain what I said before

RC: ""You know what I don't have time for this! Whatever take my money. You and this stupid company always keep finding ways to try and take advantage of me and my money! NO TIP FOR YOU!!!

I honestly just started laughing

She then proceeds to go to the bar side where my coworkers are making drinks. There also isn't really much of a barricade between us and the customers, so she stands pretty much right next to CO. CO, who is new, starts to make her drinks but has to look at the recipe because they don't know how to make everything yet but the recipes are pretty easy to follow and there isn't much you can do to screw them up.

RC: ""You know what if you don't know how to make them, I don't want them""

I find this insanely ironic since she made such a fuss about how we were taking her money and now is just like whatever I'll just pay for a drink and not get anything at all now.

My Manager finally hearing all the yelling comes out and tells me to make the drink since I'm more experienced on bar.

OC: \*rolls her eyes and gestures to me\* ""Are you kidding me right now""

ME: \*Stares at her\* ""Yeah I'm not doing this""

OC then takes her first drink doesn't even wait for the second and leaves.

I get that some people can be having a bad day but at some point in my personal opinion there are ways you should and shouldn't treat people who are just trying to help you out.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: One last thing, I think some people are getting a little confused on how the rewards system at my job works from the comments below. The customer has to give me their phone number for me to look up their points. So the reason that I tried to explain to her that we could do separate transactions was simply because I would have to put in her phone number for the rewards system all over again. I wasn't able to give her the more expensive free drink first because she had already ordered the first drink and our system doesn't allow you to make the most expensive drink free unless you put in the rewards for a second time (customers phone number).",0,Rude Customer Causes Scene Over Free drink Then Doesn't Take Free Drink,40

Fun part is apparently he’s had an issue before that the lobster wasn’t fresh.

We don’t sell near enough of it to make that feasible. 

So after I’ve taken his order today he tells me “and make sure it’s fresh”. I really didn’t know how to respond because who knows what this guy has asked/been told before so I just said okay. The lobster looked good as usual and he was perfectly happy with it, so no real issues.

I work at a New York style deli in Southern California that is very popular with the geriatric crowd. Today I was working my small 6 table section in the restaurant that has 50 or so tables. As I was rounding the corner from the kitchen with a Chef Salad in my hands, I saw a small Asian woman get up from one of my tables and bolt to the other side of the restaurant. I honestly thought she was running to the bathroom but she turned last second and that's when I saw what she was going for. A small elderly woman  in an orange turtleneck had her hands on her throat and mouth agape. I watched as the lady asked the older woman if she could breath and the woman shook her head no. The small, maybe 120 lbs lady then tried the squeeze the woman from behind but couldn't get a good grip or leverage. During this time I had tossed the salad onto the host stand and screamed to my manager to call 911 and that someone was choking. It was then that a fellow server yelled ""4828orange she's too small, you gotta do it"" so I took over for my customer and did what I could remember from a first aid training I took years ago and began trying to get the woman to spit up what was choking her. After 3 squeezed and the woman beginning to turn blue, one final squeeze and the lady made the slightest wheeze and color started to come back, but the food was still lodged in her mouth. By then another customer heard the announcement asking if there was a doctor in the house, he was a former policeman, and he took over, shoving his fingers down her throat which finally cause her to vomit up the meat that had almost cost this poor woman her life. She was breathing and able to stand on her own. The paramedics came to check her vitals and she was amazingly feeling great. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no, so they told her to enjoy her meal and left. I finally delivered my salad and went out back to take a breather and when I came back inside, the lady was eating her sandwich and drinking a beer! I couldn't believe it. She was very thankful to everyone who helped. Her 85th birthday is next month and she will be coming back to the restaurant to celebrate with us.

[MoBiLe UsEr] *The effect of our percieved self on others is truly extraordinary*

Tl;Dr: (idek if you do a ""tldr"" on posts like this) Do servers single-handedly shape the emotional consensus of their workplace? 

Has anyone thought about or come across any type of writings that touch on the significance of each individuals 'attitude' (self-awareness, mindset.. whatever else impacts the energy one gives out) of restaurant servers? In the few months I've been waiting tables, I've come to realize the strange underlying interpersonal dynamics of the industry and the complexity of levels it includes. Obviously we have to present a forced persona to customers and front a quasi-personable self to other staff (managers, hosts, cooks, Server Asst., Etc.).. but when dealing with our fellow servers, the dynamics are often very reflective of the restaurants 'vibe' as a whole in any given moment. 
What I mean is that if the kitchen is seemingly slower than normal on a pretty busy night and the bartender is new so some drinks are coming out a lil screwy... you can assume the servers are not showing any patience with each other and are probably very snappy with one another. 
-I would attribute this to the fact that we're the only ones dependent on tips and good relations with other staff (hosts that like you will be more concious of who they're sitting you and cooks that find you impressionable might help you out when you accidentally forgot a special request). If the other staff impedes, even slightly, the possibility of receiving the highest possible tip then I'm pissed but cant take it out on them because what if I ring in the wrong drink tomorrow night and the bartender is like ""lol, get a manager then asshole."" Therfore, itll likley come out on another server accidentally since we are the only ones that dont have to take shit from eachother.
OR, if it's a slower evening and everyone seems to be in a groove.. you go into the kitchen and the manager is working expo to help out and awe, how sweet. Tables are commenting on the perfect pacing and you actually find yourself in the back talking to the other servers about their day and how Joe went off on Jane on Saturday and feels bad now and yadda yadda yadda.. 
-when stress is significantly decreased, servers seem much more upbeat and friendly with one another, for obvious reasons. Shoot, I might even ask you if you need help with anything because I only have two tables and they're super chill. 

You know, stress=negative stress free=positive, right? Wrong. (Well sometimes).

So we've all had shifts that, in theory, should be gone well but maybe one of the servers come in after a bad day and they carry that negativity with them as they work; all the sudden I only have one tables but the host is sitting me again and now I'm calling the host a bitch for doing her job and who tf left there dishes on this P.O.S. stand?! A similar situation with everything reversed could make a overwhelming night one worth remembering. The uncontrollable circumstances that we usually classify as good/bad are meaningless in the face of how each server is presenting themselves. Negativity breeds insecurity and puts everyone on edge, radiating throughout the restaurant. Positivity allows us to perceive things in a more optimistic light; even more important, a positive outlook manifests itself into reality for all patrons. 
I guess I'm asking if anyone else has thoughts on this concept and if it even makes sense¿ I really think each server in a given shift carries the mood of the entire restaurant on their backs and can chose wether or not to go with definitive characteristics of a good/bad shift and further strengthen the initial vibe or allow they're energy to shift the tides of the prevailing attitudes.",0,Do waiters attitudes manifest themselves in other aspects of a restaurant?,4

after their meal, me and another server thought it would be nice to give the boys a little mango ice cream sundae each. of course the birthday boy had a candle! 

i will never forget that little boys face, he was so happy and it was so heart warming to see his face light up!

Chain- pro/ established procedures and legal saftey. con/ customers tend to suck and nobody really has a passion for the restaurant.
Franchise- basically a chain..
Start-up- pro/ initial opportunity to help shape work procedures and grow with company. con/ that mess is probably gunna go under in a year
Mom and pop- pro/ loyal customers and opportunities for personal mobility within restaurant. con/ can be sketch and low-yielding
Local favorite- (like seafood restaurants along boardwalks and stuff) pro/ typically high traffic and passionate customers cons/ staff is usually very clicky and there's often very clear off-seasons

The Scene: Popular brunch spot that is open until 2:30, and only serves breakfast foods. We go on a wait around 9:30/ 10am on the weekends, and usually stay on a wait until closing time, especially Sundays. Also, we have 4 different POS stations, 3 in the back, and 1 up front so the host can take/ enter in to go orders easily.

Yesterday was craziness. The center we are in was hosting a parade of sorts, plus the movie theater that is in the same center was doing promos for the Avenger's End Game ALL WEEKEND. It was packed, and not just our restaurant, but the whole area. 

Our kitchen fell behind at about 10:30/11 on Sunday and never caught up. We were experiencing 20-30 minute ticket times. And this is breakfast guys, there really are no appetizers, just mimosas and lattes until the food arrives. So after waiting for a table, now people are also waiting forever for their food. I don't blame some of them for getting hangry, I would too. 

All of the back 3 POS stations are full, so I go up front in order the check out one of my tables ASAP so I can turn and burn that bitch and make more money. A rather tall and broad gentleman approaches me and asks what section I was in. I politely pointed it out (it was basically the whole back wall). He then asked my name, while reaching out his hand to shake mine. I tell it to him as we're shaking, and OMG guys. He told me hes going to request being in my section next time. He says I was his family's server last weekend (Easter) and he noticed a large difference in the service provided. 

I. Was. Floored.  I haven't even been serving at this place for a whole month yet, I'm still learning my side work, the POS layout for entering in orders, and getting the table numbers down. 

I did warn him that the kitchen was different this weekend then last weekend, but I thanked him profusely and told him I would be looking forward to it. 

I had a shitshow of a day on Saturday, 4 tables in my 6 hour shift with major problems (some my fault, some the kitchens fault, still messed with my head a bit but we all have off days). To have this gentleman come up to me on Sunday and tell me that, I was so relieved and over the moon.

Eventually, our shit show of a hostess (never does her job) finally leaves, servers are cut and it's just me and the other closer.

So we had a bar regular named “John” who just started frequenting our family restaurant bar so often that I went from ordering a case of mich ultra a week to three cases a week. John tipped well and bought people drinks. For some reason had a lot of money for a handy man. But John was NOT polite. 



Then John started bringing in his “employees.” These were young men who just acted like they had never been in a restaurant before. If John didn’t pick up the tab they didn’t tip. I explained to one guy the seat number on his ticket on three different occasions(“I didn’t order three shots of grey goose!” “No, you’re seat three. His ticket has a two, and his ticket has a one” “so a shot is $9?!!” Are you telling me you assumed one shot was $3?) The guy that worked with him the longest was “Bill” and Bill was the kind of person who’d I have to tell him that my name is not “hey.” John told us the he was no longer picking up Bill’s tab and I noticed that he’d still NEVER pay for his drinks. He started flirting with this poor girl who was new in town and she started getting his drinks. 



Then John got the entitled regular complex. Told a manager his wife had a coupon for a free appetizer on her phone and the manager responds “well there’s your phone, have her send it to you.” And he responded with “you know I come here all the time” so? 



Then one Friday night the kitchen was struggling REALLY bad. I was being really straightforward to guests and telling them their food would take about half an hour. Luckily, John and bill ordered burgers and their food only took 25 minutes. Wasn’t a big deal until the next day when the GM was in. Told him the food took 45 minutes! Ranted and rambled about the bad service and during the ranting the time changed to 50 minutes, then an hour, all the way up to an hour and a half. His story started at 45 minutes and ended saying food took an hour and a half. That’s when I started calling John a scam artist. 



So I’m gonna be honest, if I don’t want you at my bar I’m going to try my best to make you not want to be at my bar either. You’ll get your drinks and your food will be correct but that is it. So eventually I’d come in at 4 for my Friday night shift and they’d all tab out and leave. Cool. But that’s not what made them stop coming in entirely. 



My best friend is the weekday bartender and I’m the weekend bartender. Shift change is at 4 and I can’t make it in that early during the week so I show up at 5 one day for a serving shift and she has the BEST news. Two of her bar guests know John because they hired him to do some work, paid half up front, then never heard from him again. HE IS ACTUALLY A SCAM ARTIST. So John walks in, sees them, and with his “I know everyone!” Complex WALKS UP TO THEM AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND THEIR SHOULDERS. She shouts “where’s my money?!” He says “I’ll get you your money” and shoots out the door. 



We haven’t seen John, Bill, the woman Bill was convincing to pay for his drinks, or the couple John scammed since then.

255,beezleboss1,0,t3_bijv4l,10,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bijv4l/my_first_i_am_the_manager_story/,"So I am a manager at a very successful local restaurant. I’ve seen many celebrities come in, and talk with them. Been working here for 5 years or so, so I know the ins and outs. I finally became a manager 6 months ago. 

What started out as me feeling bad for a guy, turned south real quick. I was minding my own business, helping out bus and stuff. When a female coordinator came to me, saying a homeless guy is asking for free food. Now at the time I was under the impression that it’s not allowed by owners/law. But I felt for the guy as I’ve volunteered at shelters, and it was cold in mid February. I told the coordinator that he can have this desert that basically costs us under a dollar. 

She comes back to me and says that he doesn’t “eat that type of stuff”. I was dumbfounded, food is food ya know? Then she said that he will go to the sushi place nearby and they give him rice. So, I did just that. Rice, tomatoes, and a lil soy sauce. 

I come to him, sit him down at the end of the bar, let him eat that bowl and talk to me. He made a comment being like “thanks for everything you are able to give me”. Which he had a weird flair to it. I ignored and we talked about Catholicism. We casually talked about the different ways it was taught for him vs I. Was a nice chat. We then started to drift to talking about our lives in a sense. He asked me if I was going to school or what else I do. I told him I just graduated with a bachelors, and currently looking for a new job. I tried to stay as brief about the subject because I did not want to make him upset by bringing up his past. Although I wasn’t dismissing him either, if he wished to bring up his past then that’s fine. Of course he bridges to his past and i continue to listen. I am sympathetic to homeless people and most of the time they want someone to just listen. But this is where it kind of started to go downhill. 

He talked about how he’s only 40, and just a couple years ago he was making six figs, had a wife and a kid. Everything was going perfect. The life of making it as an American. Then his job “for whatever reason thought what he was doing was illegal”, and slapped him with a felony. He was convicted and his family left him, and he could not afford to live on his own because of divorce and other issues. He then mentioned that he goes to church nearby all the time, and talks to a pastor where he’s told everything can get better with more effort. I kind of just listened this entire time. He then asked about my pastor and what I think as a Christian brother. I told him I’m not sure what your situation is, and I’m not to judge.  He then asked if the bowl of food was the only thing I could get him. Little did he know, I had another bowl plus a lot of chicken on the way, made to go, for him to have as a gift goodbye. I told him I’m not sure if I can do much more. He interjected and was like “I think you can -morally- but your job requires you to follow immoral laws”. I agreed, but said I need to keep my job and follow the rules. Right when this happened a food runner hands me the bag to go. Here I also had a number/addy of the shelters I knew. I hand him the bag, explain the places, and I tell him he can’t eat what I’m giving him here because I can get fired. I tell him that I hate to do this but if he comes back, that he needs to pay for SOMETHING. I said he could pay for the white rice, and that’s $1.50, and I can do more for him after that. I just need a payment slip. Otherwise if he doesn’t pay for a dime, then I need to get authorities involved. After all this, he starts going through our religion citing many sources of when it is applicable to just do the “right thing” even if you fall for the actions. I would tell him many times, I’m sorry man, it’s immoral, but I have this job and I’m trying to do the most moral thing within my rules given to me. Eventually he’s getting so irritated that I’m seeing right through all of this, that he’s getting red, rocking back and forth, and his tone is pissed. 

He tries that tactic of religious guilt again. I say the same shit. He then finally says it “WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER, I WANT TO SEE HIM OR HER, BECAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS”. 

Never in my head have I had such a feeling of -I’m that mother fucker! 

So I paused (mind you I have stayed calm this entire time), and look him in the eyes and say “I am the manager”. He looks at me, says “wait, you’re the manager?” I repeated myself. His eyes looked like they were on fire, ready to shoot me to Valhalla. He stumbled to get his words, but then asked “well I want to have your bosses phone number or the owners phone number and talk to them!”  My response: “I am sorry to inform you, but I can’t do that. “

Him: yes you can, if you were really a catholic, you would give me their phone numbers so I can tell them how terrible and immoral of a person you are!

Me: sorry man, my job is to deal with things like this all the time. They don’t need or want to have to respond to every single person that has this type of issue. Only people that are doing business or personally know them, am I allowed to give their information to.  

Him: You-you are going to hell for this, you know that? How does that make you feel? To harm another Christian. You must be some evil having devil. 

Me: sir, I don’t see where you’re coming from entirely. I want to help you out the most I can, and I have. I wish things were different but legally I’m not allowed to give free food away to homeless people. I’m sorry about your situation, but if you just pay and have a receipt for the cheapest thing, I can give you more food. 

Him (now shouting): Now that’s bullshit! You are vile scum of this planet and deserve to be put up in flames in hell!!! 

Me: alright sir, it’s time to go. I’m sorry, but I can’t have anyone behaving like this here in front of customers, and frankly I think your behavior is out of line. If you come back and refuse to pay for anything or try to get more free food, cops will be called. 

Him: I CURSE YOU, YOUR SOUL, BODY AND MIND IS CURSED!! 

he started to head out the front door, and then turned around, just to curse me one more time. 

I feel bad for all of this. I do wish I could have done more, and I think his mental health isn’t all the way there, but I couldn’t do anything else. 



TL;DR: homeless man comes into restaurant, demands free food because sushi place gives him rice - I give same thing/listen to his issues, just to then be yelled at because I wouldn’t give him more free shit after this visit, so he wants manager (me) which pisses him off more and then has to be kicked out.",0,My first “I am the manager” story,50

Note: I have worked three doubles in a row and I am stressed out from school and family. 


A family of four walk in with a couple bags, it’s a bit busy but nothing any of the servers can’t handle. They are perfectly nice, making jokes, everything is good. All they want is two pizzas and a platter of mozzarella sticks. So far so good. Food takes a little bit long because there are other orders that are a bit complex. I explain it to them and they are perfectly fine with this. 

Food comes up, they are enjoying themselves. But then the woman pukes into one of the bags. And she is a bit loud. I feel panicky right now, idk what to do. She asks if I can walk her to the bathroom, I immediately comply. I don’t leave to go to my other tables to help her out for about eleven minutes. She says she can go back to her table. I go back to my tables and I am comping their bill. 

Then the busses comes to me and gives me a receipt. She accidentally dropped a receipt for fake vomit onto her napkin. Are you kidding me? People are leaving, stiffing tips, bad reviews because of this. 

I get the bill un-comped. I hand the check to them and they are saying it should be comped. I raise my voice a little for my tables in the section to hear me say that I know it’s fake vomit and show them the receipt. 

The family is shocked, pay the bill, actually tip okay. My other tables apologize for them as if it’s their fault.  They tip better to help me ‘fix’ the money and time I lost. Manager says they are now banned.

Has anyone given their number to a customer though? I'd like to hear your stories!

I'll share mine.

I did this for the first time a few weeks ago. I work in a restaurant that is surrounded by at least 7 hotels, 2 of which are right across the street from where I work. So we get a lot of men come in by themselves during the week who I assume are traveling through my town. Had this one guy come in by himself and sit in my section. As I approached him to greet him I was in awe at how good looking he was. He was real easy going. Ordered a beer and an appetizer as his meal. Was really nice and didn't ask for much. I kept talking to a couple of coworkers about how I was drooling over this man and his hotness. One of them said I should give him my number. Now I'm not the kind of person to typically just give my number out to men I find attractive so I was hesitant at first. But I thought what the hell, the worst he can say is no he has a girlfriend (I made sure he wasn't wearing a wedding ring) or he just wasn't interested. I went for it and wrote my number on the credit card receipt. I swear I was like a little girl crushing because I was too much of a nervous wreck to go back to his table. Finally a coworker came and told me she went by his table and he was asking for me. I went back over there and he was so floored I gave him my number. At first he thought it was a prank because of how nervous I looked and the fact that things like this never happen to him. But I assured him it wasn't and I had never done something like this before. Ha. We talked for a few and he said he travels for work and was single. And he asked what time I got off that night. So off he went with my number and left me wondering if he was actually going to call me or not. A few hours go by and he finally does. We talked and decided to meet up that night at a 24/7 restaurant nearby. We just got drinks and talked. But we've been texting and talking on the phone a lot since. He came back about a week ago and we hung out again. He's supposed to be back in my town again within the next few weeks and we're planning in hanging out again.

So this happened right after I turned 18, my first waitressing job. 

I aged out of foster care at 18 with a 1yr old infant who's father turned out to be a deadbeat. When I aged out, I was homeless because my caseworker was garbage at her job. So I needed this job, I was desperate for cash. I was lucky enough to be able to stay with my step sister until I got on my feet. I got this job, it paid shitty but tips were okay and the hours were alright, I was getting 20-25 hrs a week. I will say I was raised Irish Catholic and town we were in was abt 5k people, with 9 Churches of differing forms of Christianity &amp; 1 Jewish Synagogue.

I waited this table of 4, two ladies and two gentlemen. They were very nice, polite, and overall I thought they were great customers.... At first.

They left me Church cards with the tip, but how they did this is what broke me. 

It was like a folded card, that while closed looked like a folded $100. They even folded some $1's around the outside of it and inside, but the number 100 was still visible.

Walking up, it looked real. I knew these were church people, they told me so, they had just come from Church. I was so excited upon seeing it, these people had gushed non-stop about Jesus, His love, and how He gives when we really need it. I thought maybe these people were going out of their way to help someone out. I needed diapers and formula so this would be extremely helpful.

As soon as I picked up the stack I could tell it was fake. It was a heavy duty paper, and when you opened it, it had the Church information,

**Matthew 19:24** 
*Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.*

And finally the quote, ""INVEST IN JESUS""


I am not a crier, and definitely not in public... This made me cry on the spot. Damn near instantaneously I had tears flowing down my face. It broke me to see this, I had to rush into the kitchen to collect myself. The actual tip was $4 on a ~$50 meal split between 4 people. I kept the job for another week before being allowed to start training as one of the assistant chefs.


TL;Dr
Seemingly very nice Church people who nonstop talked about Jesus and His ability to give just when you need it, not only tipped $4 on a ~$50 bill but also had a fake 100 dollar bill folded between the $4 tip that looked realistic AF until picking it up, where on discovery it opens to be a biblical quote about rich people not getting into Heaven &amp; an advert to come join their Church and INVEST IN JESUS.",0,Elderly Church People Break My Heart,127

It’s been going on since the first week of me stepping foot in that place. About my breasts. How he wants to have sex with me. And it escalated to him physically touching me. I was sexually assaulted in college so it makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

The story really starts when we supposed to be suspended for touching a girl and as a result, she hit him. She got suspended but somehow he is back and it has only been two days.That day, This man was being extremely inappropriate. More than usual. In a way that’s like “you can’t touch me, I’m immune to punishment.”

The night everything happened, she came in at the END of the night and was DRUNK because she was picking up another co-worker. They were at the host stand and he was literally feeling her up and all. 

So I confronted her and said “you need to quit speaking on shit that has nothing to do with you” and she goes “whatever, I don’t care” and walks away and was looking at me funny all shift.

I laughed.

Things came to a boiling point when she called me out my name while I was cleaning her tables for a 10 top because she took forever to clean them. She called me a “dumb ass” for “sitting guests at dirty tables.” I lost it. And i shouldn’t have. I called her out her name and told her she’s making herself look like a clown by holding on to it.

This man, who had to be about 60ish, came in one night with his wife. I had 4 other tables besides this older couple. I wasn’t overwhelmed, just busy.
This couple had two waters with lemon, and both ordered salmon.
The man ordered a side salad (which is a .99 cent upcharge that I informed him about)
And the salmon doesn’t take long to cook.
However, I had two other tables needing me at the same time when I was supposed to be making this older mans salad.
Where I work, servers made the salads up until like three weeks ago and they switched our systems around and now the kitchen makes them.
So this mans food comes out as I’m leaving the 4 top table that is seated beside them, that I’d been at for about 5 minutes, answering questions and taking their order.
The server that dropped the food off starts to walk away and I ask the older couple if they need anything to go with their meals.
The man starts asking about his salad.
I apologized and told him I would go get it for him immediately if he’d still like to have it.
And he starts getting kind of rude, saying, “What kind of place lets the food come before the salad?”
And I originally thought he was joking because I’ve learned older men have a strange sense of humor so I tried to give him a small smile and apologize again.
And he says, “Do you think I’m joking?”
At this point, the table I’d just left started to get quiet and the man starts SCREAMING at me.
Saying how I’m not getting a tip, why would I deserve a tip since his salad didn’t come out before the meal.
I take full responsibility for not getting his salad.
I could’ve done things differently and made his salad before asking the other table if they wanted to order.
I apologized repeatedly and asked him if he still wanted it.
He said he did but he wants to speak to a manager. I told him that I’d grab his salad and let a manager know.
He then says, “no, you know what? I don’t want the salad. But I DO want to speak to your manager.”
I told him I understood and I’d go grab my manager.
He stops me again and says, “no, I do want the salad but I don’t want to speak to your manager. I don’t want to get you in trouble. But I’ll take the salad.”

At this point, his wife seemed embarrassed. She’d told him to calm down a couple times already.
I told him I’d grab his salad then walked away.

I informed my manager about the situation while I was making his salad (even though he said he didn’t want to speak to her, I wasn’t about to deal with this man alone) so she went to speak to him.

(Now the worst thing I could’ve done was forget to take his side of dressing with his salad. Which I did forget to do. So I dropped the salad and his wife asks, “is the dressing in there?” And I realized I forgot his damn dressing because I was so panicked to get him the salad.)

I walked back to my section to drop off the salad dressing and one of my other tables was getting up to leave and started saying, very loudly, “Let’s get the f*ck out of here. I’m not gonna listen to this sh*t” referring to the man who was upset about his salad, and was yelling at my manager now, saying “We drove an hour to come here. We should’ve just stayed in our city.”
At that point, all of the tables in my section and a couple of tables in the section beside mine had gone silent and were all looking over at the table leaving and the man yelling at my manager.
My manager kept her cool and apologized, she offered to take off the upcharge for the salad but he said he didn’t want anything for free. So she left it.

Each time I went back to the table, only the wife spoke to me. She was nice but didn’t say much.
They tipped me $2 which was more than I was expecting.
But his outburst caused two of my other tables to write me very sweet notes on their receipts and tip me well over 20%

At the time, I was very upset because I don’t like being publicly screamed at (who does?) but especially for something that was an honest mistake and I tried to do everything in my power to fix. But now it’s just funny to me.

Some context:: A month ago or so, our coke addict district manager guy came in to evaluate our restaurant. All went seemingly well for us staff.. managers, on the other hand, supposedly got quite the shakedown. After his visit, the managers started getting oddly strict on 'uniform' standards (not just like nametags -one of the newer managers actually started checking the bottom of shoes for slip-resistance) and sales goals. This weird top-down behavior only intensified as weeks went on -even our one cool manager seems to of caved. This all had just become a mildly annoying part of every shift that everyone kinda dealt with. That was until yesterday morning... our schedule for next week comes out and I'm scheduled only THREE days and none of those days are on the weekend. Wtf? I went to work and discovered I was not alone, our management has decided to implement ""performance-based scheduling.""
Dont get me wrong, I can totally understand the reasoning behind performance-based schedules, I know restaurants are business and it's all a money game. I dont mind playing the game as long because if I know what numbers I need to focus on then I have a clear goalpost to see where I stand. I asked my manager what metrics they're looking at when making these new schedules and she basically tells me that it's an accumulation of comparative sales (meaning how much each server sold in gross, amount of guests per week, and tip percentages as compared to other servers that same week), attendance (she specified that they're taking into account even those who clock in within five minutes of their scheduled start time), how quickly we're bussing tables, uniform quality, how often we run food, and a few other subjective af stipulations; one of the very tenured severs (27 years) even asked for clarification, ""so, our schedules are now based on the managers perception of what we each individually do?"" Yes. 
We just recently got a whole slew of new servers so thats how this whole move was made; prior to them completing all their training the restaurant was simply too understaffed to afford not having everyone work at LEAST 5 days a week (most of which were also doubles) and everyone working there had been for half a year or longer so it was a pretty chill environment since we always knew what had to be done and how to do it. The only people whose hours were not cut so severely were closers/openers and cashcheckers because the managment obviously know who they cant afford to piss off. Anyways, I'll probably be looking for a new job soon -one where my contributions are measured in sales and not flawed, biased managers. 


Any insight or experience of similar situations?? 

tl;dr: seasoned servers at restaurant get hours cut in half as a result of new ""performance-based schedules."" The performance, however, is measured by subjective managerial perception of each individuals contribution and not objective data analysis.

None of the other cooks could really do the job because they weren't trained there so it would have been a manager jumping in and doing it. Not a huge problem but it would be better to have that manager on expo or on the floor. 

One of the servers begged the lunch cook to stay, and said ""I'll get the rest of the servers to throw a few dollars in a pot for you as a thank you if you stay!"" Ultimately he did stay and she came around to collect cash from us ($3-5 each. There were 20 of us on the floor). 

Now, I think she was out of line for doing that without getting consensus from the rest of the servers. 1) he's already getting more money by staying there longer. It's not like he isn't already being paid for his time. 2) if he thinks he needs more money than that to stay, I don't see how that's our responsibility to compensate him. 3) it sets a bad precedent.

I have never in my years of restaurant experience been confronted by a server on the tip amount.  I have always tipped well and honesty did not calculate what to leave.  I contacted the owner but have not hear anything back.  I wonder how many other customers have been confronted about tipping from this server.  Very unprofessional in my opinion.""



Ma'am, you tipped me $12 on your $146 bill. That's less than 10%. You took up three hours of my time, your date showed up an hour late and was rude as hell when he sat down. I waited on you hand and foot, giving you EXCELLENT service, making sure you got the extra olives you asked for and that your date's meal was 100% pork free. You interrupted me while I was in the middle of taking dinner orders for the table next to you and rolled your eyes when I told you I would be with you in just a moment. 
When you left in a hurry you forgot your phone on the table, I happened to glance at your tip before running out to give you your phone. When I did return the phone I politely asked if there was anything wrong with the service. Because tipping me less than 10% is usually a bad sign. You said the service was amazing and the food was delicious, all I wanted to know was if there was something I could do in the future to make your experience better. 

AT NO POINT DID I ASK FOR MORE MONEY. I DIDN'T EVEN BRING UP THE TIP AMOUNT UNTIL YOU ASKED ME WHAT IT WAS. 

You spent $12 for every martini you drank but you think I deserve $12 for THREE HOURS of my time? That's $4/hr. 

I don't care if you consider that unprofessional, but I consider your tip a complete slap in the face and I will never waste my time serving you again.

I’m you’re typical server. I do typical server things, and I try my damn best. I’d say I’m pretty fucking good at what I do even trying to calm stupid angry people down, but not this time. 

Friday night, pretty slow. I haven’t really had any problems besides the usual people who stiff bc they’re cheap. Got over it, comes with the job. People who complain about free rolls when they can’t get them in 2 seconds, ya know the usual. Then I get this prize box with this cocksucker. 

I approach the tableand I say my spill HI IM SUCH N SUCH CAN I OFFER YOU A COKE OR TEA. Ya know whatever. It’s a man, woman, and a child. And the woman says what her and the kid wants and the man just stares blankly at the menu. And doesn’t say much. His wife, I assume, asked him what he wanted and answered her but not me. Whatever maybe he’s just unsociable. I get their drinks, rolls. The whole drill and ask them what they wanted, and I recommend whatever is popular. The woman gets basic chicken tenders, the child pizza, and the man orders a steak (well-done) 

I put the order in and bring it out when it’s ready. I wait my 2 minute deal so it gives them time to look at it and eat it and I get to the table and say “everything pretty good” and I kid you fucking not this man actually spoke to me. And said “ EVERY MOTHER FUCKING TIME I COME IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING PLACE MY STEAKS NEVER COOKED RIGHT AND ITS FUCKING RETARDED. THE COOKS ARE RETARED.” And I actually was so angry within the first few seconds my mind just stopped and I calmly asked him if he wanted a new one, or something else that i could provide it for him, he continued to tell me I’m stupid bc I wasn’t listening to his concern. And then yelled “I DIDNT EVEN WANNA BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THE ONLY REASON WAS BC EVERYTHING ELSE WAS BUSY AND CLEARLY YALL ARE PIECES OF SHIT” I was like okay and walked away. 

I came back and told him that the manger has taken care of his meal and I apologized and again yelled and me and told me “ I’m fucking sick and tired of you apologizing because you can’t even fucking fix it” 

And I forgot to tell y’all the best part. It  WAS well done, and I was just confuse the whole time lol

Honestly knowing who I am I would usually fight back but I walked away and handed him the check or whatever was left and told him “it’s just food”

Due to this, I developed a ‘customer service voice’ because it’s more pleasant than my often bitter attitude and always brought in better tips and higher sales (more $$). 

This voice carries over when I make phone calls to companies or go to restaurants because I know the job can suck and I don’t want to be the customer that makes it suck. Recently, a friend I go out with often and who has heard me make a few phone calls told me she hates when I do that voice because I sound ‘fake.’ Girl, that’s the entire point...

He dresses well, talks very loudly, sings along with the music, and is kind of oblivious to how much attention he attracts. Normally he's lovely and we all love having him there and sometimes kids will try to film him and we get really upset about that. So that gives you an idea of how he is: eccentric, but lovely.

However, I've experienced him being in a bad mood twice in the year I've been there and last night was one of them. He really likes these frozen non-alcoholic drinks and will order three to five a night. The bartenders before me have figured out how he really likes them so they taught me, and I became a bartender a few weeks ago and he's always liked how I make his drinks. But last night? Wow. He really enjoyed his first two drinks. Then we had to make new puree and we do that at the bar so he watched us and I think the placebo effect kicked in because maybe he didn't always know there was puree and watching us make it had something click in his mind. When he got his third drink, he got very angry. He will be R for regular and I will be Me.

&amp;#x200B;

R: Does this have puree?

Me: Yes

R:  Is it different than usual?

Me: No

R: It doesn't taste as raspberry

Me: I'm sorry - I can remake it for you

R: No, no, I'll drink it, but it doesn't taste as raspberry. Did you use puree?

Me: Yes, puree is the main part of this drink. I can make you a new one.

R (getting more and more upset): I DON'T WANT A NEW ONE. BUT IT TASTES DIFFERENT. WHY DID YOU USE PUREE?

Me: It's the main part of the drink. We always use puree in these. I made it the same as usual but I am happy to make you a new one if you would like.

R: I'M GOING TO DRINK IT. I DON'T WANT A NEW ONE. (even louder) I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING TO YOU.

Me: I know you're trying to communicate something. I hear you. It doesn't taste as raspberry. I don't have an answer as to why but I am happy to make you a new one so you like it better.

(At this point it sort of went in circles with him asking if the drink was made differently, me saying no and offering to make a new one, him asking if there was puree and why, and asking if we made the puree differently. The whole time, he was yelling at me to the point that other customers were looking around and watching. Then this happened.)

R (still yelling. I  don't mean taking a tone. I mean yelling) : When you eat steak, is there anything you wouldn't put on it because it would make it taste different?

Me: I'm not sure, I don't really eat meat.

R (nearly in tears of frustration): I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WILL YOU JUST HUMOR ME

Me: Fine.

R: When you eat steak or ground beef, is there anything you wouldn't put on it because it would take away from the flavor?

Me (humoring him like he asked): Sure.

R: Well what? A1? Barbecue sauce? Other flavoring?

Me: Sure.

Him: WHICH ONE!!!!??????!!!!?????

Me: I don't know, I just told you I don't eat meat, so I don't know what I wouldn't put on it.

R: Okay, well why would you use puree if it takes away from the flavor?

Me: We always use puree. This drink is always made with puree. It is one of the main ingredients. It doesn't take away from the flavor. It is the flavor, along with syrup. Do. You. Want. Me. To. Remake. It.

Him: NO I'M GOING TO DRINK IT BUT YOU WOULDN'T PUT STEAK SAUCE ON STEAK IF IT TAKES THE FLAVOR AWAY.

did 280 pax, with FOUR waitstaff. This meant that my float kept getting pulled to take orders and the manager was solving other problems.
Despite all I know I nearly broke - the lobby was consistently full yet I couldnt leave the register due to taking payments, the phone ringing became the sound track of the night and I couldn't seat people despite having tables available simply because I was consistently serving people.

All said in done there was still a lot of compliments that came to my staff and for that Im proud. However, I never want to feel that anxiety again at work. No one should have to feel that the experience of 280 guests rests solely on them because at the end of the day I was the one greeting and farewelling them, informing them of the 30min wait FOR A TABLE and thanking them for their patience.

I guess live and learn right - and they don't pay us the big bucks for nothing.

A table however was getting very annoyed with me because their drinks and food weren’t coming out fast enough.

So I picked up checks to run cards and whatnot and this guy had written “tip: $4.xx” on the itemized receipt.  Okay, odd, but whatever, I run the cards and proceed with business as usual. His slip looks like any other credit card slip with option for tip, total, signature. Only difference is his slip shows the remaining balance on his gift card. I drop the checks assuming he’ll figure it out. 


Well my mistake, I should have taken a moment to explain. I saw them leaving as I was running about and next time I entered the dining room noticed him alone at the table so I asked “Did you get everything sorted out?”  Which is when he proceeded to have a meltdown. 


He rants about it taking 5 minutes to find me and threatens to take away my tip for that. He doesn’t understand any of the paperwork I put in front of him. I apologize and calmly explain everything to him.

tldr; A proven fake ass review targeted at me causes temporary embarrassment from exposure, but soon evokes a cool ass bonding experience with coworkers over our mutual hatred of shitty customers and the manager. 

*scroll down to bottom for lessons to be learned*

I work at this exclusive but popular as heck soft serve and dessert chain based in California, and I’ve been here since the day it opened (around 3 months ago ish i think). I’ve always tried to be the nicest person when working the cashier, smiling till I feel my cheeks hurt, my little asian eyes squint like they’re almost closed, exposing my gums to the rude customers in an attempt to get more tips and possibly a smile out of them too. (spoiler: Never. Works.)

Long story short, I’m fake and I’m nice. My voice gets an octave higher when talking to customers. Yeah customers suck most of the time and I want to strangle the rude entitled ones but what can you do.

This has been going strong for a few months now, this fake ass disguise and me being a decent employee, until two days ago — my manager angrily messaged me a screenshot saying I had a two star yelp review targeted right at me.

It was something along the lines of “WIISHDOM is a name I will never forget because I couldn’t believe a person could be this rude!! Something something rolled her eyes something something condescending tone something something insert bullshit here. I hope she gets fired and gtfo!! One extra star though bc food was good and family loved it. WIISHDOM was so mean!!” (caps lock is accurate). 

I couldn’t FUCKING believe it. Yeah I don’t like my job but who does? I basically work three jobs right now and I know good customer service when I see it, and I can replicate that shit so well. I would never do anything to risk my job bc you best know I need the extra money, and I’m just not that type of person overall.

I was mad and sad and confused as hell. I stalked that review and the person who posted it. The account was brand new. Started the day the review was posted. No followers. No previous posts. No nothing.

There’s a lot of people that don’t like me. I bet it’s one of them (thinking of names as I’m typing this). 

I fucking know the review isn’t real. I can feel it in my bones. 

To eliminate bias, I literally asked all my coworkers and friends to see what they thought, and most of them said the same thing (or maybe they were so mad they made an account just to write this review, but highly doubt that).

Oh but guess what? The manager literally sent that screenshot to the 40+ people who work in the store soon after. Said they should learn from my mistakes and “do the literal opposite of what wiishdom did.” Literally something out of a teen horror film. Literal wave of embarrassment. Kanagawa is quaking. 

The good thing is that all the coworkers who truly know me and my work ethic know this is fake as fuck, and I grew closer with some people from our mutual dislike of shitty ass customers and our manager bc it’s so obvious they all just wanted us to suffer. 

Genuinely want to just show my manager all the evidence that proves the review is fake, but I can literally already hear he response echoing through my ears. Her literal catch phrase. The ONLY phrase I hear her say: “The customer is always right, wiishdom.” (alongside “stop slacking off” (through the phone that is, manager is never in the shop and just stares at us through the cameras) and “checks are in”). 

LESSON TO BE LEARNED: 

If you’re one of those people who have never worked in the retail or food industry, please understand where we’re coming from. 99% of customers suck. Be the 1%. Also don’t write fake reviews? Wtf? 

If you’re a person who’s job is in the retail or food industry (or multiple like me), I fucking pat you on the back with my right hand, while my left is doing the same unto myself.

Thank the heavens for Kate though, she had a big table of mixed moms and kids in her section (spoiler: the Table of Evil (ToE)) plus a couple of other tables and was breezing around completely unperturbed. As a not-very-good server, it was awesome to be around someone who just never panicked.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why when Kate came into the back nearly in tears, everyone was stunned.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently the ToE had accused her of deliberately messing up the kid's meals because ""they wouldn't notice and she (Kate) didn't care"". Turns out, it was the kitchen's fault (they mixed up two different orders). One of the other girls was expo-ing that night, so Kate had swung by after everything was delivered and just gotten blasted before she even realized there was an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Kate, of course, grabbed up the incorrect plates and took them into the back to get everything remade, then went out to make sure everything else was OK and fill drinks and stuff. But the moms at the ToE just laid into her. Told her she was stupid, obviously had this job instead of a real one because she failed out of school, and trash like her shouldn't be allowed to serve people food (we got all this from her between sobs).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit, I was stunned into non-reaction. I mean, I'd love to say I led the charge to tell this lady and her kids where to stuff it, but nope. I was trying to calm Kate down and make sure she was going to be OK. Our manager, who was not great, went to the ToE, apologized for the minor mistake, and told them that another server would be taking them. They laughed. No kidding, they laughed. Like it was some achievement they had run Kate off with their crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that was it for the rest of us. The manager went around to everyone and asked them to take the ToE. We all refused. Kate, still wiping tears off her cheeks, said she would finish it out, but neither the manager, nor any of us, would let her (for entirely different reasons). The manager herself ended up working the ToE while Kate darted around to the rest of her tables and tried to avoid eye contact with the evil bitches.

&amp;#x200B;

The upshot? The ToE tipped the manager, who kept it for herself. They got a pile of free food and coupons to come back since their experience had been so ""terrible"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Kate started crying in the back again after her shift and the manager told her to get over it. It was an unmitigated disaster all around.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's the story of how Kate, the best server I ever worked with, went and and got a job at the new restaurant opening down the street less than a week later. And that was the beginning of the end for me at that place as well, to be honest. I left about five months later after another issue with the same manager, and most of the good people either preceded me or followed me out.

&amp;#x200B;

That location closed about a year after I quit. Now, I'm not saying Kate's awesomeness would have kept it open, but it did feel like the proverbial straw on the camel, if you get my meaning...",0,The Ballad of Kate and the Table of Evil,371

I've read through a number of topics and I've seen different opinions. Some say to go with a chain because they it's good all-around training that will prepare you to work anywhere. Is it true that with an independent restaurant you'll be learning to do things ""their way"" and it won't prepare you for other restaurants?

The argument against a chain is that it's a lot to handle for a new server because they have big expectations (managing multiple tables at once). 

If you do recommend a chain, which one is best? A lot of you have said Applebee's in the past. Is this still the case? I've read that Cheesecake Factory has ""world-class training."" Anyone know much about this? It also seems cutthroat, though. They could axe you if you're ""not up to their standards.""

This is from those distant, mist-veiled days of the mid-'90s, but it was when I was still serving. I don't often get to tell this story, but it's one of my favorites from that part of my life.

So I worked at a local steakhouse which was an institution back home. It had been there for 25 years by the time I started working there, and we often saw kids come in for prom whose own parents had done the same when they were in high school. (I feel certain that most non-Americans are familiar with prom thanks to films, but for those who aren't prom is typically a big dance to celebrate the end of the school year. It's generally organized by, and is often restricted to, those in the final two years of high school—students aged 17 or 18, for the most part.) During prom season, things were crazy for a couple of consecutive weekends. Adults who would have liked to grab themselves a free meal or six would sometimes decide to take advantage of the general chaos of prom season as a means of helping them do so. I had had a couple of checks walked over the years, but never at that restaurant. I was vigilant. (Having to cover a $200 check that didn't get paid acts as a great motivator never to allow that to happen again. \[Edit: I see from several comments that this makes it seem as though I had been required previously by this restaurant to cover a walked check. That happened at my first waiting job, at a corporate chain. No one who worked at this restaurant was ever required to cover a customer's theft. Apologies for the confusion.\]) No one had ever tried as brazenly as the couple I'm about to tell you about, though. Before we get too far into the story, though, it's important to describe the set-up of the restaurant itself. It matters to the story.

At this restaurant, one walked in the front doors directly to the host station. From there, guests could either walk straight ahead to the bar, or if they were arriving for their reservation on time we would lead them down a long hallway to their left. This hallway ran nearly the length of the building, minus the bar, and branched off into four separate dining rooms. At the far end of the hallway to one side was the entrance to the kitchen. Both sides of the hall were lined from one end to the other with our wine selection—reds and ports to the right, whites and sparkling to the left. So this was not the sort of place where one might run without attracting lots of attention, to say the least. Now, to the story.

I was working a station in the dining room at the far end of the hall on the right, so when I walked out of the back of the house I couldn't see my station without physically walking into the room, and I couldn't see the two-top without turning my head. It wasn't our biggest station. I didn't have the seniority for that, but it was a decent four-table station which included two six-tops, a four-top, and a two-top. The couple—both relatively attractive, well-dressed, and I guessed about 10 years older than I was—who star in this story were sat at the two-top. They weren't especially demanding. In fact, they had been downright patient considering I had sixteen dolled up teens at my other three tables.

I was a strong server and knew how to control my tables without it being obvious or off-putting, which is why I had that job in the first place, so even with my station filled as it had been that night I was busy but hardly overwhelmed.  (We had great support staff, as well.) After showing up at my table with cocktails in hand (not unusual but they were added to the check I handed guests unless they settle up at the bar before being seated in the dining room), ordering starters, a couple more cocktails, entrees with a bottle of decent red, dessert, a bottle of port, and coffee, they waited until just before I had to bring separate checks (yes, we let the prom kids do that even though we didn't allow anyone else to do it for more than a single split and never for any table larger than a four-top) for my two six-tops and asked if they could get their check before I had to take care of that task. Of course, I obliged since I had their check ready to go. I thanked them for coming and told them I hoped to see them again soon. Then, I stepped out of the room and into the kitchen. That's when they decided to strike, and it's also when they clearly showed that they had not familiarized themselves with our procedures.

Take note for a moment that I said I needed to *bring* separate checks, not that I needed to *prepare* separate checks. We had a cashier who sat right up front by the door (like I said, old school place). They had to walk right past her to get to their table. Everyone did. She wasn't exactly conspicuous, but one wouldn't need to turn one's head to see her either. Except, it seems they had either missed her being there or they simply didn't put things together. You see, the entire time I worked there, I never once prepared a check of my own. I put in the order to the kitchen, but when it was time for a check I would drop the order ticket on her counter. She made certain that everything was correct, printed up a check, placed it in a booklet, and put the booklet in the rack for that particular station. We would see our number light up above the kitchen entrance to let us know it was ready. That couple had camped a bit, which had given me a chance to get ahead of things, and that was their ultimate undoing.

As mentioned, I popped into the kitchen, and they clearly took note of which direction I turned. They then waited a moment to begin casually strolling out. When I stepped back out of the kitchen a moment after that, I just caught sight of them turning the corner to walk out of the place. There was no indication that my separate checks were ready, so I walked over to my section and the second I saw the table I had a strong feeling something was wrong. The booklet with their check was on the table exactly where and how I had left it. That's not necessarily a guarantee that they had ignored it, but they would have had to leave cash since I hadn't taken a card from them. Sure enough, he had done nothing more than write, ""Too bad. So sad."" on the check with a frowny face. I scooped up the booklet, dropped it in my apron pocket, and started speed-walking down the hall toward the front door. As I was passing the cashier, I noticed that the manager, Vernon, was right there and quietly told him a check was walking right that second as I was cruising past. Like I said, this is the sort of place where one does not run, and even a speed-walk is going to attract *some* attention. Vernon signaled that he understood and I kept right on cruising out the door just in time to see them waiting at the valet station. (We didn't normally valet, but prom season didn't result in as many limo rentals back then and parking got scarce quickly.)

The moment I saw them I said, ""Excuse me, sir."" He ignored me. I spoke a little louder still walking toward them. He still ignored me. I hadn't said anything about the check up until then. It's unlikely that someone could walk a check by accident, but we at least had to pretend that was a possibility. After the second time of being ignored, and just as their new, red Mercedes pulled up, I said quite loudly, ""Excuse me, sir, but you neglected to pay your check!"" He never turned toward me despite the fact that I was getting close, but he said something to his companion as he held open her door, who giggled as she seated herself, and walked around to get into his car. His companion couldn't stop herself from looking a bit flustered, and we briefly made eye contact. I knew what was up, but she had no idea what I was about to do.

As my fellow servers can attest, the last thing one wants to do is fuck with a server when the solution to such fuckery requires nothing more than pen and paper. Servers *always* have both. I also generally kept a fat Sharpie in my apron pocket, as well. Never know when you might need one, and I had just found the time. So I walked about 10 feet in front of their car—still on the curb because a walked check isn't worth dying for, for fuck's sake—whipped out my Sharpie and pad, jotted down his tag number in big characters, and looked up just in time to see him put his car in gear and give me the biggest shit-eating grin he could possibly muster. I just held up my pad and slowly tapped it with the back end of my Sharpie as he passed me. That grin didn't last. He stopped a few feet past me, and I walked up to his window. He didn't roll it down, so I just leaned over and said loudly, ""You can either deal with us or the police. Your choice."" He put the car in park, glared at me from the other side of the glass, and started to get out. I got the feeling he was going to try to intimidate me, but he never got the chance. Just at that moment, Vernon walks up and who's walking right behind him but the owner.

Now, even on a busy night, I knew when the owner was on site. We all liked Mr. Ross. He chose us, personally, as his wait staff, and he always had our backs. He took care of his, and when he was around for a service he would come chat with us individually, just catching up. So I was surprised to see him.

He walked up to me nonchalantly and said, ""Hi, jshubbub. How is your service going this evening? Everything good?"" I was a little unsure of where he was going, but I played along by replying, ""Everything has been great until just a moment ago."" Mr. Ross, clearly play-acting at this point, looked taken aback and asked what the matter could possibly be. I simply nodded toward the guy trying quite unsuccessfully to look as though he was being severely put upon and said, ""This gentleman had an issue with his bill."" Then I excused myself to go back to my tables, but Mr. Ross stopped me, told me they were being seen to, and asked me what I meant. The guy decided that then was the time to make his play, but Mr. Ross simply held up his hand to indicate to him that he should probably hold his tongue without looking away from me and asked me to explain. I did.

Mr. Ross took a beat as though he was considering matters, and then he turned to the guy who clearly expected to be given the opportunity to give a different story. Instead, Mr. Ross asked, ""Was something wrong with your meals?"" The man answered quickly, ""No."" Before he could say anything else, Mr. Ross asked, ""Was something wrong with our service?"" The man answered even more quickly, ""No, but I received an emergency call and we left without realizing we hadn't paid our bill yet. I was just going to explain the situation to jshubbub, but he started threatening to call the police before I could."" It was odd to hear about the call because, as mentioned, this was the mid-'90s. Mobile phones weren't small at that point. If they weren't hard-wired into your vehicle then they had to be carried around in a shoulder bag that looked as though you were planning to order a nuclear strike. They were quite uncommon and enormous, and if he had taken a call on a mobile phone at his table then it would certainly have been noticed. Hell, even if he hadn't received a call, the phone would have been noticed. It had not been.

Mr. Ross, just reeling out the rope this guy was hanging himself with as fast as he possibly could, innocently asked, ""You received an emergency call on our phone?"" The man said no, but he didn't elaborate. In fact, he clammed up. Everyone there knew he had taken that fateful step too far by lying about a phone call, but Mr. Ross wasn't letting up. Rather than carrying on with another leading question, Mr. Ross kept looking the guy in the face without saying a word. Just letting the guy stew in it until it was clear that the beads of perspiration on his forehead were not, in fact, due to the warm evening. It was then that I remembered that I had the guy's check in my apron pocket. I had been so fascinated by what was unfolding in front of me that it hadn't occurred to me until right then.

I pulled the booklet out of my pocket, opened it, and handed it over to Mr. Ross. He looked it over carefully, and you could see the look of panic start to creep over check walker's face. Finally, the guy can't take it any longer and admits that they had walked out without paying, but he claimed to have done it because he had forgotten his wallet and didn't want to be embarrassed in front of his date. Mr. Ross gave him another long look, glances back down at the check, reads out loud ""Too bad. So sad."", and just as the guy decided he needed to say something in reply Mr. Ross jumped in and said, ""You do know that if I call the police, and it turns out that you have the means to pay your bill in your possession, things are going to go very badly for you, right? I will press charges, and I will see that you're prosecuted. I'll make time for it.""

At that point, the guy knew he was caught, but you could still see him trying to come up with a way out. Then I heard the weariest voice I had ever encountered up to then in my still relatively young life as the woman in the car said, ""Just pay the goddamn bill. I'm ready to go home."" We all looked over at the car, then back to each other, and the guy reached into his jacket pocket to pull out his wallet. Mr. Ross, however, stopped him as he began to open it. ""Your check comes to $304.77."" (Yes, I still remember it. That comes to just over $508 in today's money.) Then he went on, ""You will pay your bill in full, right now, and you will tip jshubbub 20%. That is non-negotiable."" Check walker gets a look on his face and says, ""I've only got hundreds."" Mr. Ross let out an actual laugh, turned to me, and said, ""jshubbub, it looks like you're getting more than 20% on this check."" The walker clearly did not like this turn of events, but he was screwed. He pulled out four $100 bills and handed them over to Mr. Ross. He thought Mr. Ross was done with him. So did I. We were wrong. Mr. Ross stopped the man before he could get back into his car and said, ""We're not finished.""

Mr. Ross then pulled a damn loupe out of his pocket, along with a pen light. He handed the light to Vernon and told him exactly how to hold it. Then he set about closely examining the bills very seriously. After carefully checking each of them, he tucked the loupe in his pocket, took the pin light from Vernon, put it in his shirt pocket quite deliberately, and turned his attention back to our check walker. He gave him the beat he had been using to torment the poor bastard since the whole thing began and then said, ""All right. We're done, but you are not welcome here again. I don't want your business. I don't want your family's business. I don't want your friends' business. If you return, I will have you arrested for trespassing. I have a photographic memory, and I will remember you."" (He really did. It was uncanny.) Mr. Ross didn't get a response so he asked, ""Do you understand?"" The guy said he did. Mr. Ross then leaned down to speak to the woman in the car and asked her if she understood. She said she did. Mr. Ross told them to leave immediately, and we watched them go.

Mr. Ross told me later that his father had been a banker who insisted that his son learn the business. Apparently, by the time he was 10 his father would have him at the bank every day during school breaks, and he would require Mr. Ross to confirm the authenticity of bills until he got better at it than his father's employees. (Banking was different back in the day.) He also admitted that he didn't need to check the bills as long as he did. He knew immediately that they were authentic, but he had no problem fucking with people who tried to steal from him.

tl:dr: Well-dressed couple thought they could get a free meal by coming on a night when we would have lots of kids out for prom and casually strolling out after I dropped the check. They didn't expect the owner to be there. Or to confront them personally. Or to fuck with them while doing so. Or to have a photographic memory, in case they decided to try for a little payback in the future.

Edit: Holy crap. Two silver, a gold, and (now two) platinum. The two silvers were unprecedented for me, as well as unexpected. I'm stunned over the gilding and the platinum. Thank you all, kind strangers.",0,"Oh, you thought you'd take your chances on a little dine &amp; dash, did you?",3002

I often get a large-ish takeaway order from a local restaurant. It includes 8 different containers and I want to tip for that effort.

Customers have to manually override that screen in order to complete the transaction, leaving no tip at all. It's the same when ordering online.

This all or none behavior annoys me every time. I have to believe that the restaurant can program their danged terminals any way they want, including a screen that allows customers to enter a specific amount for the tip. (Notably, this type of terminal is only at the takeout counter. Dine-in customers get a standard paper receipt with a line to enter the tip amount.)

I end up cancelling the preset tip on the terminal and handing over cash, but in this restaurant the takeout cashier may not even be the person who packaged the order.

TLDR at end

A little bit of context i work at a Mexican bar and grill, we are in all essence a Mexican Subway and as such we pride ourselves on the speed of service as well as the quality of our food. In our store we buy large 5 Liter (about 1.3 gallons) tubs of sour cream that we then water down (this will be important later) so it's easier to spread over the customers meal.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the story,

it's a normal day haven't been to busy just kinda chilling then the air became cold and in she walked an elderly lady not quite 80 but definitely not 50 if you feel, wearing this all cream outfit with this massive sun hat, i thought it was a little rude for her to be wearing a hat inside but  oh well, and these pure white fabric gloves that came up to her elbow...i knew i was in trouble.

Me: ""Hey how's it going?""

Lady: ""Small nachos""

that's a pretty strange way to feel

Me: ""No problem just the standard cheese, sour cream and guac?""Lady: ""Yes that should be fine""

&amp;#x200B;

I rang it up she paid and i'm walking away thinking man that actually wasn't bad...

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: ""Excuse me""Me: ""Yes, what seems to be the problem?""

Lady: ""Where's the sour cream?""

Me: a little confused as she had watched me put literally all three things on the nachos ""it's the white sauce..?""

Lady: *scoffs*  ""that's not real sour cream! i ate real sour cream when i was a girl! What's in it?""Me: ""nothing it's just sour cream..would you like me to make you another without that?""

Lady: ""of course i do!""

i go back and make her another one but as i ladle the Queso onto the nachos there's another problem

Lady: ""What's that??""

Me: ""It's our nacho cheese sauce..?""

Lady: ""i don't want that, where do you get your sour cream from?""

i tell her that i'm not sure and that i can check for her i head out back and find the tub i return and tell her

Lady: ""I want to see it.""

i'm 10 minutes from finishing my shift and i cant be assed arguing i leave and return with the tub.

Lady: ""open it.""

i sigh as i open the tub and tilt it so she can see in

Lady: ""i want that.""

i grab a spoon and scoop some onto the nachos.

Lady: ""what do you put in your sour cream""

Me: ""just water to make it-"" she cuts me off

Lady: ""My goodness i don't want **\*my area's\*** water they poison it don't you know!?""

327,JustDraggingAlong,0,t3_bhfw0i,12,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bhfw0i/a_rather_peculiar_1_top/,"  So this happened to me a bit over 8 years ago. At the moment i was working at a rather large Central Asian (Uzbeki) restaurant in NYC. My first A La Carte gig, before i was working banquettes at a posh Russian Super Club here in Brooklyn. I was really content with my the job at the time, i was making decent money and kind of gotten myself into learning about cooking, wine, bar and bartending.

But anyways, back to the story. It was Tuesday, my last day of the working week (I was on Friday through Tuesday) around 7 pm. In comes a lone dude, normal looking, greeted me and seated him. He right away ordered a green tea, which is an absolute must with every meal in Uzbek cuisine, and a quadruple shot of Hennessy VSOP. He further ordered a salad, soup, a hot appetizer and main course, asked me not to rush his order and bring everything out one by one.

   So, the night goes on, the gentleman received his salad and was just sitting there, not taking a bite. So a few minute go by, I asked him whether there was something wrong with the order to which he said that everything was delightful. Next i bring out his soup and hot appetizer. Same as before, he is just sitting there, sipping that damned green tea, not touching his food or even the Henny. Im kinda weirded out by then, approach him again to ask if he is enjoying everything and if there is anything wrong with the food. To which his reply is that everything is delicious. By now, i have told about the fella to a few of my coworkers and we kinda keep an eye on him, dude just sits there sipping the fucking green tea, he ordered an entire pot of it so there was plenty to just sip.

After another 25 minutes I brought out his entree, set it in front of him, wish him Bone Appetit and get on my way, watching him very subtly from afar. And what the fuck do you know? The motherfucker just sit there with that fucking nonchalant look on his face, sipping the damn tea.

Another 20 minutes roll by, he still hasn't touched anything, but the tea. Next time i walk past him, he asks me for our dessert selection. I tell him about our dessert selection, all he orders is vanilla ice cream, I roll it out, move the untouched main dish out of the way (its was not a busy night so he was seated at a 4 top, so there was plenty of space to move uneaten food around), place the ice cream and fall back.

Yet another 20 minutes, ice cream by this point is all melted with him not touching it, he finally asks me for a check. At that point i was really curious how things will go from then on. I presented him with the bill, inquired whether he enjoyed dining at our glorious establishment , to which he replied that he was very content with his experience. After denying me to wrap anything in a doggy bag for him, i left him to pay the bill and went to my corner to watch him. He looked at the bill briefly, pulled out wallet, put in cash, got up, on his way out thanked me for everything and just left. I went over, picked up the check book, the bill was 95$ and there was 150 in the book…

  To this day i keep wondering what the actual fuck. I mean its not a big deal. But still, i think about it now and then. The guy looked absolutely normal, just deep in his thoughts and was really polite. May be some you you fellow servers had something of sorts happen to them, or could help me elaborate his behavior, i would be very thankful.

  TLDR; lone guy came in on week night, ordered whole lot of food. Ended up not touching a single item on his plates, just drank his green tea, was polite, refused to get anything wrapped up, left over 50% tip and left, leaving me flabbergasted to this day.",0,A rather peculiar 1 top.,50

&amp;#x200B;

So this was one of those surreal work moments where your only reaction is a sort of blank faced what tha fuck but I still sometimes think of this man and his apparent woes. I (24F) bartend at a tiny local bar and restaurant that's been a community cornerstone since the 70s. I was on dayshift a few months ago when this man comes up to the carryout area. I ask him what he needs and he starts explaining how there was a charge on his credit card from our restaurant from the previous day for $8.56, the exact cost of an order of our breadsticks and famous dip at the time, and the man says he wasn't in recently and his wife was supposed to be in a town 45 minutes away at a mall all day yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I assume he's just a sort of clueless older man who somehow thinks I can help him with his possible identity/credit theft so I ask him if he's seen other suspicious activity on his card to which he enthusiastically replies YES!! I say if so that's a huge red flag and he needs to contact his bank about immediately because cards are stolen all the time. He starts to backtrack a bit at this point and starts inquiring about if we have security cameras. I say yes but I'm not in charge of them or the recordings. He asks me to get my boss to check the tapes from the timestamp indicated on the charge to see who was using his card.

&amp;#x200B;

I say I could ask, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to find the exact time as the timestamp might be different or what have you. He pushes a little more and I say I'll certainly inform my boss about this and ask him to check but I can make no guarantees as I just work here. His tone starts to change now and he gets a little irked. Starts saying how I need to check the cameras and see who it was ASAP. He then pulls up a Facebook photo of a woman and says ""If you see this woman on the recording with another man, you need to call me immediately. If you see her, I know she's been lying and messing around. I've been seeing weird stuff on my card and you need to tell me if you see my wife!""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I realize the man probably never suspected theft at all and instead was trying to manipulate me into confirming and agreeing with him that his wife was lying to or cheating on him. I feel like he really wanted me to rally with him that his wife was probably messing around and he seemed to get upset when I kept saying to contact his bank if he's seeing suspicious charges. I take down his name and number and tell him we'll call if we find anything, but I'm not sure what we could find. He starts walking to the door but turns on his way out and says, ""And you better not lie to me either!"" Like what the hell man? When did I join into your terrible marriage?

&amp;#x200B;

I relayed the whole goings on to my no nonsense 75 year old owner/boss and he laughed for a good five minutes and said he would never be calling that man, but I think he still reviewed the security tapes for the day in question, finding nothing of interest. Bartending is so interesting, like a free cable TV drama I get to participate in.",0,"Sir this is a restaurant, not To Catch a Cheater's production offices",129

Me: “Mixed veg, roast potatoes and mash.”

Her: “Oh I don’t want any veg.”

Me: “No veg at all?”

Her: “None whatsoever.”

Me: “That’s absolutely fine, would you like anything else instead?”

Her: “More roast potatoes.”

Now let’s overlook the fact that potatoes are a vegetable, and get to the fact that she repeated about five more times after I finished taking her order that she wanted no vegetables with her meal. She would do so much as to cut over me and other people who were ordering to make sure I knew she wanted NO VEGETABLES.

Now I know what you’re thinking, that’s the end, she just wanted no vegetables, but it’s never that easy is it?

Me (after reading the order back): “Is that everything?”

Her: “Excuse me?”

Me: “Yes?”

Her: “I don’t want any veg with my roast chicken.”

Me: “Yep, I have that written down, you want extra roast potatoes instead.”

Her: “Exactly, and could I please get carrots?”

330,renaultbass,0,t3_bh2x1f,43,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bh2x1f/fuck_cheeseboards/,"Just before we opened yesterday, the manager of the bar three doors down swung by to let me know he had a booking of 15 tonight but that their pizza oven was on the fritz so had told the group that they could order and collect pizza from us.

This has happened a few times before when they’ve had staffing issues or an order too big for their kitchen, usually the manager rings with an order and one of them comes to pay and collect. Easy money. Just to make clear, we are not the same business, this is very obvious to anyone.


Yesterday, no call came. We were exceptionally dead so the chef was mid closedown trying to get away quickly. Just before we decided to actually close, a girl from the group next door comes in to place the order so the chef perks up a little.

She places an order for one small charcuterie board with no meat. Just three bits of cheese, some chutney and pickles. She doesn’t want to substitute the meat with extra cheese. She doesn’t eat bread so no crackers. I let her know we don’t usually sell these for takeaway so we would need to package in a pizza box and it won’t look how it usually would; particularly with the lack of meat. She says that’s fine so I let her know it’ll be ready to collect in 5 minutes. I discount her 10% for the deductions as our till doesn’t let us remove certain items. This is when she gets a little pissy.

“Collect?! Why can’t you bring me it, it’s only a few doors away, should it not be less if it’s takeaway too?”

Unfortunately I was by myself  FOH so I couldn’t really leave the bar. Also, fuck doing that.


At this point, I also let her know we are closing in 30 minutes so if her friends are hungry, they need to order soon.


She’s pissed but comes back bang on time to collect her cheese. As she’s leaving, she asks if we have cutlery. I tell her no but I imagine next door will. She then goes to take a can with cutlery in it off one of my tables and leaves. 6 knifes and 6 forks for three bits of cheese.


About an hour later, as I’m practically locking the door. Her friends show up and asked to order pizza.


This morning we get a review with a photo of the cheeseboard (I told her it would look shit!) complaining that she only got such a small portion, that we should deliver food to the table, that we should have checked with the entire group (once again, at their table, in a bar three doors away) if they wanted food and that “my lack of knowledge of my other venue is shocking” She is demanding that we cater their next event (once again, in another bar) for free as an apology.

331,FallenDead667,0,t3_bh97da,10,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bh97da/learn_to_control_your_kids_and_learn_some_manners/,"I am a part time waitress at a pizza restaurant in my city and as the location of the restaurant is slap bang in the middle of the city centre, we get a lot of people rush in around lunch time as we have an unlimited pizza buffet from 11am - 3pm Sunday to Friday and the price of the buffet itself is rather cheap, £7.50 for unlimited pizza, pasta and salad. Usually its people on their lunch break coming for a bite to eat before going back to work, parents with small children to come in and eat as well as shoppers coming in for a break from their shopping spree. 

It was a Sunday morning, this was when the buffet for Sundays was from 11:30am till 5pm, annoying considering the lunch rush ended at 2-3pm, but anyway. At around 1:30pm, a group of 12 people came in, bearing in mind that the restaurant is tiny, we have round 35 tables in the restaurant, (we can fit 40 if we remove the buffet bar, but we only do that around Black Friday and Christmas).

As that group of 12 came in, my manager on shift, began to shuffle around tables in the back section for all of them to fit. Amongst that group of 12, there was 5 adults and 7 kids, at least 4 under the age of 8. 

Luckily I was the buffet host for today (This is where I keep an eye on the pizzas on the buffet bar, are they still looking nice, are they fresh and removing the empty pans when there's no slices left. As well as keeping the self service areas clean, like the buffet bar, salad bar and the unlimited drinks machine which is all in a close proximity.) and the back section is just behind the small wall we have in place to divide the buffet and salad bars from where the tables were. 

My co-worker took the group to their table and sat them down, explaining all the deals and the buffet to them briefly and that they'll be back to take their order. Before they even got a chance to walk away and attend to their other customers as it had picked up a little where everyone wanted to pay at once, the kids of the group, especially the young ones, began to make a lot of noise. Queue me thinking ""Oh no..."" 

I was very lucky in that I didn't have to serve anyone that day as just seeing that table made me stress. I suffer from social anxiety and a couple other mental health issues, so the children making a lot of noise began to put me on edge a little. But considering I was at work and have been told in the past to ""Keep a smile on my face as it upsets the other servers and customers"" I had to fake my smile to them as they could see me quite well walking in and out our enclosed bar to the buffet bar. 

As our kitchen is upstairs, we have lifts to transfer the food from one floor to another, so I kept heading back and forth from the lifts in the bar area to the buffet bar cart. The group could clearly see me carrying hot pans of pizza and pasta sauce to and from the two locations every 3-4 minutes or so, as it was mid rush for the buffet. 

As they ordered, I heard they all ordered our buffet, fair enough, it is worth the price it is, as well as our unlimited drinks, again fair enough. But as they all got up to get their food, thats where I had to store a load of pizzas through the main terminal to go to the kitchen to be made, considering they all practically cleared out the pans that were on the bar. 

As more and more hot pans were coming back and forth from the buffet bar, I was getting more and more worried. Now, as they group were all sat down to eat, there was this little girl, she couldn't have been more than say 6, she was absolutely tiny, about 2ft tall, but she would not stay at the table. She would walk around the buffet bar constantly, around the salad bar and run around the restaurant bare foot may I add, she would go around picking out from the salad bar with her saliva covered hands, which stressed the hell out of me considering I had to keep removing some product and putting fresh product in the crocks to keep it clean, as well as clean the tongs in them. 

But she kept running into others as they were around the buffet bar, which meant she almost ran into me, carrying the hot pans, I almost dropped them on her a couple of times and it was honestly beginning to freak me out. My manager and store manager who had come down to talk to the manager could see I was getting stressed and instantly knew the cause as they saw the little girl running around. 

By the time the table finished their food, the kids went to get their ice cream, with the Sunday buffet, its a little different where you can get a bundle so the kids can have a drink and the ICF included. (ICF stands for ice cream factory) They all went for their ice cream, including the little girl. The other kids get their ice cream and sits down, where as the little girl, gets hers and runs around with it. 

Now at this point, I finally stepped in and told her not to run around with ice cream as she could lose her ice cream and that she didn't want that. The girl glared at me and ran back to the table where she told her supposed mum who then began glaring daggers at me. I just continued doing my job and ignored the glares to my best effort despite me feeling very uncomfy for the rest of their time in the restaurant. 

However, she began running with it again and low an behold, she tripped over someones foot and spilt her ice cream everywhere, some even splashed up and landed on a fresh pizza I just put out, so I had to take it back into the bar.

The mother yelled at me as if I was the one at fault and demanded I clear it up, which I did considering it was all over the floor near the buffet bar and it was my responsibility to clean it, not because she demanded me to. 

Eventually they paid and left our restaurant, but they left the back section in a complete state! rubbish and food scraps all other the floor, sauce and food scattered all over the tables, spilt drinks, ripped drinks menu and cutlery thrown around. I had to clean that up myself as well as managing the buffet bar. It took my 20 minutes to get it all clear and set. 

Soon after this, my store manager let me go home early as buffet had died down and the restaurant was very quiet, so he took over for the last 2 hours of my shift. 

Seriously woman, learn to control your hell spawn of a daughter, she almost could've been seriously burned and I would've felt incredibly guilty knowing I could've burnt your daughter!

I just needed a place to vent before I decide if this is something I should take to r/legaladvice but for now i’m just heated. I really can’t tell if i’m making sense right now so if this isn’t as big of a deal as I’ve made it, I’ll calm down soon and see it. But this is just the last of many straws for me. 

I’ve worked at a small, family run greek restaurant for two years now. The owner and his brother are some of the worst people I’ve ever met - mysoginistic, rude, no concept of how to run a business much less a restaurant, cheap, overtly mean to customers, did I mention rude? The brother is a cook and actually berates the customers over their orders if they have substitutions or something. I’ve had to apologize MULTIPLE times because he is bitching about customers in our kitchen and can easily be overheard. The owner is never at the restaurant except to drop off food he’s bought. He will not fix any of the issues with he building, like the AC unit that rains on people or the wall that leaks or the broken mirror in the women’s bathroom. All he does is come in with his friends on nights when there’s a game at the nearby university, and eats his own food and drink his own beer and then complains that the shop isn’t making money and cuts back the server hours. Not to mention the kitchen is convinced he pays off the health inspector and I am too. Great guy. 

The person who really runs things is the FOH manager, T. She honestly is more of an owner than the owner is. She runs the whole place and the customers all know and recognize her. She’s often even shelling out HER OWN money, without being compensated, for repairs or new silverware or things the owner refuses to buy. The women’s bathroom had a hole in the wall the size of a large menu with only duct tape covering it and she hired someone to fix the whole thing. It’s ridiculous but I digress. 

We’ve been working with a rather crappy system for some time, the Clover system. Idk if it’s crappy because it’s old or the company isn’t great but either way it’s a hassle. 

Well last night, apparently it came to the attention of someone (no idea who exactly bc communication between the staff and owner is stupidly nonexistent) that if you do not hit ‘done’ at the end of the transaction, it voids the entire transaction and our tip. This is extremely problematic, as there are many ways to get out of the transaction screen besides the “done” button. While I have never seen any evidence of this (and frankly am not sure of its validity since none of the servers seem to have noticed this either), it apparently means that the restaurant and our servers are losing money. Not good, right? Owner might want to change the system right? Maybe offer some compensation or a solution so it stops happening, right?

Wrong. 

This is the message we were all sent - not by the owner himself but rather through the grapevine of our manager and our group text: 

‘To all servers:

I am sure by now and I hope by now you have been told about the issue we had we some of the credit cards not being paid and accidentally being voided out. The mistake has cost both you and I lots of money. 
I will try to collect some of it but not all. 
So, effective immediately, any accidental voids that have not been authorized by me or Yanni will be your expense. You are responsible to make sure all transactions are paid properly. At the end of every payroll I will be pulling voided reports (hopefully will not find any) to check what was voided. The report will show me if mine or (brothers)  number was used if so, the void was done correctly  if not then it means it wasn’t and you will be responsible to pay it. 
I will not be charging the costumer for something that was not their fault.’

After I talked to my fellow servers and manager, I realized that no, he does not plan on ever changing the system. We cannot view the voided reports, so we have no way of knowing if anything has been voided. We cannot even get to the void screen without their personal PIN. And to top it all off, some of us are skeptical that this is even why certain transactions are being voided. Quite frankly, the owner doesn’t even know how to put in an order on our POS (trust me - I had to teach him, a year into my employment). I don’t exactly trust his computer diagnostic skills. 

So basically, if a customer comes in and orders food, pays for said food, and the system voids the transaction, I not only lose my tip but I also have to pay for their entire bill. Oh, and can i check to make sure something wasn’t voided? No. So the owner just gets to check over the void sheets we can’t see and decide how much money he gets to collect from us? Yes. OH! AND DONT FORGET! We only have two portable tablets and are often very busy and pass these tablets among servers to take payments and orders. So I’m responsible for my money, the customers, the restaurants, and my coworkers, and I have no way of keeping track of any of it. Cool. 

If he wasn’t already fucking us over and asking us to say thank you, now he refuses to even text or call us himself. I tried to send him a message and call him but he has turned his phone off or just sending me to voicemail. Lovely. Maybe i’ll catch him at work- oh wait. He never comes into his business! right.

Almost every spring break I had, my parents would take me and my younger sister to Sanibel and Captiva, Florida. On the third trip there, my cousin had moved in with us because it was an easier commute for him to go to work. My parents booked one more ticket for him to go with us, but a few weeks before we went, he had a few meetings for work that week. We instead invited our neighbor/friend's kid (F) to come with us. She came with us. Now, on to the story.

On the third or fourth day there, we went to a restaurant, only to find the hostess stand empty. About a minute later, the manager notices us and brings us to a seat. A quick thing about that restaurant, the first floor had outside or inside seating. The second floor was the same, only with a balcony. My dad said something to the manager about the lack of a hostess and then waves over to my sis, our neighbor and I, saying how we could take the role of host/hostess. The manager agreed and said that we could get free ice cream if we did. The three of us happily complied, and we were sat on the second-floor balcony. We order our drinks and look over the balcony. An elderly couple was waiting at the hostess stand. My parents suggested that we take turns seating customers. We agreed and then our neighbor rushed down, greeted the couple and sat them. I called dibs on the next set of people.  Eventually, my time had come. A family of five walked up to the hostess stand. I ran down as fast as could and greeted them. The dad asked if I was old enough, and I just said, 'The manager let me'. He shrugged it off, and I seated them. As soon as I get back up, a family of four arrives. Now it's my sister's turn. She went and brought them to a table upstairs, with a smile. Another three groups came. A younger couple, a family of three, and a middle-aged couple.

The customers are ruder, the managers are ridiculous, going home at 2.30-3AM through a city is terrifying for me as I've nearly been mugged multiple times, the rotas are put up 1 week before the shifts instead of 3 weeks beforehand and my managers ignore the fact that I have 8.30AM uni lectures and still make me do shifts that end at 2 AM (I won't be in bed until 4 AM most of the time).

The rotas for this month were put up this week, and boom. I was put down for working the weekend I had booked off.

I greet the two guys, and we talk about how my name is from the Bible, I get their order and grab drinks. Later I mentioned a cute kid at one of my other tables, and they both ask if I want kids (no) a husband (yes) and if I’m religious. Weird conversation but I get all kinds so I just keep moving. They ask if they can pray for me and they leave, tip decently, it’s over, right?! WRONG. About an hour later, the host tells me I have an urgent phone call up front (I immediately thought it was something family related, emergency, etc) so I hurry to answer, and it’s the guy from my table. He saved the receipt, called the store and asked if I was allowed to get coffee with him sometime. I’m still processing on the phone, shocked, and I turned him down, telling him I’m not allowed to go out with guests and throwing in that I’m seeing someone for good measure. 
I just got out of a nasty relationship with a guy who told me for years that I was ugly and stupid and that he was the only one who would put up with me. So, while odd, that phone call was a huge confidence boost and I had a great shift. I know this was a rambling story but I wanted to tell someone, thought y’all might enjoy 😊

Settle in folks, because this is a LONG one. Also, mobile, and this happened a while ago, so sorry if that upsets people.

Bit of backstory: I’m a new server at a local sushi restaurant. This restaurant is extremely popular and has been in business for longer than I’ve been alive. It’s won awards and been in the news, the whole she-bang. It’s also a disaster to work for. I’m hired as a bartender, but they throw me on whatever FOH position they need. Server, host, anything. Even tho they never actually trained me. Just vaguely told me where most things were. 

(Cast: RC: Rude Customer, Me: obviously someone else, O: My boss, the owner)

Anyway, it’s a busy Saturday night, maybe my 3rd or 4th serving shift at this restaurant, and I’m seated a 5-top. A man, his wife, and their three kids. The kids and the wife didn’t talk to me much at all, and I have no problem with them. The man however, is the antagonist of our story. 

I greet the family as soon as I can, bring them their drinks, and politely thank them for their patience since we’re busy. (I’ve found that 99% of people are super forgiving if you just make it known that you’re doing your best.) The family is fine at first, if a little quiet. They order their food and all is good. For two of his kids RC orders soups, and him, his wife, and the oldest kid all get sushi. Cool. Easy.

Then, I made a mistake. At this restaurant, ALL entrees come with a miso soup and a salad, that the servers are responsible for preparing themselves. I’ll fully admit that it was my fault that I forgot that his kids soups came with other soups. I was new, having a soup and then another soup didn’t make sense to me, but whatever. 

Throughout the beginnings of their meal, RC makes eye contact with me while I try to serve other tables near them. After each time, I go over to him and politely ask him if there’s anything else I can get for him. Eventually, he flags me down, and I head over.

RC: Are my kids soups ever going to come out?

Since he had ordered soups, I naturally assumed he meant the actual meal, not the app miso. The restaurant was constantly slow, so I was already used to keeping guests calm while they waited way too long for their food.

Me: Since we’re so busy, the kitchen is probably just a little backed up, I’ll go check on the soups for you and I’m sure they’ll be out in a few minutes.

RC: Don’t the meals come with a miso and a salad? Where are those?

Me (realizing I totally forgot that was a thing): Oh, I’m so sorry I forgot that the soups came with those I’m new and still getting used to the menu. I’ll go and grab those for you right this second. 

I do just that, and bring them back two soups and two salads in at most a minute. RC is not at all pleased with this.

RC: Now, how can I trust these? I had to be rude to you to get you to get these, so I can I trust that these are good?

I had no idea what that meant, so I just tried to pull a solution out of my ass.

Me: If you’re worried they’re not hot, they’re fresh from the kitchen. But I’d be more than happy to go make you a new one if you’d prefer.

RC: No, I can see that they’re hot, there’s steam coming from the bowl, but how can a trust them to be good since I was rude to you to make you bring them.

Me (running entirely out of ideas): I didn’t think you were rude at all sir, and I’m sorry I didn’t bring the soups out sooner. But I can promise you that the soups are perfectly fine. I can still get you another soup if you’d like.

RC: No, don’t take the soup yet. I’d like to speak to the owner, M.

Since this place had been open so long, and the owner knew lots of regulars really well, I wasn’t overly surprised by this. So, I go and tell my boss exactly what happened, that it was my fault for forgetting, but that RC was very upset and I had no idea how to make it better.

M: Is there a problem here, RC?

RC: Yes. Me, here, forgot my kids miso’s and I had to be rude to them to get them to remember and now I can’t trust the soup they brought.

M: I promise you the soup is good. It’s fresh and hot. Would you like a new one?

RC: The soup isn’t the problem. How do I know that Me didn’t spit in my kids soup?!

Now, this angered me. I didn’t show it, simply apologized and explained that I would NEVER spit in a customers food, especially not in food for a kid, and that I didn’t think he was rude at all. Even though he was kind of rude to me before. He seemed satisfied with my answer, thanked me for apologizing, and my boss offered them dessert on the house. Everything was good, until it’s time for the check. 

I’ve made a habit of printing checks and carrying them on me for my last walk around to each table, just to save everyone a little bit of time. At worst, usually, people just don’t care about me already having the check, and at best, they’re happy about it. So, when RC asks for the check, I set it down on the side of the table where I’m at (by his daughter, who is 6 at most, as there are still some plates on the table, as well as no standing room on the other side, as we pulled an extra chair into an already tight 4-top to make it work) and go to work picking up their plates.

RC: Is my daughter going to pay for the meal?

Me: I’m sorry?

RC: Do you think my daughter is going to pay for the meal?

Me: No, sir?

RC: You have to put the check by the person who is paying for the meal. You can set it by me, or my wife.

I move to set the check down by him, having to maneuver around two other tables, and pick up plates to make room. 

Me: I’m sorry, there wasn’t any space over here.

RC puts a Groupon in the book and tells me he’ll give me his card after I take the Groupon off. Our general policy is that we take payment and discounts off together, but some people ask for the new check first, which is fine. I run his Groupon, and come back as quickly as possible.

RC: Of course I can’t even expect you to do one thing right. I need a pen.

Me: Usually people don’t need pens until after they pay-

RC: Just get me a pen. I need a pen to sign.

Me: I’m sorry, sir you haven’t paid-

RC: I need a pen.

I hand him a pen from my apron. He looks at the check for a minute, realizes that he doesn’t need a pen, puts his card in, and almost hands me the book. He gestures for me to lean over, and I will never forget what he told me. 

RC: You aren’t meant for this job.

Me: Excuse me?

RC: you aren’t born to be a server. Find a new career. Consider that your tip.

I run his card, give it back, and ask my coworker to watch my tables while I go to the bathroom. It takes me a few minutes to compose myself as his attitude and his words really got to me. I was only barely 19, and had only one serving job before that one.

Now I wish I had told him it was bold to assume being a server was more than a brief job option, and that the several people who I already had as my regulars after only a week would beg to differ. 

That man came back with his family almost every Saturday, and he had to sit there and watch as I made myself an invaluable part of that restaurant. I hope he always wondered if I spit in his beer from behind the bar. 

TL;DR I forget to bring the guys kids some side soups as a new server, so he tells me I’m not born to serve and should find a new career.",0,Man tells me “I’m not born to be a server.”,132
341,muffin_maid,0,t3_bgy916,20,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bgy916/tourist_nightmare/,"I’ve got stories for days so I’m real happy I found this subreddit.

Backstory. I worked at a busy Cuban restaurant in Daytona Beach, FL. Tourists suck and there’s a million of them. It was pretty common for the restaurant to be packed on weekends with an hour wait, even with a 100 seat cap restaurant. 

On this particular Saturday I was bartending, and a 16 top walked in on a whim. The host told them the wait would be 1 hour and they threw a fit saying they didn’t want to wait and refused to put their name down on the wait list. 

People from the group come to bar and ask me if they can take a takeout order then, and I look at them and explain politely that I cannot take their takeout as it will back up the kitchen and we weren’t taking to-gos. They leave the bar, and I don’t think about it as I was decently busy with my own work. The table happened to find a server, and she was inexperienced and took their takeout order. 

They found two empty tables and sat down, the tables were in sight of the bar. Meanwhile, I was making a shit ton of margaritas and other nonsense and setting them with their tickets for the servers to grab, when I realised that some were going missing. Servers were getting pissed that drinks weren’t being made when I could’ve sworn I’d already made them. It got to the point that I was missing up to 5 margaritas and a couple other drinks from the bar area that I remember clearly making. At this point there was an argument in the kitchen between servers and kitchen staff as well that their appetisers like guac and chips were also missing. The kitchen said the same thing where they swore they were making them but that they weren’t there. Out of the corner of my eye I see the table that the 16 top had decided to “claim” and see a mess of to go boxes everywhere along with several chips and guac baskets and drink glasses scattered throughout their mess. 

These people were literally stealing drinks AND appetisers from the windows (which were pretty easily accessible for customers, especially when the restaurant is packed and all servers are focused on their task at hand)!!! As soon as I realise this someone from the group walks up to the bar and says “what does it take it get a water around here” and I look him dead in the eyes and tell him, “I cannot serve you as I am not your server and you haven’t been sat by the host. If you want to be served please talk to the host and she’ll put you on the wait list.” 

My plan was to go find our owner to kick them out, but he wouldn’t let me leave. He started yelling at me that this was the worst service he has ever seen in an establishment and he doesn’t understand how they cannot be served as they are sitting at a table. I tell him that he needs to pay for his to go order and the drinks and appetisers he took from the bar and leave. This gets the man heated and people from his group come to the bar and start backing him up.  At this point I grab the phone and tell them I need them to pay and leave, and I’m going to call the owner. This angers the man and starts swearing at me all this nonsense. I tell him to quiet down and he literally starts to climb over the bar to me. At this point I take the phone and tell him I will call the police if he steps a foot further, I myself lowkey panicking on the inside. 

The owner was contacted at this point by another server and comes in, kicks them out without them paying their bill and tells them never to come back.

Their bill was over $100 just for their food, let alone approximately $20 in appetisers they stole and $40 in alcohol. Wtf.",0,Tourist Nightmare,289
342,screamtastic,0,t3_bgs3xg,47,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bgs3xg/industry_people_are_the_best/,"Cocktail shifts at my job are long. Many servers refuse to do them. Responsible for 12 tables where there's self-seaters and plus youre in typical rotation on top of it.

You show up at 3pm and immediately are running around cuz that's when day time happy hour starts until 6pm. Then from 6pm to like 730pm is the family dinner rush. 730 to 10pm can be the most boring time frame. Its the slowest. So slow to the point you just want to go home. 

But you have to stay for reverse happy hour which is 10pm to 2am, depending how busy the bar gets. Cuz when cocktail servers are cut, the 2 bartenders do both the bar and take tables. So its very unpredictable when youre leaving. 

You could be cut at 1030. Or midnight. Or even close. That's the final stretch no one likes cuz by 10 youre exhausted and just wanna leave. 

So its pretty slow tonight for reverse. Have no idea why I haven't been cut. I go out back to vape hoping I will be soon when bartender comes out and says, ""Hey you have 6 self-seaters at 210."" Mother. Fucker. No other tables in cocktail except them. 

So I go up to the table and one immediately says, 

""are you bartender or server?"" I reply, ""server."" 

""Are you going or wanting to be cut soon? Be honest""

""Yeah, I was hoping soon. Long busy day, been going at it since 3pm"" (it was midnight during this) 

""We got you, man. Hey, everyone lets just go up to the bar and grab our drinks, food orders and come back to the booth. Let's get this guy home."" 

I was shocked. I asked if they were sure and they told me where they worked and completely understand that when its almost time to go, you just want to go. 

Sure I could of made an extra $20 or 30 off them but you make so much before reverse starts you're usually content with just calling it a night. Was cut like 10 minutes after and was quickly able to head out.

Well there’s this vegan girl, most of the vegans who come here are super nice not pushy or rude if you don’t have an alternative. This girl comes in everyday and gets the same vegan tuna sandwich with vegan cheese. Well we’re out of a lot this week and I can’t help that. So today she was just an utter bitch.

So I was working the taqueria, she brought in her mom and she orders two mushroom tacos, meant to be served cold, she asks for vegan sauce and vegan cheese. 

M: I’m sorry we don’t have any vegan cheese today.

V: well you normally do.

M: Yes but we don’t have any right now we’re out.

V: well can I have vegan mayo?

M: No I’m sorry we don’t have that either.

V: Why don’t you have them you always have them?

We don’t have vegan sauce at taqueria ever so that was a lie.

M: Were out of a lot of stuff today, we just barely got our bread for deli today.

Vegan walks away in a huff, I go to talk to my friend working deli and vegan comes up and starts looking at all the options, when asked if she wants anything she says no just looking. She gets the same sandwich everyday, sourdough, vegan tuna, lettuce and mustard, she just didn’t want us to be talking.

So I go back to my station and I see her go back to deli, I was later told she said that the girl at tacos doesn’t know what she’s doing, can you heat these up? She wanted the whole plate in the oven and was told no, plus it’s only for deli foods so we wouldn’t have put the tacos in individually anyway, and she got upset and walks away and puts her tacos in the trash and comes back to me. 

V: The tacos were cold.
M: they’re supposed to be served cold I can’t heat  them up... she cut me off before I could tell her the grill isn’t vegan there’s cheese on it from making cheese quesadillas 
V:Do you know how to make a taco? You put the tortillas down and heat them up and you do the same with the mushrooms.
M: you need to not be rude to me right now
V: the customer is always right ma’am.
M: no they are not
I went to get my supervisor and tell him but I completely forgot she was vegan in the heat of it and he just said put the mushroom straight on the grill so I did.

I was freaking out about some personal stuff and exhausted from a few nights of insomnia last night, and ended up just leaving my house and driving around aimlessly. Finally I realized I also really needed to eat, and I pulled into a chain restaurant, one of the mall standbys that I tend to scoff at or meme about. It didn't even sound good, I just...needed to stop moving and stop feeling hungry, and it was there.

After I was seated I kind of just sat there and stared into space. No idea how much time passed, it could have been two minutes or half an hour, but suddenly my server was there introducing himself and asking if he could get me anything. I hadn't even looked at the menu, and so I said (roughly) 'hey, sorry, I've got no idea, I haven't slept and I'm a wreck right now, can you come back in a few?' Guy says of course, no problem, take all the time I need, goes to see his other tables, I space right back out again. I know, it's shitty of me to take up a table (and a server's time) while not ordering anything, all I can say is I was genuinely too far gone to realize that. My mouth was pretty much running on autopilot even while I was talking to him.

Of course he comes back, and I turn to apologize again for still not knowing what I'm doing with my life, but before I even can, he's giving me a glass of water, an appetizer I haven't even ordered, suggesting a (non-alcoholic) drink, telling me not to worry, he's not busy right now, he'll be here all night. The not busy right now, at least, is a blatant lie - the place is the size of a small grocery store, and pretty damn full for a weeknight, and seems shorthanded - I've seen basically no one else in uniform besides him.

I just about broke down, not gonna lie, but I managed to hold it together and thank him. The food was gone in about thirty seconds and he was still back with that drink before I was halfway done - he either made it in advance just in case, or stole it from another order, or he could fucking teleport. He vanished into the luminiferous aether again or whatever the fuck, and this time I managed to pull my head out of my ass long enough to pick out a burger to order. Of course I then spaced back out again and had to look at the menu to remember what I was ordering when he came back (with food and drink refills), but eventually I managed to tell him what I wanted.

I could go on but the whole night was like this. I must have been at that table alone for an hour and a half, with a bill that ended up being like $18 before tip, and he was as attentive and conscientious and caring as if I was getting bottle service at a starred restaurant. I showed up at this soulless monument to capitalism to get some calories in my body before it collapsed and left feeling loved and cared for and understood. Before I finally left, he told me he understood, he'd been there (and dear God, I've never worked as a server but I can only imagine you all have, given the open/close stories I've heard from my friends), I should just go home and get some sleep. And while I was sitting there trying to pull myself together to drive home safely, I was finally aware enough of my surroundings to notice him a couple tables away, being just as caring to a group as completely different from me as you could imagine in demographics, size, energy type/level, everything. 

Thank you, to Delfino, for treating me like family when I showed up and made your job harder. And thank you to all of you who are kind to strangers for crappy pay, in crappy environments, on not enough sleep. I know customers tend to suck, and as far as I'm concerned benign neglect is good enough service to be grateful for, I'm not trying to set this type of treatment up as any kind of standard. But I went from a danger to myself to making good decisions last night because a stranger took way better care of me than he needed to, and I'd feel weird and creepy trying to find him to thank him again personally (and the damn company's survey software timed out and locked me out when I took too long to remember his name), so I'm writing this here.

347,BootyUnlimited,0,t3_bh6ke6,2,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bh6ke6/country_club_experiences/,"I just wanted to get an idea of what working at a Country Club was like for some of you guys. I need to know if the type of behavior I witnessed was common or just an exception. I also would love to hear stories from other people who have experienced similar things to what I am about to say.

For me, the worst part of waiting tables at a Country Club was that as a waiter you basically become the (and forgive my language) ""bitch boy"" of the rude customers who decide to make your life hell. I would frequently get grabbed by the wrist when walking by a table. Rather than just asking me to stop or waving me over, I would literally feel a tug on my wrist or shoulder. Sometimes they would even pull me down to table level (so I could look them in the eyes I guess). The one specific example I am thinking of was this 40 something year old guy who thought he was absolutely hilarious. When he ordered from me he would pull me down to his level (after the first time I just decided to crouch so he would stop touching me) and ask with his beer breath for another drink or some food. The crowning moment was when he asked if my fake watch was real. I have a fake watch that if real would be worth around $5,000. That's a pretty penny, especially for me working a minimum wage job. So naturally I assumed he was joking and laughed while saying no. But he didn't laugh back, and I guess was offended at the idea that I didn't have a super expensive watch. He showed me his Rolex and told me it was gold. I pretended to act impressed before making an excuse to get going. Enjoy those $6 Bud Light's you dick.

Another common occurrence (besides being talked down to like you are the scum of the earth), is having to deal with little kids. In my opinion, they are often easier to deal with than their parents, who act like children themselves. But we still had our fair share of issues. Kids who would draw all over everything (we gave out crayons and paper upon request), loud crying or complaining, entitled kids asking how much I make or what car I drive so they can tell me how much their parents make, you know, the usual. One time a small child started peeing on the floor of the restaurant (outdoor patio section) and the mother simply moved him off the patio onto the grass. No issue that his bare butt was being flaunted around a bunch of eating customers. My favorite story with the kids was perhaps the one time I put my foot down and decided I was done being ordered around by 10 year olds. So we had this group of 5-6 10 year old boys who would frequently come to eat before going swimming. They were honestly fine most of the time, but I guess one of the boys thought he would be funny. So he ordered his food, and throughout the time I was there taking other orders he interrupted to change his order 5 times. I kept on saying ""sure"" and changing his order, but he would just change it again with a shit eating smirk. So I told him this would be the last time he could change his order as I was returning to the kitchen to enter it into the system. So he changes his order to one more thing, and I agree and leave. Queue a few minutes later when he comes up to me saying he really doesn't like what he ordered and was just trying to be funny. I told him I couldn't change it now (that was sort of a lie) and that he could always order something else. So he did, and ended up spending $15 more than he needed to. Every time after that he would never change his order :)

The last story I will tell is short, but is the most extreme case of server revenge I witnessed during my time working there. One waitress had just gotten yelled by a Karen type for bringing out the wrong plate of food. Little did Karen know (or care, probably) that this girl was just a food runner and the mistake was truly with the manager. After getting yelled at and crying in the kitchen, this waitress who will remain nameless took a glass of wine destined for Karen, and hawked a loogie in there that would make a Southerner wretch. (That means she spit into the wine for those who don't know). Then she took a knife, stirred it in, and served it to the woman with a smile. We all watched her drink it and nobody felt bad. I can't imagine it was the first time she drank somebody's spit at a restaurant. Plus I did not contribute and could simply say I saw nothing if questioned (never was).

The other day, I have two couples come in who I’ve seen before. Our show starts at 10, they come in about 5 minutes till show time so mostly everyone else is seated by this time. I get anywhere from 10-20 tables a show, and take them in the order they’re seated.

I get to this table as quickly as possible and grab their order (it’s very clear the show is sold out- over 200 people showing up at more or less the same time to see a show). I put their order in, but we only have two bartenders and at this point their drinks are at the back of a very long queue since they came in so close to showtime.

After I bring out their drinks, they hand me the comment card left on their table and I see they’re complaining that the service is so slow and more severs are needed (simply not true)

I bring them out a complimentary popcorn and thank them for their patience and apologize for the wait.  They look at me like I’m a complete idiot for doing so, act like they can’t comprehend the free popcorn and it’s a big stress on them?? Assuming the two couples are paying separate as they’re at two tables, I split the checks and am met with a big SIGH as if I’m the biggest idiot in the world.

first time poster, long-time lurker -love this sub

The restaurant I work at is a combo dinner/late night bar. Shifts can be long like 330-2am long and usually by 1, the entire staff is just ready to go home and pooched. Last week (when this happened) had been a particularly tough week for our work family and we were all just trying to get through the weekend. 

So at about 1:15, all of a sudden all the bartenders can hear water running, which is weird because as a bar, we have the music hella loud. Everyone kind of confused, looking around and then someone tries to go into the public men’s washroom and it’s like one of those video games where there is a hidden chamber behind a waterfall, like just gushing out. Within three minutes of us noticing this, our dancfloor, bar and front half of the restaurant is under three inches of water. And my manager is running around trying to find the water main to completely shut the water off. 

At this point, I’ve assumed we’re shutting down (because we are literally flooding) and some of the staff are putting boots on and trying to help get the water under control, while I turn on the lights and relay to the bouncers to get people out. The first hilarious encounter was a regular who annoys the crap out of all the servers and bartenders (rude, doesn’t tip, bad breath, very in your face) and as he’s being rounded out he goes(drunkenly): 
I’m a plumber, let me fix it, I’ll do it for free! 
And one our bouncers responds: 
Great! Hit us up tomorrow but tonight get out! 

The second encounter, that I came here to tell you fine people about, that in hindsight is funny but at the time really tested my patience was this: 

After herding the majority of people out (1:45ish), a few were left in the foyer area because it was a tad chilly by the coat check, but the bouncers were starting to pressure them to get out get out now. I hear a girl yelling and I think it’s someone screaming at our coat check girl (which is frustratingly normal) and my manager is still tryna deal with the water, so I go to check it out. I walk down and there is a girl leaning up against a wall, pretty drunk, yelling at our bouncers. 

(Me: yours truly/ Angry Girl:AG/ Bouncer:B)

Me: hey, what’s up guys? 

B(looking increasingly annoyed): oh just tryna get folks out 

AG: You can’t make me leave!! 

Me: we are literally flooding???? 

AG: I am going to be a lawyer, I’m pre-law at ~local university~, I know my rights. 

Me(who just got into law school and has been at our local uni for 7 years): lol, pre-law is just a pretentious way to say you’re in your undergrad [we don’t have a pre-law program here] you need to leave 

AG: I have the right to stay at this establishment UNTIL your officially posted business hours!!! 

Me (now bouncers are just physically corralling her outside): okay, HMU when you’re in law school and let me know how your law suit goes!!! 

After she left, I guess some moms messaged our owner about people being kicked out before close, but his response was basically the same, like am I crazy here, or do you want to stay in an establishment that’s flooding?",0,Restaurant Floods and Customer wants to stay...,195

Despite it being local and family ran it was popular and busy. Since we didn’t serve dinner the place is open 7am-2pm and the opening waitress had to get there at 6:30. I was always scheduled to open every weekend and would get there at 6:15 to make sure everything was prepped well. 

Fast forward to my grandpa passing away; I immediately contact my boss/the owner that I’ll need the weekend off so I could drive 12 hours to his funeral and come back. He begrudgingly said fine but I had to find someone to cover my shifts. I was pretty distraught and distressed, but I contacted everyone on the roster and of course no one took the weekend opener shifts. I told my boss that no one picked up the shifts, but I wasn’t going to miss the funeral. He was frustrated but said he’d sort it out. 

Fast forward to the weekend of the funeral. I get a call early the morning of the funeral. I always got along with the cooks and they were concerned when I didn’t show up at my usual early time. So one of them called me to make sure I didn’t forget my shift and get in trouble. I told him the situation and that the boss said he’d find someone else to open.  Obviously he didn’t bother getting someone to cover for me. I get back and of course the boss is irritated with me, even though I kept him in the loop with the whole process and did everything he asked and everything I could to help. He made it difficult for me to get any time off from that point on. And all the servers were pissed at me because without the opener the place was a hot mess, so no one wanted to cover future shifts of mine.  

I understood that it was short notice (he still had four days to work things out) and it’s hard to get people to take the crappy weekend shift, but come on!

Everyone on the TalesFromTheCustomer sub was incredibly angry for my feeling obligated to tip. I was basically just called an idiot and a moron over and over again. It got real toxic real fast. Am I crazy? Am I completely wrong here? Let me know what you think.

'It was around 9pm, I had just driven 7hrs, and I was hungry and tired. There's an Italian place a few blocks from my house that closes at 10pm so I figured I would place a pickup order online for some dang 'sghetti and meatballs. I was feeling basic as fuck, don't judge me.

Before I left, I called the place to ask if they could throw some parm in the bag.

ME: hi I placed a pickup order and just wanted to see if you could throw a side of parmesan in the bag.

GIRL: yeah...you could have just asked for that when you came in.

ME: oh...um...ok... does it by any chance come with a side salad? (A lot of italian places do that)

GIRL: no.

ME: oh ok no worries I just figured I would - *click* she hangs up

So I brush it off just thinking maybe they're busy. I work in the service industry too, so I understand that it can be difficult to always maintain a cheery demeanour with customers when shit hits the fan.

I get to the place and go up to the side of the bar that is designated for pick up orders. The whole restaurant is empty except for one family eating at a table. The girl behind the bar is wearing a snotty face that definitely personifies the voice on the phone.

ME: hi i'm here to pick up that order. \* points at the one brown bag on the counter \*.

GIRL, making exaggerated facial expressions in an attempt to patronize me: oH sO gOoD oF yOu To CoMe! HeRe YoU gO! \* makes that wide-mouthed, squinty-eyed, fake smile people do when they are trying to be aggressive through their teeth \*.

ME: ...is everything ok?

GIRL: OOH of course it is, \* looks at the receipt and says my name as she hands me the bag \*.

ME: ok...where do i sign?

GIRL: nothing to sign! Have a good one!

ME: oh, but i don't have cash and I want to leave the tip.

GIRL, extremely facetious at this point: oh don't worry about it! I'm SuRe you'll just get me next time, right!? I'm SuRe you really want to tip me!

(I should note that I have only eaten at this place once. Dined in and definitely tipped at least 20%, as I always do. Again, I also work in the industry)

ME, completely confused and frustrated: look, can I just buy something cheap with my card right now so I can leave a tip?

GIRL: doooon't worry about it, \* says my name loudly \*.

ME: no, i want to leave a tip. Seriously. Just let me buy the four dollar bread basket so i can leave a tip.

She finally agrees and walks back to the open kitchen. She makes a joke that is in inaudible to me and all the cooks look at me and laugh. I'm just standing there...trying to fucking tip her. She slowly saunters back over and drops a small ToGo box on the counter. The receipt is printed and I scribble out a huge tip. At this point I'm kind of shaken and just want to get out of there.

The girl gives another one of those fake smiles and says, ""Byyeeeee.""

The food was horrible. No sauce at all and the meatballs were burnt; like that kind of burnt that only happens when you overcook something in the microwave.

NEW NOTE: sort of related story to let you know why I place a lot of importance on tipping. I was bartending at my job recently and poured a $7 beer for this dude. He put exactly 7 dollars in cash down on the bar without realizing there was tax. So, already awkward about the fact that he didn't plan on tipping me, I had to explain to him that what he put down wasn't enough due to tax. He proceeds to reach into our tip bucket, pulls out a dollar, slaps it on the counter, and says, ""keep the FUCKING change."" He angrily scoffs and walks off with his beer before I can even respond.

I work at this nice little mom and pop owned restaurant right in the center of touristville in a big tourism city in Georgia, US. If you go through my post history it’ll be pretty easy to piece together so, fuck it, it’s in Savannah. It’s one of the nicer restaurants on the street and if you can deal with working just lunches for two years and manage to get up to serving dinner you can make some decent money, most of my coworkers are great and decent at their jobs and the ones that aren’t don’t really affect me much besides stealing the sauces I poured and set aside for my entrees ahead of time because I actually think ahead, that’s another rant in itself, moving on. There’s one bartender at my job that honestly just does not cut it. I’ve worked with bad bartenders, I’ve worked with new bartenders that take a little extra time, but my god I have never worked with anyone as slow with getting drinks out as this girl. She’s a nice person, I wish her no ill will, but holy lord when the bar is practically empty there’s no excuse for tickets to stack up 5+ deep, and no reason my two bottles of beer should consistently take over five minutes to go the ten feet from the cooler to the server station. I see you talking to the one guy at the bar, totally cool, make conversation with your customers, but the last time I checked your mouth and your hands use different muscles and with a bar that’s less that twenty feet long there’s no reason you can’t converse, look at tickets, and pour beers. And my god don’t even get me started on her pours. I get sometimes it’s a little foamier and it’s difficult to get it to pour right. But that means you take a little extra time to make it a proper pour. Don’t just hand me beer after beer after beer that’s at least 3 fingers of head. I’ve had tables joke with me about it “Hey where’s the rest of my beer lol jk” and I’ve always been like “no, you’re right, thank you. I can’t say shit but if you do I abso-fuckin-lutely will go get you those last 3 oz.” Why can’t I say shit? Why can’t I comfortably take her to task as I would with any other coworker who demonstrated that gigantic an ability gap at their job? Why, because she also happens to be the daughter of the couple that run it. Who’s pregnant by the way. Not really relevant because it’s been a problem long before her pregnancy but she’s also due within a month or so and probably shouldn’t be working 6+ hour bar shifts but she still is because we’re also constantly understaffed, and the most of the new staff we bring in don’t last more than a month because the whole FOH is terribly mismanaged half the time, and the ones who stay barely get trained before they’re thrown into it.

So I started working at a pub about 6 months ago and I work there regularly as either a waitress or a bartender, depending on what’s needed on the day.

One particular day we had a function (idk how it works in other places/countries but where I live/work people can rent out a function room with a bar and DJ for the night), and it was a 50th so I was happy since an older crowd usually means better tips. I was going to be a bartender tonight, not a waitress btw.

Anyway, the night starts off okay, we’re definitely over-staffed but I knew from experience that those extra people would be needed when it was time to call last orders.

At some point during the night it’s pretty much just two of us at the bar (I had very useless coworkers) and we have about 5 or 6 people waiting to get served. I’m moving as fast as I can and getting everyone their drinks, when I catch the eye of a woman who looks angry and throws her hands up when I walk past her.

Now normally I’m very nice when approaching customers, but tonight I was already pissed off because of my aforementioned useless coworkers. Seeing a grown woman throw a hissy fit because I didn’t serve her in the fifteen seconds it takes me to get someone a vodka coke pissed me off even more.

I eventually go up to her (mistake, I know) with an admittedly pissy look on my face. She proceeds to order two shots of Baby Guinness, which if you know what they are, can be messy to make.

I take over the shot glasses, pour the first half of the shot, and as I’m pouring the second, I accidentally spill some out. Now, keep in mind, this isn’t a fancy, upscale bar. It’s a casual, homely pub run by three siblings. If I was a super professional bartender, in an upscale facility I would understand her next actions a little bit more, but even so not really.

This grown ass woman, proceeds to POINT to where I spilled the liquor slightly, and began huffing and puffing like the fucking wolf from the story with the three little pigs. She basically HAD A TEMPER TANTRUM at the bar because I spilled some liquor.

Keep in mind that this did not affect how much was in the shot, and that she was still getting a full shot.

Then, my manager proceeds to let me go on my break (she gives us weird break times sometimes but I really needed one so I took it) and as I was walking outside to smoke a cigarette, guess who’s right in front of me? The hissy fit lady from earlier.

This woman proceeds to attempt to open the door, but pushes instead of pulls and hurts her finger. For some reason she looks at me like she expects me to dote on how hurt she is, but I just open the door and walk outside. Normally, I would make sure the customer is okay but this lady was extremely disrespectful, so I didn’t care at all that she got hurt.

She goes outside and begins yelling at me about my “sour face” and “bad attitude” and how I’m not “customer service”. No, not “customer service friendly”, but just not “customer service”.

I ignore her completely because I’m tired and just trying to get through the night but for the length of my thirty minute break I can hear her complaining about me from the other end of the smoking area.

I go back inside when my break is finished, and tell my manager what happened. My manager knows that I’m a good employee and she backs her staff so she just laughed about it with me. I resolve not to serve the woman for the rest of the night and things finish off fine.

I just have to say that I am always nice to my customers, but if you rudely get my attention and proceed to act like a child at the BAR, I literally could not care less about you as a customer anymore.

TLDR; Bartending at a private function when a grown ass woman begins throwing a hissy fit after having to wait 15 seconds to be served. Proceeds to throw another hissy fit when I accidentally spill some liquor, and later yells at/complains about me outside for 30 minutes that I have a “sour face” and am not “customer service” because I didn’t care when she mildly hurt her finger.",0,Apparently I’m not “customer service” - whatever that means?,22

This table had closed out, and the ladies were still finishing their cocktails. The busser went to pre bus the table, and they asked him for 2 pieces of pie to go. He went to the server, who was in the office getting band pay from the sage at the time. He told her what they wanted, and she told him she would grab them in a few seconds after she got done with the safe. He said he would get the pie for her and quickly walked out.

Now the 2 pieces of pie was combined 10.75, and they gave home a 20 and told him to keep the change. Keep in mind this busser tries to hustle everybody constantly. This guy walks up to the server and tells her that they told him to keep the change, so it's his change. She said ""no I don't think that's how it works"", his reply was ""oh that's how it works""

He then brought the 20 to me wanting me to ring it up and give him the change. I refused, and me and the head chef who is also the gm told him to talk to the server about it. He's making a huge deal about this. She finally relented and let him have it, but he was still demanding a tip out from her on top of that, which would've been about 9 dollars.

My point is that he's not a server, and it wasn't his job to take payment or get the food in the first place. If he would approached it better then maybe they could've split it, which the server said she would've been cool with had he approached it in a light way.

OL- NO, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED WHAT KIND OF CHEESE I WANT EVER, JUST PUT CHEESE ON IT.
Shazam- (kind of amused) You got it, I am going to put cheddar on it for you.
OL- Whatever

So I go and get the order in and then when the food comes out I had to go to the table because there was a problem with one of the steaks. I had the cooks remake the steak so I went back to the table to tell them it would be a couple minutes til it came back out.

Shazam- Just want to let you know that the steak will be a couple of minutes to be remade. (The customer is fine with this)
OL- I have a problem
Shazam- What seems to be the issue ma'am
OL- I need dressing for my burger
Shazam- Sure thing, what kind of dressing would you like? There is Ketchup already on the table, or I can bring you Mustard or Mayo. If you want dressing I have Ranch, Blue Cheese, 1000 island, BBQ or Hot Sauce. Which would you prefer?
OL- I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN ASKED SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT I WANT!!!  YOU KNOW WHAT NEVERMIND, I WILL EAT IT AS IS.
Shazam- You got it!

The table was fine after that and after they left we all had a good laugh about her.

So...I’d like to say if anyone here has seen my previous post, you already know that I love my job. I love the owners, the kitchen, my FOH coworkers and usually the customers. But being out of the way, new in town and one of a few Indian restaurants, we’re quite short staffed, particularly during the week. So last week in the UK was Easter holidays and being a broke 19yo I decided to pretty much work every shift (and made a mint). But on the Thursday night it was only myself and my boss FOH as the delivery driver called out unexpectedly due to car trouble. But as we only had a couple of bookings and it had been quiet all week we weren’t too worried and figured if we got too busy my boss could run out and do them or worst comes to worst stop doing deliveries for the night. And 28 people walked in the space of 15mins (we seat a max of 36 and the restaurant is on a different floor than the bar so it’s a lot of time and stairs to be able to make drinks for a table). As well as the phone ringing constantly. 

So, fast forward an hour and a half and we’re so deep in the weeds we may as well be 6ft under. So we start calling people back letting them know we will be unable to deliver their food and that well give them a 20% discount on their order if they can collect it, or we can refund it if they can’t. Most people are a bit annoyed but understanding but there is one woman in particular who I called about 7 times over the course of an hour. She wasn’t picking up the phone and she’s paid so we eventually managed to find a free 20 minutes for my boss to try and deliver her food to her. 

So he gets back and I assume all is well. God was I wrong. So I get a phone call from this woman and I assume that something was missing from her food order and pick up with my usual cheery greeting despite having a queue of around 5 people at the bar counter waiting to be served.

So she sounds quite angry and demands to know where her food is. So I assume maybe my boss didn’t attempt delivery and start to explain that our delivery driver had a bit of an incident regarding his car and we were trying to get in contact with our other drivers who worked different days (which we were) to replace him, however at the current point we were unable to deliver. Of course she went off a bit saying that we should have informed her, how she’s hungry and wants her food, how this is ridiculous, etc. I then add that if she would be willing to collect we can offer her a discount or we can refund her card with our apologies. And again angry words about wanting a refund, never ordering from us again and then saying that she can’t believe no one attempted to call her. So of course I politely informed her that I’ve been attempting to contact her on the number she’s originally called from (which was the same one she was calling from now but I didn’t tell her that). She straight up starts shouting at me that I’m lying, she had her phone on her all night and we’re just trying to steal from her. Then my boss comes up to me and asks if I’m speaking to the same woman as earlier.  So I say something along the lines of “bare with me one moment m’am, my boss is just updating me about your order”. 

My boss is very angry and tells me he tried to deliver her food but no one was answering the door and she wasn’t answering her phone. Of course after a while knowing I was alone with the phone, the drinks, the customers, running food etc, he had to give up and come back. 

So of course I pick the phone back up and ask her if we could check her address with her quickly as my boss found some time to attempt and deliver but WE THINK HE HAD THE WRONG HOUSE AS NO ONE WAS ANSWERING. She lost it at me. She started screaming down the phone that we were lying, that we were awful people, that I was awful and that this was all my fault, she’d be putting an awful review online, she’d never order from us again, that I did this on purpose, that she couldn’t believe a paying customer would be treated that way, that I was thinking she was stupid and she’s a very intelligent woman, all the nice things. 

Midway through this I started crying and towards the end of the phone call I was sobbing and trying to tell her that it’s not my fault, that I’m just telling her what I’m told and that my boss will call her back to sort out her refund. She says she doesn’t want to be bothered by him or me ever again and to give her back her money immediately. And hangs up. 

So with a queue of customers waiting, I have to excuse myself to go and sob in the office and try and calm down. And then start serving customers again. My boss comes down after about 20 minutes, sees that I’ve been crying, takes the phone and calls this woman back. He went off at her saying never to talk to his staff that way again, that we don’t need or want customers like her and basically just a polite f you. 

Thinking back on it now, this “very intelligent woman” should think twice about upsetting someone who has her mobile phone number, full name, card details and home address. 
I also hope that making a 19yo girl stressed out of her mind cry made her feel better and I hope that one day she’s treated the same way. 

On the bright side, I got to take her food home with me...about £35 of curry, side dishes and popadoms!!",0,Awful lady makes me cry on the phone whilst in the weeds,48
367,Its_Clover_Honey,0,t3_bh2ask,10,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bh2ask/how_should_i_approach_quitting_my_job/,"Warning: long post. This is just the tip of the iceberg, keep that in mind. Tl;dr I was promoted to management ~6 months ago and I've been mistreated and felt disrespected since. Its causing me a lot of anxiety and making my health worse. Should I work my next shift and let them know its my last or should I give them 2 weeks notice?

I work at a restaurant chain. I started as one of the original staff when we opened almost 2 years ago and I worked my ass off the whole year, working weeks without a day off, working 4 or 5 12 hour serving shifts in a row, working 60 hour weeks, etc. I used to love my job. I was promoted to management ~6 months ago and I've been mistreated since.

 The 2 girls who were managing before me (one quit, one stepped down) both started at $14 an hour despite having no managerial experience. I started at $12 and got a $1 raise when the other girl stepped down. When they both quit/stepped down they were making $15/hour. I now do 80% of the managerial work that has to do with the computer. I do scheduling, handling the invoices (which I've been doing since before I was promoted. Wasnt getting paid extra to do them then either) handling hiring emails, handling any LTO print outs, etc. The only things I dont do computer wise are ordering (for now, there are plans to have me take that over as well) and catering/donation emails.

Since I took over scheduling completely about a month ago there have been issues. When I do the schedules my GM will go in and change about half of what I had down and wont tell me what he changed or why. Hes also blaming me when people come to him asking about not getting their normal shifts or having their hours cut which probably 85% of the time isn't my fault. I've only cut 2 peoples hours because of poor performance. He has also fired 2 employees without notifying me so when both of those people messaged me asking why they're no longer on the schedule I had no answers for them. 
Communication has been an issue in general. We recieved new menus with price changes a few weeks ago and I wasnt told about it until the day before they were delivered. Most of the time I'm not informed of changes or decisions until they happen or I ask about them. 

I am also the only one who gets yelled at when things aren't done properly. The other manager is basically free to do whatever the fuck he wants without any repercussions. I have an autoimmune disease and I have been having a very bad flare for the last 2 or so weeks (doc said probably triggered by stress go figure) and last saturday I asked if we could close half an hour early because of low  sales volume and because I was in a lot of pain and very tired. Hes known about my health issues since I started here, it comes up in conversation quite a bit as well because his wife also suffers from an autoimmune condition. I also mentioned I felt bad for my closing server because she worked early the next morning and it really didnt seem worth it for her to stay. He said no, made a joke about it, and I thought that was that. We were closed sunday for easter.

Monday rolls around and I get a mile long text message about TWO SMALL THINGS that had not been done properly. Saying that if the serving staff doesnt want to do their jobs theyre replaceable etc etc he never wants to be asked to close early ever again he doesnt give a shit what the reason is (i had only ever asked once before because I was experiencing bad chest pain probably also from stress) and a bunch of other hostile stuff toward the staff and ended it with ""if you dont like it please keep it to yourself I don't care"". Wow okay. Then an hour later I get a text from my closing server from saturday night asking why her hours had been cut. She is the aforementioned former manager who stepped down. She has also worked her ass off for this restaurant since we opened, even through her fathers sickness and eventual passing. I had scheduled her for her normal 3 days, all closing shifts. Her schedule had gone down to 2 days, neither of which were closing. I messaged my manager about it and he claimed he had ""just posted what was scheduled"". He then proceeded to ignore any messages from her for three days.

There is also the issue of not having another manager. He has been saying he'll hire a new manager and has continued to push the dates back for months. I was supposed to be out of the country for 2 weeks this month. I ended up pushing the dates back and I let the other manager know as well as changing my availability in our scheduling app. Other manager forgot to tell our GM (so did I tbh). GM did not ask about my trip or say anything about hiring a new manager until 2 weeks before I was originally supposed to leave. Its just us 3, had I actually been gone for 2 weeks they would have been fucked. Its absolutely impossible for to get more than 2 days off in a row now because theres only 3 of us and my GM is never here. This makes it very hard for me to schedule doctors appointments as I have to travel for them. 

I have had countless joint injuries because of this job and I've had a breathing problem for a year because of the stress this job causes me. My general health has taken a nose dive and its becoming increasingly expensive. Please help me.",0,How should I approach quitting my job?,3
368,jacksonor,0,t3_bgpq5v,3,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bgpq5v/the_torn_bag_robbery/,"Before I get into this one, I should mention it's not wholly my story. I was on shift while it happened, but it was not my table that will go down in infamy as the most incompetent thieves/scammers that my former workplace ever saw.

So, this happened just over a year ago. While I have since moved on, at this point I was working at a medium-large seafood/meat chain. Not fine dining, but dinner for two would set you back about $150 with wine; the kind of place where a tie would be too dressy but a collared shirt is the norm.

While we had a pretty expansive dining room, we were usually pretty quiet on weeknights and it was standard practice to only have two servers on. On this fine eve, it was myself and another gentleman. I will be referring to this gentleman as B.

So, it's been a slow night and its B's turn in the seating order when a couple that just screams ""trouble"" walks in. She could have passed for our usual clientele, but the gentleman on her arm looked like Post Malone after a real bad meth jag. While I know I shouldn't be so quick to judge, they also threw up the reddest of flags: trying to order booze from the host before the server had even been to the table.

Sure enough, when B arrives the first thing they do is order a double shot each. B - being short on other tables to occupy his attention - is prompt with delivering the drinks. After the perfunctory ""few minutes with the menu"", he goes by to see if they are ready to order.

&amp;#x200B;

B - ""So, have we decided?""

Girl - ""Sure. But you forgot to bring us our drinks.""

&amp;#x200B;

Sure enough, there are no glasses on the table. However, B's sharp eyes catch a glint in the space between the booth and the wall. Our enterprising grifters have both stashed their glasses next to them, out of obvious sight in the hopes they could get away with a free round (I presume). B points out that he can see their glasses and they both get flustered. The gentleman steps in to tell him they need a bit more time, but they will take another drink.

At this point, B walks away from the table and alerts our manager. Now, all three of us (me, B, our manager) have been in this game a long time, and we are all really bored on such a slow night - so we decide to see how this plays out. B brings them their second round and they order appetizers.

On his next sojourn into the dining room, these two wave him over to tell him that there ""is no way these are doubles, we need a fresh round"". B calmly states that he saw the bartender pour them and there will be no new round. They give him the side-eye, but stop complaining about the drinks. They switch to complaining about the food as soon as it starts hitting the table.

I am sure the attempted scam here is obvious to everyone: they are fishing for something free. Complain about everything until something sticks. Luckily, the manager on duty is a salty old dog and she is having none of their bullshit. She concedes nothing. They get their food remade with smiles from all of us, but nothing comes off their bill.

Of course, the three of us are tagging off shifts watching them. Failed scammers can turn into runners at the drop of a hat. With this, we enter the end game. They ask for the bill and take out containers to pack up their food. B goes to the back and it's my turn to watch them. Nothing happens. They pay (no tip) and start to pack up their food. Kinda anti-climactic. But now we have let our guard down.

A quick note: their table at the end of the meal was utter chaos. They had slow-rolled their appetizer so that it was only half-eaten when dinner arrived. We are also a restaurant that brings complimentary bread so there is a half-full bread basket on the table along with the glasses from their two rounds of drinks and waters (they waved B off when he tried to clear their glasses).

I walk by them packing up what's left of their appetizer and entrees and don't see anything out of the ordinary. I greet a new table and go to punch in their drinks. I am at the server terminal when I hear the distinct sound of running footsteps and the sound of tearing paper. I look up in time to see our failed criminals legging it out the door.

Behind them is strewn a trail of detritus: the bread basket from the table, three of their hi-ball glasses, their cutlery, every cloth napkin that they could get their hands on, and - of course - their leftovers. They had tried to stuff all of it into the - admittedly large - take-out bag. My guess is that one of the legs of the metal bread basket had torn the whole thing totally open as they made their break for the exit.

Their response to being unable to get their food for free was to try and stock their kitchen with our restaurant supplies. Unfortunately for them, all they left with was a reputation for being too dumb to understand the shortcomings of paper bags.

TL;DR - A pair of would-be scam artists fail to get anything for free and respond by trying to steal anything they can get their hands on; they fail at that too.

369,praedari,0,t3_bgcghb,152,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bgcghb/you_know_that_was_a_servers_tip_right/,"So a few days ago, I encountered the worst kind of customer - the kind that sits at a dirty table and steals the cash tip left over from the previous table.

It's in the middle of dinner shift for our busiest day of the week, where we pretty much just turn and burn all night long. My buddy, we'll call him Steve, closes out a table, who leaves him a cash tip on the table. A new 2 top is ushered towards the dirty table, where they are told to hold on for just a second while we finish bussing it. Of course, they don't listen, and sit down. 

Before they were directed over to the table, I'm made aware that it's gonna be mine, so I do what I can to bus it and get it ready since I have hands. At this point, I've seen Steve's tip on the table before we finished bussing it, and know that it was on the table at one point.

The table sits, and I greet them, at which point I see cash on the table again. Not sure if it's Steve's tip or their money, since I didn't complete bussing the table, I don't say anything. 

I get them drinks, take their order, put it in, done. The cash has gone off the table at some point during this time.

Steve comes up and asks me, ""Hey man, did you see a cash tip on table X? 'Gina' said there was a tip when she finished bussing it.""

I tell him yes, I saw money on the table, but I'm not sure if it was his tip. I offer to go ask the table if they saw cash on the table. So I do, and I'm very clear to ask them if it was ON the table when they sat down. No response. I ask again, and the girl shares a look with the guy, before she answers yes, there was money on the table. The guy looks at me, realizes that I'm not going anywhere until he gives me the money, and reluctantly  pulls out a five. He pauses, seems to think, and then pulls out another dollar bill, before finally saying, ""yeah, there was six dollars."" 

It takes me a second to realize that this dude isn't moving slowly because he's stoned or something, but that he was hoping I would walk away and let him steal the fucking tip. 

I just tell him, ""You know that was a server's tip, right?"" before giving Steve his tip and telling one of the MODs about it. Everyone is appalled, and, thank the restaurant gods, management decides to cancel their food order and throw them out.

The guy tries to get into the face of the manager who handled the situation and talks a lot of shit and claims he found it on the ground, culminating in him demanding we cancel their order. Which, of course, the manager laughs at, telling him we already have, and to get the fuck out. 

EDIT: To answer the very valid question of why we didn't take the cash tip off the table - most of our servers prefer to pick up cash off the table themselves here. CC tips no one cares who grabs it, but cash tips the servers will generally get themselves. Strange, I know, but that's how it is here. 

TL;DR asshole steals a server's tip, denies it to management when confronted, and is told to get the fuck out.

370,Maitladk,0,t3_bgj8ak,50,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bgj8ak/common_country_club_occurrences/,"in honour of getting a new job at a Brewery down the road, I figured I would share my horror stories from the country club I worked at. I have a ton of stories from the period of time I worked at this country club as a server / Bartender but this one takes the cake imo. To give some context there is such big money here that there are literally Hundreds of Yachts parked outside on docks. About 85% of it is ""old money"" so a lot of people are pretty entitled there.    

So I was restocking the bar at lunch nothing too crazy or too busy, it was the springtime so not too much was going on. I noticed my girlfriend's table ( she used to be a server there as well) needed some water and she had a pretty busy section for lunch so I went over to the table and refilled their water with the pitcher and said something to the effect of ""I figured you guys could use a refill"". Initially, they said nothing, which was characteristic of our clientele when you would try and speak to them. At this point, I was used to it so I just filled up their waters but as I went to walk away one of them grabbed me. With his hand on my upper arm, he pulled me down to table level and said: "" just so you know when you address my family its sir and ma'am, not you guys"".  It was honestly such a shock that I just apologized and went back behind the bar.   

later in the shift, I was talking to my Girlfriend and she said that that table would routinely come in and be super rude and picky. Even at one point Only referring to her as ""the help"" throughout a meal they invited their friends and family too.

One of those “farm to table” knockoff abominations that was springing up everywhere but never worked, because it’s still corporate and everyone expects to get the same kind of food at every location. Have tons of stories from that place, from the trashed lady being refused service and trying to fake a slip and fall after being told to leave, to the classic a-hole trying to skip an hour wait and seat himself because “I’m a **** member and I DON’T WAIT!”  

Anyway, was working with this real jag of a server for a long time, we’d both been there since the place opened, and he was one of those typical downtown primadonna types that thinks they’re god’s gift to restaurants. Like, full-on “I should get all the big parties and don’t you dare seat CHILDREN in MY section” types. Let’s just call him “K”. 

Well I had started out at the restaurant as a host, I still had a big part in training the new hostesses/hosts, and so I naturally had a soft spot for them. And this d*** made one of the newer ones cry for following the damn rotation. Oh hell no. Nice girl, customers liked her, she was doing a solid job, didn’t let the servers push her around, DID NOT DESERVE IT. I hear about it the next day from another hostess, because it was bad enough that it had made it all the way around the FOH by then. 

And then the universe throws me a bone. We take a call that day for a big group, like 17. They’re nice enough to tell us in advance that 9 of those are children. I casually tell the hostess to take that little bit out of the notes, and just type “seat with K”. She knew what was going down right away, judging by the smirk as she changed it. 

So this jag comes in, sees the books, and goes to work making his tables oh so perfect, since it’s a slow night anyway, and he’s sticking around just for the one big party, while the few other servers on actually have an ok night since he’s occupied. Then in walks his group. To be honest, these were some of the best behaved children we’d had in there, perfect manners, no picky eaters, good kids. But he was still livid, and when he tried to give the hostess a death glare I was right up there next to her meeting his eyes and shaking my head. 

Turned out to be campers, they stuck around forever and very few of the adults were even drinking, so it was a pretty low check for a group that size.

I work at a small, casual dine-in/takeout restaurant where most of our business comes from to go orders. Due to the inexpensive nature of our food and our lack of bigger bills, we do not accept $100 bills for small quantities of food. Usually it’s not a big deal to customers but let me just say, this one is a doozy.

On this particular Saturday, a poorly groomed woman strolls into the store. We greet her and ask her if she’s placed an order, which she has, and would like to pay with a $100 bill. Our front counter rep politely explains that we will be unable to make change for that big of a bill and offers her the option of paying with a card or a smaller bill. She looks puzzled and walks back out to her car, presumably to look for smaller bills, but instead she tells her husband, who is furious.

The husband flings open the door, waving the $100 in the air and immediately starts screaming at our front counter rep (a 15 year old boy, one of the boss’s relatives) 

“This is cash fucking money! I want my fucking food right now! What, you don’t take American money here?! What kind of business is this?”

Our manager hears the ruckus and comes up to the front to deal with the situation, where he politely explains the same policy that our front counter rep had explained prior. 

“This is bullshit, you ain’t hard, n***a! You ain’t hard!” 

Mind you, this guy was as white as they come, and looked like he had just crawled out of the depths of trailer park hell.

Eventually my manager refuses his order and tells him to leave the store. He refuses, and the police were called. Once my manager flipped his phone around to show the guy that he was calling the cops, he grunted and hobbled back out to his car.

Fast forward about an hour later and the guy calls the store back. One of our young female team members answers the phone, and the guy immediately says “suck my dick, bitch!” And hangs up.

He calls back AGAIN and this time my manager answers. He’s not the kind of guy to take kindly to sexual harassment of a minor, so him and this guy are just going back and forth on the phone for 5 minutes, throwing every conceivable insult at each other, and by the end of it my manager was furious, he let the guy know that the police were notified and that this location would not be serving him anymore.

So this guy puts in a case with our corporate manager and claims that we called him the N word, and called us racists. Very ironic considering he was the only one dropping N bombs in the store that day.

Here’s where it gets weird. My manager was closing up the store the following night. He gets off work and runs over to the gas station across the street to get some snacks, and runs into two police officers, one of which he went to high school with. He’s catching up with his buddy and the other cop recognizes him.

Cop: “Hey aren’t you the guy I spoke with on the phone the other day about the crazy customer?”

Manager: “Yeah! Whatever happened with that?”

Cop: “Well let’s just say you won’t have to worry about him anymore.”

Manager: “Did you guys arrest him or something?”

Cop: “Not exactly...”

Turns out that this guy went home that night after the incident and took his own life.

I’m pretty shocked, as I decided to creep through his Facebook and he seemed like a pretty well-put together guy. He didn’t look at all like the  trailer trash we saw walk through our door in any of his pictures, and apparently he was even a head chef on a cruise liner. I don’t really know how to feel about this one, and my manager is pretty shaken up. Probably the craziest story to come out of my job so far. Prayers go out to his wife and family, this dude obviously had a lot of problems that we don’t know about.

TL;DR: A white customer was mad that we couldn’t break $100 on a $10 order, proceeds to call our staff the N word, calls back and tells a young female team member to suck his dick, puts in a case with corporate and claims WE called HIM the N word, we find out later that after the incident, he went home and took his own life.",0,Abusive customer does the unthinkable,137

     I know a lot of guest are not as inclined to tip us, as they would a server. And you're right, you don't have to, no one is forcing you, but it's a nice gesture. It is always very appreciated. 
     But why do I deserve anything at all? Well, let's break it down. We assist hosting (seating, placing reservations, and directing all incoming phone calls), we assist food running, sometimes we even assist bussing. And ofcourse , we do takeout (answering incoming calls , placing their orders, placing tablet orders (Doordash/Grubhub/Postmates and occasionally catering Office Express orders). We pack our own food to go, we go through many or the same hurdles a server does to insure your food is correct and properly made, whether is be the presentation the temperature or the sometimes ridiculous modifications.  And you know what, I feel like takeout is monitored more closely. Servers have the luxury or offering solutions or getting plates fixed ASAP , say if the runner misses something. Takeout does not, we get a phone call asking to speak to a manager, or they file a corporate complaint. 
     Oh, and another thing. Servers do not tip out takeout, so please don't assume just because you tipped your serve last time 20% on a large check, that it trickled down to takeout. Even if we helped run your food.

i’ve posted about coworker A before. this is yet another one of her moments. down the grapevine, my friend texts me in a panic. i know she’s on shift, so i assume some weird shit went down, and i ask what’s wrong. 

nothing could prepare me for the disgust i felt wash over my entire body. 

i called coworker A cindy before, but now it involves coworker B (i guess i’ll call him noah?)

cindy calls noah over and proceeds to show him $200 worth of sex toys she purchased recently on her phone. he’s trapped with her on shift, so there’s no escape when she tells him the following:

“if i were younger, you’d be all over me”

my friend maple asks if cindy was flirting, and noah, dejected and disgusted, says yes. noah is such a nice guy, and i really do like having shifts with him, but he didn’t say anything to cindy. he stayed dead silent for his entire shift as she continued. 

for three hours.

perhaps the part that made me literally GAG was when cindy informed noah that she masturbates too much. out of morbid curiosity, noah asks how often.

8 times in the morning. 8 times at night.

my response to maple was simple: cindy’s bits must look like a goddamn raisin at that point

Today Doordash called and asked to make an order. When we got to a certain point in the order, Doordash told me to pause the order so he can confirm something. He then said that he would call me back so I saved his order. But he never called back, so I went and continued my work. Then a Doordash worker came in to pick up the order, but the order wasn’t complete, so we didn’t have an order for him.

When the delivery guy called Doordash, Doordash said that they cancelled the order. I thought he didn’t want the food anymore.

Then the customer called and started yelling at me, and when I explained to him, he still yelled at me. I think he was too angry to understand logic. He then ends in, “I know the manager really well Oohh you don’t even know how much trouble you are in. He is going to be so angry at you.” I asked for his phone number so my manager can call him (he wasn’t here today). Damn.

I was so angry I teared up so I went to the bathroom to calm myself down. During that time, the @sshole called again, my coworker picked it up (she was with me the whole time when everything occurred). 

HE WANTED TO KNOW MY NAME

My coworker just won’t give it to him. She kept dodging his demand and told him that she’ll tell the manager. By the fourth time he called, we didn’t even pick up, we were fed up. 

I bet he called Doordash first but didn’t get the answer he wanted so he came after us.

I texted my manager about it and he said don’t worry about it.

It’s a small place, just me and one cook working at the time, and I know most of customers and their orders fairly well. I had maybe seen this couple once or twice, but I had no recollection of any special orders or really anything about them that stood out. 

They’re friendly, take a seat, look at their menus. I come to take their order and they want a veggie flatbread (popular, normal order, that’s fine) but then they ask for a flatbread with just sausage and cheese. A lot of people assume we’ll have general pizza ingredients, because the flatbreads resemble a long rectangular ultra thin crust pizza. But we don’t, no marinara, no pepperoni, no sausage. We do serve breakfast and we have breakfast sausage patties, so I ask if they’d like me to cut up sausage patties for them, and what kind of cheese they like. 

Wife: no that’s not the kind we get, it’s normal sausage. We get it all the time. 

Me: I’m sorry ma’am but I don’t have that kind of sausage, would you like pork belly instead? 

Wife: No I don’t even know what that is. The cooks have made it for me before. 

Me: I’m sorry but I don’t know how it was made for you. Do you remember the ingredients? 

Wife: No it was just sausage and cheese! 

Me: It might have been a special, sometimes we get different ingredients in for the week’s special. 

Wife: No it wasn’t on the menu! (Our specials are never on the menu, they’re on a chalkboard easily visibly in the tiny restaurant) Let me just look at the menu again. 

I hand them another menu and explain the situation to the cook. He also has no clue what they mean, and the two of us work about half the time we’re open, so if neither of us know you’re not ordering it often at all. They ended up leaving angrily just a couple minutes later, still mad I didn’t automatically know how to put together this flatbread with an ingredient we don’t have. 

It occurred to me about an hour later that our stuffed mushrooms are stuffed with a cream cheese, Gouda, and pizza sausage mixture. We only make enough to stuff the mushrooms, and there’s almost never any left over. But I’m guessing on a day there was extra a specific cook, who likes to offer alterations to customers in the most inconsistent way possible, decided to make these people a flatbread with an ingredient almost never available, and not even tell them how to order it properly.

First of all, yesterday, I found myself tongue twisted a lot. You know when you mean to say “Have a great night” or “take care” but you end up saying “Have a take care!”
I’m not really sure why it kept happening but sometimes I just have those days. My point in explaining that is because when I went to go greet an older couple (60’s?), I accidentally said, “How are you people doing today!”  I never say that but I meant to say “you both” or “folks” but it came out as “people” lol a little embarrassing but whatever. So the guy says “ah she said people! She’s smart. People always say “you guys” but my wife isn’t a guy!” 
So he goes on this long rant about servers referring to his wife as a guy. I’m like, okay I get it. But at the same time, when he walked in, he mentioned she needed a wide table because of her size, pointing to her and laughing. She looked at me and rolled her eyes. She wasn’t having any of it. Anyway, when I went to take their order, I did it. I accidentally said, “are you guys ready to order?” And he made a huuuuge deal of it. Mocking me, saying I was stupid and how I’m just like everyone else. He was trying to joke with me but it was really insulting! He actually said, “oh my god! You’re so stupid!” 
So he said he was ready to order and asked me if I was ready to take his order. I said yes and he just stared at me. Like literally just stared. Then he said, “aren’t you going to write it down?”  I motioned to my head, “its all up here!” He shifted in his seat and said, “so, here’s the deal. If a waitress doesn’t write down my order and then mess it up, I don’t tip and I write a bad review. Do you understand?” 
I just smiled at him and said, “ oooo I love a challenge! Challenge accepted!” And went to put his order in. Their food came out, perfectly, and he didn’t say anything else to me except “good” when I quality checked them. He left me 20% as well. But WHY did he have to be so rude? Why can’t he just go out to eat and be civil?
Also, I like to add that it can be frustrating when you go out to eat and a server doesn’t write down the order and then forget a mod or a side dish. I normally do write down orders but all they ordered were salads with extra dressing.

Yesterday I had a couple come in that actually did that. The story of what happened before and after is still baffling me. It's Monday night, nothing unusual happening, just tending to 4-5 tables solo when the couple comes in. I greet and direct them to their table, but they see a patio area in the back and request to sit there, which I oblige to.

Nothing unusual from them so far, I give them menus and water and come back in a few minutes to see what's up. The guy just asks a few questions about what suggestions I have and whatnot. I take their order and bring out their appetizers/alcohol when it's ready. Honestly they seemed like normal people, but unbeknownst to me SHIT was about to go DOWN as I was bringing their entree. I set the food down, ask if everything is alright, and they tell me they only had a little bit of their appetizer and they would like to get a refund on the item. I tell them I'll take it to the kitchen and see what I can do. Obviously unless there was something inherently wrong with the food I can't just take it off their tab(we sometimes do some discounts on just that item, but this wasn't one of them.) That's what I end up telling them and I say it's what my manager told me to say. However, the guy is adamant that he wants to speak to the manager. So I trudge back to the kitchen to tell the owner/manager that the table wants to speak to her. Now, that's just one of the few things that made these people downright the most entitled, petty, and rude customers I've ever had. 

After I come back inside I run some food and tend to some tables when I straight up hear loud ass yelling from the customers to my manager how this is the worst customer service they had and how rude we waiter/manager were. Some of the tables inside were even turning around to look at wtf is going on. At this point it's like whatever, I just went them to pay for their shit and leave. Some time passes by and the couple come inside wanting to pay their tab. I bring the check to them and the guy looks down to see that we hadn't removed the item from their bill. Then he tells me if we're gonna make them pay for the food they said they didn't like they wanted it boxed up, so I box it up and give it to them. While they were handing some cash to put down I'm right next to them refilling some water bottles when I see the girlfriend take these plastic alcohol advertisements we have and drop it between the water fountain and the wall... Not to mention the guy was still berating me spouting the same stuff from before at the same time. At that moment my brain just shorted out and I was at a loss for words so I just walked away. And that was the end. Is what I would say if they didn't as they were walking out say for the last time that they didn't like the food they ordered and won't be paying for it(they didn't). What they didn't pay for the item they made up in SPIT. They fucking spat on the check, man. To top it all off, when I went to bus their shit from outside I find that they took the sizzle platter that had some of the food and sauce on it and turned it onto the metal grate table they sat at.

Well, last week I worked Fri-Sun. Friday, the manager wasn’t at work and everyone felt at peace for once. Saturday, she came back and made everyone miserable again. She also sent me home after 6 hours (I work 9 hour shifts). I was slightly upset but I couldn’t stay in that hellhole any longer. Sunday (Easter) she sent me home after five hours. I said to her “I need at least 8 hours”.  She still told me to go home. I was upset because I missed church to go to work, only to be sent home for no reason. I didn’t even clock out, I just grabbed my stuff and left. I have a feeling she’s been cutting my hours because there are a lot of new hires and a previous employee came back to work.

This man, we’ll call him T, walked in on a slow weekday to the bar and sat down. Before I could approach him I proceeded to watch him take a salt shaker and dump a good amount into his hand. He then licked the salt off of his hand and repeated a couple times. I looked at my coworker with a “help me” look and she reminded me that it was my turn in rotation.
I approach T, introduced myself, and asked him what I can get him to drink. T then has the audacity to grab my hand with the hand that he had JUST licked multiple times and shake it, introducing himself as well. I gulp down words or disgust and take his drink order, then run to the kitchen as fast as I can to scrub my arms with four rounds of soap and try not to gag.
T drinks his whiskey sprites (3 of them) and at the end of his stay asks when he can come back to see me. I avoid telling him when I’m working next though he persistently attempts to find out.

Fast forward a couple weeks, T comes in yet again. He’s holding a camera. It was a slow week day during the lull between lunch and dinner so I was the only server in the restaurant at the moment. I gave him his whiskey sprite and walk away to our POS system to ring it in, when I turn around he’s standing directly behind me, not even half a foot from my face. He asks to show me pictures and proceeds to turn on his camera and flip through pictures of random scenery, people, and places. I’m practically cornered with no ability to move from the space by the POS and I was only saved a few minutes later when a server walked in for her shift and he scampered off as soon as she came through the door.

You would hope he was gone, but no. A week later he showed up again. This time I was not working, and two servers had to tell me the story. He walked in with a rag held to his head, and the rag covered in blood. He persistently asked to see me, and insisted on knowing when I worked next. He tried to sit down to have a drink and the manager kicked him out because of the wound on his head, and told him not to come back. This sounded like the end of things.

For a month afterwards, he didn’t come back. However I could swear I saw him around. He would walk by outside the restaurant while I was serving tables on the patio. I saw him sitting on a bench across the street from the restaurant. I saw him walking away as I drove home from work. I assumed he was a local creep and just hung out around the area.

A month had passed and he hadn’t attempted to come back, until one day T walked into the restaurant as another server was working. He handed her an envelope and told her to give it to me, then he left. She opened the envelope and proceeded to pull out 20+ pictures of me. These pictures were taken outside the restaurant while I was working, leaving work, etc.

For most of the late 2000's til recently, I worked at a semi-dive-y, working class brew pub in a big, liberal West Coast city. 

I've seen a lot of weird, wild shit, literally and figuratively, but one of the most oddly sexist things happened many years back. I once had a man say that he did not want me, as a female, to pour his beer. 

This guy was white, middle aged, dressed casual but not scummy, pretty normal for our clientle. 

I had asked him what he wanted and he replied, ""Your hoppiest IPA, but I don't want a woman to pour it. I want HIM *gestures over to male coworker* to pour it. ""

Now, I've been pulling pints for many years at this point and had mastered the art of The Perfect Pour. 

I thought about telling him to leave, or just ignoring him until he left, but we were busy, and instead I just shrugged and walked over to my coworker and told him what the situation was.

We both agreed that he was gonna have to wait.

After we helped everyone else in line, about ten people, including several people who had walked up after him, my coworker walked over to the man.

He confirmed he still wanted our hoppiest IPA, (which is a common order of a douche).

When my coworker poured the pint, he let the beer fall straight into the glass, and a mighty head formed. 

He handed the beer back to the man, a 20 oz pint that was a good 10 oz of foam. I wish I could say I remember the look on the mans face, but I don't. I just imagine he was pissed. 

The best part is he had to have watched me pour at least five perfect pints while he had to wait.

I made a throwaway account because my restaurant is incredibly recognizable by the description. This all happened in 2011, but I’ll never forget the details, ‘cause its one of the weirdest things to ever happen to me in 21 years in the restaurant business. 

I work at a large, corporate restaurant which specializes in chicken wings, beer, and lots of televisions so you can watch whatever televised sporting event your heart desires. There was another establishment much like ours (except its servers were required to wear short shorts and tank tops), we’ll call it, “Wise Birbs,” within 10 miles from us that had just closed down, so we ended up getting a few of their regulars. 

Enter, “Woody:” a shy, scruffy man in his mid to late 50s. Very soft spoken, always carried a large backpack. Woody was nice enough, but always made attempts at conversation that were incredibly detailed, which was kind of a red flag to me. He would always ask me and the other female bartenders how many kids we had, what their names were, if we had any pets, *their* names, etc. Most of the other girls thought that he meant well, he was probably just socially awkward, but there were a few of us who were kind of creeped out by him.

One month later, Woody walked in and immediately picked me out and asked where my section was. I led him to one of my tables and came back a second later with his drink. He smiled and said, “Before you order my wings, I have a present for you. Something I made.” I could feel the color drain from my face as he unzipped his backpack and pulled out an expertly sanded and sealed piece of wood with my name (mis-spelled, the way it was spelled in our POS system) carved into it and a cute, cartoon puppy burned into the background. It was really well done, but I could tell that something like this had taken a *lot* of time to complete.

I thanked him and he went on to explain that he had made one for all of his, “regular girls,” at Wise Birbs. The rest of his visit there was pretty uncomfortable, but I didn’t let it show. I did however, let all of the other women at work know because I was pretty sure he was going to do the same for them. I was right. Over the next month or so, he showed up with different pieces of wood carved with each of the women’s names and their children’s names carved into the background. I only have dogs, hence the cartoon puppy. I think most of us were thrown off by the gesture because these carvings were pretty well done and he never blatantly hit on any one of us. We were all just taken aback, so we all just smiled and thanked him and thought nothing of it...

...until he came to work with a camera.

Eventually he came by, once again, picking me out and asking for my section. As he sat down, he whipped out the backpack, an even bigger smile on his face. Out of the backpack, he pulled and older digital camera and some flash bulb mechanism on a metal stick and sat it on the table in front of me. “Whatcha got there, ‘Woody?’” I asked. “Okay!” He replied. “Now that I have made gifts for all of you girls, I just need one small gift in return!” Oh fuck. Excuse me?

Then, he proceeded to pull out several small photo albums containing pictures of all of his, “regular girls” at Wise Birbs working (delivering food, keying in orders, standing at the host stand), captioned with things like, “Tiffany: great legs!” “Sarah: best butt!” “Lisa: nice smile!” He explained to me that he was, “collecting his girls,” so that he could look at us always. He was *collecting* us. Like Pokémon cards. Like baseball cards. Like some weird, passively sexual trophies of women who had served him wings. I was absolutely floored.

“So,” he said. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to take your picture!”

Me: What? No, Woody. I’m uncomfortable with all of that. I appreciate your gift and, if you’d like it back, I understand. But I absolutely will not let you take a picture of me, and I guarantee you, my co-workers won’t either.

W: (shocked, stuttering) “So- -so I really can’t take your picture?”

Me: No, Woody.

He sort of just hung his head and slumped his shoulders for a second and then raised his head to tell me that he was a little disappointed and would just like to get his regular order to go. I refused and sent him packing. A couple of weeks later, another regular informed me that Woody wouldn’t be coming by anymore because he felt he had worn out his welcome. Alright then, Woody.

395,BootyUnlimited,0,t3_bge6a9,12,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bge6a9/the_disastrous_cobb_salad/,"So just some quick background information for you all. I worked for two summers as a waiter at a ritzy country club on Long Island. For anyone here who knows anything about Long Island, you will know that there is quite a good mix of wealthy people are perhaps those who could be described as middle class. I am from a fairly well off family, but my parents have always been adamant about me working a ""real"" job to get a feel for what it is like. Honestly, I think everyone should have to work as a waiter, but I digress. Oh, and I was 18 or 19 at the time. And I'm a guy if that matters.

So the country club I worked at has two separate restaurants. There is a very fancy indoor restaurant with a dress code, nice silverware and dishes, all that fun stuff. And then there is the outdoor restaurant, which is a series of tables with umbrellas and a slight overhang with some more tables closer to the snack bar. And the whole outdoor restaurant is perched (fenced off) above the pool area. All of the staff (mostly high school and college kids) switch roles quite often, unless they really excel at one thing. Like any restaurant there are busboys, servers, snack bar staff, and kitchen runners. Nothing too out of the ordinary.

But enough backstory, I think you guys get the idea. So it was a warm sunny day in June, and I was rather enjoying working outside. On slow days I would bring my book to read, since there was no rule against doing so (not to mention that reading for fun blew some of the minds of the younger staff) but again this is not really important. As the clock approaches noon the lunch rush begins. Now there is a weekly swim class at the pool, which inevitably means a ton a sopping wet kids are about to order a mountain of chicken fingers and mac n' cheese. No problem, this isn't my first rodeo, and the kids like me because I am always kind (at least I try to be). After picking up 4 of the 8 tables myself (some of the other staff were often slow to get tables) I took orders and everything was going swimmingly (no pun intended). 

Then of course, in walks a very affluent looking Long Island mom with her huge sunglasses and equally huge purse. She sits with her wet kids (a young girl and boy) and calls me over to order. First of all, calling over a server after just sitting down is not standard procedure, but I ignored it and went over with a smile to take their order. The kids order no problem, a burger and chicken fingers. Their mother also seems to know what she wants, and asks for the Cobb Salad. Great; order done. I go into the kitchen, enter the order into the system, and continue helping people, as bringing the plates to the table is the job of the kitchen runner and not me. However, the runners are usually the newer employees, since it is an easier job and is helpful for learning the table layouts. Anyway, I am waiting for more tables to help when a runner comes over to me with a scowl. She tells me one of my tables is NOT happy, and that I gave her the wrong item. I was unsure of what went wrong, but I am always willing to fix a mistake.

When I get to the table, the woman tells me (in a condescending tone) ""this is not a cobb salad."" Now I should have tried to explain that this was indeed the cobb salad that she ordered, but she was so adamant that something was wrong that I simply offered to refire the ticket and make sure it was right. This satisfied her. So I go back to the kitchen, and tell the chef that we need another cobb salad. The chef is a real piece of work himself, and is either really nice or very angry (depending on how much he has had to drink that day). He looks unhappily at me when I hand him the salad, but I think he knows I am not doing this. Then he quickly makes another salad, and I return to my customer. She takes one look at the plate, obviously angrier this time, and says what I have is still not a cobb salad. Now at this point I know I'm gonna get chewed out by the chef if I bring this damned salad back again, so I instead ask her what is wrong with it. What I actually said was something like, ""Sorry about this ma'am, how can I fix this salad to your liking?"" She says, ""just bring me a cobb salad."" You know the old saying, you can't help someone who won't help themselves. So I say ""yes ma'am"" and once again return to the kitchen. The chef is so angry he is red in the face, but before he can yell at me, I put down the plate, go back to the customer, and tell her, ""I have spoken with the chef and this is his recipe for a cobb salad. If you would like a custom salad we have that option as well."" 

Then, as if the answer had been obvious all along, she points at the plate and says, ""cobb salads don't have all that dressing."" I wanted to strangle this lady, she should have TOLD ME THAT 15 minutes ago and saved us the damn trouble. But instead I was just happy that I had an actual course of action. After getting more shit from the chef, (who was actually mostly angry at the lady but cannot yell at her so gets mad at everyone) I bring her the cobb salad with no dressing, and a side of dressing for her to use as she likes. She just looks at me after I place it down, and when I ask if this is okay she waves me away. And that day I swore off cobb salads for the rest of my life.

That is pretty much it for that story, but working at a country club has given me a bunch of fun stories about entitled people power tripping and ordering around a bunch of teenagers working for minimum wage with no tips.

I work at a chain seafood restaurant that specializes in grilled fish. During lunch, we offer shrimp tacos and fish tacos. 

I’m serving a 3 top of all older women, who just find each other hysterical, which is already annoying. Before I even have a chance to introduce myself or even welcome them to the restaurant I get the typical:
“Water.” 
“Water.”
“Half and half tea with a lemon.”

Ok I already know I’m going to have little interaction with these ladies. Fine, I have 3 other tables to tend to. I grab their drinks, without a lemon, my hands were full and our lemons are served on b&amp;b plates. I drop the drinks off at the table and immediately 1/2 tea lady holds up her glass to the light and examines it declaring “hmmm...I don’t see a lemon in here!”
The tables erupts in laughter

Rolling my eyes, I promptly return with the plate of lemons.

I should win an Oscar for that smile.

Moving forward. Another lady asks if I know what gluten free options they had. I explained I could give her a gluten free menu if she would like. She accepts.

After looking at the gluten free menu, she decides nothing appeals to her and wants our fish tacos. She asks “what kind of tortillas are these?”

“They’re flour.”

“Do you have corn tortillas?”

“No ma’am, just the flour.”

“Are you serious? *scoffs* what is your problem? Who doesn’t have corn tortillas?”

I already knew where this was headed. Was frankly not in the mood to be berated because our restaurant didn’t change everything on their menu to accommodate gluten free people. 

“Is there something else you might want that’s on the gluten free menu?”

“What about these tortilla chips? (Still referencing the main menu) What kind of tortillas are they made of?”

“Well we make them in-house from our flour tortillas”

“They’re not corn?? They can’t be tortilla chips if they’re made with flour! Those aren’t real tortilla chips!”

I’m over it at this point. I’m starting to feel my blood boil but I try to just focus on the fact that if I give in to this lady, it validates her actions.

“Can I get you something from the gluten free menu?”

She turns to her friends.
“Of all the places we could have gone for lunch you took us here??”

I have no patience for bitching just to bitch so I replied,
“I’ll give you a moment.”

She ended up getting tacos without the tortillas. After all of that, She exclaimed at how delicious they were.

In closing, my reaction to this woman is not a reflection of how I feel about people who can’t have gluten. I understand that people have dietary restrictions; however, i found it absolutely ridiculous that people think that we should have a gluten free version of every dish we offer on the menu. 

TL;DR Woman started to yell at me because the corporate restaurant I work for doesn’t serve their tacos in corn tortillas.

I'm a server in a small casual-fine restaurant and bar in a rich neighborhood. 

It's a slow night, and they are my only table outside of the bar. A young couple, maybe late twenties-early thirties (I'm 25F). 

Instantly I notice that the dude is making way too much eye contact and being overly thankful. I don't think much of it, except to feel bad for the chick he's with. 

They have a glass of wine and dessert and then leave. Dude was creepy the whole time, chick hardly spoke. But they seemed like they'd been dating for a while -- we get a lot of tinder dates etc, and I didn't get that vibe. 

They leave, and I go to pick up their book. The itemized slip is flipped over, and I see a note with a phone number. I kind of roll my eyes, thinking about how inconsiderate it is to leave your number for a waiter when you're on a date. 

But then I read the note and do a double-take. 

""You are a beautiful woman. If you feel the same and are interested, give us a call [insert number].""

ok so this is kind of a rant but also, I would love to hear your comments on how other servers would handle this...

I’ll start off by saying, today I received my first ever write up, in 18 years of my working life.

I work in a cafe as a breakfast server in NYC. The place just opened up about a month ago and its attached to a hotel. BIG tourist area. Since the place opened there has been a few issues with customers not paying their checks and leaving (the cafe has bar and table seating with 2 servers on each shift as well as a separate to-go area) Without knowing the exact reason, we are believing it to be tourists/people who believe the breakfast is complimentary since the cafe is technically within the hotel. a manager suggested we ask for a credit card to pre-auth on our POS so it saves the payment info just in case, which is a good idea but doesn’t help for cash transactions, which a lot of tourists have cash.

so now on to the write-up...

At 11am I took my break, which was completely normal time. We pool tips but we use our own sign in number to open and see tables we have, so my co-worker took over watching the tables, my company allows this and kind of promotes it. breakfast just ended and we don’t have a lunch menu so it was dead. there was one 2 top, which was under my # and a few other single people having coffee. my co-server was paying attention to them. so, I go on break, come back, get ready to cash out and notice that the 2 top is still open. no credit card was ran for them so I immediately go to my co-worker and ask him. I should also mention; he greeted and took the tables order and put it under my number. He used my number because even though we don’t have ""sections"", I was mainly taking the tables outside of the bar area. I honestly had no interaction at all with the table. By 11am the morning server pretty much stops taking tables and starts to cash out. Anyway, the table did not pay. they walked out and left (presumably not knowing they had to pay...) while I was on my break. My co-worker was supposed to be watching the floor. he acknowledged that he didn’t give them a bill before they left and he even said sorry to me about it. 

I told my manager and he voided the check. but behold, at the end of my shift before he cashed me out, he wrote me up. My co-worker received a warning.

in my opinion, this is screwed up. how do I get written up for a table that walks out while I’m on my company ordered break?

How do I stop people who don’t know they need to pay from walking out?

I’ve worked in so many places and never had issues like this before. I feel the write up was unjustified and I was made an example off. I could understand if I was actually working but I was on break. is it wrong to say not my responsibility, or should I not take a break...?

Thanks for reading!

Guy: Did you not hear me? The pizza toppings and the sandwich are *DIFFERENT*!

Me: Sir, I have the menu here in front of me. We only have the Yellow Submarine as a pizza. Do you know what toppings you'd like on your sandwich?

Guy: Is \[Owner's Name\] there? She'll know how to do it.

Me: Sorry, she's not here right now.

Guy: Well is there somebody there who knows what they're talking about? Otherwise I'm gonna hang up. You have it in your little sandwich menus. You need to *find one of those* and tell me what's on it.

Me: \[*Well what the heck--there's nobody in here right now. Maybe this Magical Mystery Yellow Submarine Sandwich got lost in the menu transition, so let's dig up one of those sandwich menus.

I love this subreddit, I can relate to so many of these posts. Thought j had to share the craziest tip I've ever received. It's a bit short but the revenge was so sweet. 

I was working at a well know carvery brand here in the UK. A carvery is basically a Sunday lunch buffet every day of the week. 

This particular day I had a busy section as the hotel down the road was hosting a medical convention. My section was mainly for tables of one or two. In comes a portly doctor in his 50s who goes up for a large carvery (bigger plate, more meat and some chipolata sausages) and asks for a full fat coke. I get him his drink while he's at the carvery deck getting his food. 

I was polite through his meal, checking back, getting him a refill when requested, but didn't really have time to small talk as I had a few other tables. 

Throughout his meal I noticed he was writing something on a small piece of paper. I paid it no real mind and when it came to his bill he paid in cash. I gave him his change, thanked him for his business and left him to go on with his day. 

I wasnt expecting a tip (it's not as prevalent in the UK but it's nice to get one). He leaves and I go to clear and rest his table. I look at the bill sleeve and see the piece of paper head been writing on. I read it and was in shock to discover what he'd done. 

Now I'm a big girl. Always have been, it's a metabolism with a dash of PCOS mixed in. I don't really mind, I like who I am now. But when this happened i was 17 and had no where near the self love and confidence I do now. He had written a list of foods I should and shouldn't eat if I wanted to lose weight. This was without prompting, without us discussing my weight at all. 

I was shocked, then pissed but nowhere near as pissed as my then manager. He was beyond pissed, he was angry. He had grown up with my cousins and saw me as a little sister, so he was quite protective of me. He asked me if he was still there, I said the doctor had left. We knew he'd probably be back as the conference went over the weekend. This is when we started to plot revenge. 

Two days later he came back this time with some of his colleagues. They were seated in my friend Jake's section, who knew what he'd done, and is a vindictive SOB at the best of times. He allowed them to eat and have their meal, pulling him into a false sense of security. When it came to the check he told me to give it to them, I did. I then proceeded to give him back the note he'd left me and said ""I wanted to give this back to you. I don't require this"". 

He was shocked! He thought I would welcome his golden advice! It also piqued some interest in his colleagues. One asked: ""what is it?"" 

""Unsolicited dietary advice."" I replied, ""unneeded, unwanted and unprovoked."" 

His colleagues were shocked at his lack of tact and had gone a delicious shade of red, his mouth flopping open like a fish. They paid the bill, and made sure both myself and Jake got a tip. The rude doctor apologised, and I hope he learned a lesson that day. 

Tl:dr doctor gives unsolicited diet advice as a tip. Gets embarrassed in front of his colleagues.

I was actually hosting this day, not serving, because the restaurant needed the extra help and I needed the extra cash. 

The restaurant has 2 floors, an upper outdoor patio and a lower indoor floor. The day had started off really nice weather-wise, so the lower floor was a little slower and the patio was packed. 

Then there was some game on, so the lower floor filled up. Then the weather started to change. It started to get cold and windy. So, of course, all of the upper outdoor tables want to move downstairs. 

I was with a new host and was showing her how to do the wait list. A woman comes up and tries to seat herself at a high top right next to the host stand. I politely tell her that we are on a wait and she'll need to put her name on the waitlist if she would like a table. 

She says in a super condescending voice that ""she already has a table upstairs, and should be given priority because she's already a customer"". I explained to her that that's not how the waitlist works. It's first come first served based on party size and table availability. Just like any restaurant anywhere. 

She gets really huffy with me, but finally agrees to move and put her party on the waitlist. She says she has 8 people in her party. I let her know that my estimate for her party to be sat would be at least an hour. The game wouldn't be over until then and the likelihood of a table big enough to seat her party (or two tables close together) getting up before then was slim. Not only that, but I have a party ahead of hers for 6 that would probably take any larger table that got up first. She yells at me to ""sort it out!"" before huffing back upstairs. 

About 15 minutes later, a man comes downstairs and asks about their place on the waitlist. I let him know their wait is still probably at least 45 minutes. He says he's the huffy lady's husband, and they decided they're just going to finish their drinks and leave because they don't want to wait that long for a table. He tells me to remove their name from the list. Okay, sure. I cross it out on the sheet. 

I'm sure you all see where this is going. 

About 10 minutes later, a larger party miraculously does get up, so we bus it and set it up for the aforementioned 6 top. I go up to the patio and get them and bring them downstairs. They get situated and I hear screaming up at the front. A lot of customers notice and are watching. I rush over and see huffy lady yelling at the new host for taking their name off the list. 

I step in front of the upset host and explain that I was the one that took their name off the list. At this point my manager comes up and just stands there, watching the following discussion unfold: 

Huffy Lady: You sat a table before us! We were next!

Me: No, as I told you before, there was a 6 top ahead of you.

HL: We've been waiting longer! We deserve the table! 

Me: No, the 6 top was ahead of you on the list, so they were waiting longer. 

HL: No! YOU fucked up by taking our name off the list! And you wrote down that our party is for 8 and it's for 10! Can't you do anything right?!

Me: Your husband told me to take your name off the list because you decided to leave. I can put it back on if you would like and you'll still be in the same place. However, if your party is for 10 instead of the original 8 you told me, then I'm sorry to inform you that the wait will probably be longer because I might need 3 tables to accommodate you depending on what becomes available. 

HL: LIAR! He wouldn't do that! You're lying to cover up your own mistake! 

The Huffy Lady lets out some sort of banshee sound and stomps off upstairs. I look at my manager and ask him why he didn't step in and why he just let her scream at me. He said ""it looked like you had it handled"". I asked if he was going to go check on her upstairs and he said ""there's a manager up there"". Ugh. 

Huffy Lady led her dejected party out of the restaurant about 5 minutes later. I gave the husband a ""what the hell/ I'm sorry for you"" look. He just shrugged. She yelled something about a yelp review before she left, but I never saw anything. That manager continued to be spineless until he quit.

1) When I got to work, saw our GM talking to a very pissed off table. They wanted a beer but didn’t have their ID, only a picture of it on their phone. Server and GM both explained how that’s illegal in our state and refused to serve him. He was a part of party of 8, he walked out by himself first. Then came back in and tried telling someone different they haven’t been served yet and threatened our GM. GM takes him outside where they talk, the wife walks out yelling “this is our first and last time here!” all while basically dragging their child. 


2) Had a grandma ask me what’s the cheapest way to order a porterhouse. I showed her our porterhouse combo, to which she says, “Yeah but I can’t afford that.” (~$27) I tell her that’s the only option and smallest size so even if she wanted a different size it’d be more expensive since they’re all gonna be larger steaks. I show her different options on the menu like the large sirloin, ribeye, bone in ribeye. She said, “Did I SAY I wanted a ribeye?!” (Look lady you’re the one who came to a place you can’t afford so don’t be snapping back at ME for your poor money management skills). The table finally orders, fast forward to to go boxes! I see her putting in her box our actual plate for her side of green beans. I tell her, “ma’am we have to go containers for your sides, I’ll go get you one.” She said, “Yeah might be better than stealing from you right?!” The whole table thinks it’s cute. *eye roll* Turns out she wasn’t even the one paying! So why even make it a big deal about not being able to afford it if she wasn’t paying?! I’m sure the lady who DID pay couldn’t afford the porterhouse either which is why she didn’t tell her to not worry about it, left me $8 on $67. 


3) 8 top left me $0 on $105, ran me ragged. Gave them to go drinks and to go bread. Nothing special about them and I know it happens all the time but still sucks.",0,Easter weekend brought out the trash.,37
409,earthtoleslie,0,t3_bfzi7w,7,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bfzi7w/when_you_decide_not_to_look_at_the_menu_and_then/,"The title says it all but I’m still gonna type it out for those who come here for stories like me (First post in this sub! Im new to the restaurant business and have learned a lot here and wanted to throw mine in. Y’all inspire me.)

I work at a new Japanese restaurant (open a total of 6 weeks). We had issues in the beginning so we took customer feedback and changed quite a bit, from hours to staffing to menus to recipes, etc. Last week we finally got our brand new menus to implement all the changes. 

I seat a family and put their menus down in front of them. The dad, speaking for the mom and three daughters, says they’re ready to order right away. Five of our “signature”. No problem, I thought maybe they looked at the menus we had in the waiting area.

To set the scene, most of my shifts (including this one) I’m the only FOH person, in a 50-seat restaurant, which means I’m hosting, bussing, taking orders, serving drinks and food for the entire place. I can handle it and make *great* tips money, but it’s not easy, and efficiency is key.

The dad is visibly upset when I drop off their food, and says it wasn’t what they wanted. They wanted thin-cut pork belly and got thick-cut.

I told him that was what the Signature is (there’s a very clear picture in the menu too). He says that they’ve been here before so they didn’t even look at the menu because they got the Signature last time.

In their defense, it does sound hypocritical that we changed something called the “Signature”.

BUT

In our defense, the menus are clearly different from before!! It used to just be a single sheet of paper. Now it is one of those laminated menus with pages to flip through, color, pictures, etc. Also, the thick cut pork is our “premium”. It’s tastier and more expensive for us to acquire, even though we lowered the price of the bowl. The problem is it doesn’t necessarily look as tasty as the thin-cut.

I apologized, but (in my best customer service voice, you know the one) pointed out that this is what they ordered, the signature is cheaper than it was before, and this pork is our premium option and actually pretty delicious.

But he just. wasn’t. letting. me. leave. I’m 22 and look young/Caucasian in a Japanese restaurant and he definitely was trying to strong-arm me because he thought he was better than some lowly waitress. But my main concern is literally every other table in the restaurant is unattended now. 

He asked if I could get the manager. I said I could see what I could do. 

The fun twist: I was promoted to assistant manager the day before. Downside is I didn’t have the confidence to play the “I am the manager” card yet. The upside is I have total freedom in resolving things like this.

I attend to literally all the other tables first, out of spite for keeping me busy so long (but of course to help the other customers) and also to try to give enough time that they would be forced to consider eating the premium pork. 

Five bowls worth of thin cut pork belly would be $15 for a customer to order, and I definitely wasn’t going to give him that for free. I told my ramen chefs (who are absolutely the best, and get what I deal with) to dig deep and find all the ugliest pieces of our thin cut pork from the sides and ends that we normally wouldn’t use. Five servings volume-wise, still edible and tasty, but ridiculously ugly compared to our beautiful perfect pieces that adorn our bowls that our paying customers normally get.

I brought them his precious plate thin-cut pork belly, in all its lack of glory. “On the house”, I said sweetly (to make myself the good guy) and then whipped out the new menu and pointed out which ones have thin-cut and which ones have thick cut. “For next time!” I added, sweet again. “For next time,” he agreed. I left the menu open on their table to that page, refilled the girls’ waters, and avoided them for the rest of their time there.

As far as customer crises go, I feel like this one was a happy (or at least satisfying) ending for me. My ramen chefs and my boss all got a huge kick out of it. I said “thank you, come back soon!” as they left, but threw their tips in our tips thing without checking how much it was. I learned to stop hurting myself by doing that very early on. I only feel bad for the other four in his family. They didn’t say a word once. I hope for their sake he was just in a rotten mood and that he’s normally not such a bully, but I doubt that’s the case.",0,"When you decide not to look at the menu, and then complain your order isn’t what you wanted...",172

A little back story about how the place worked:  Only girls were servers,  we only worked for tips and at about 22:00 the barmen do stock take so we have to make our own drinks.  The owner liked to sit with customers after the kitchen closed and then the drinks are normally on the house.

Now, on to the story.  Our one large section was booked out for a 21st function and I was one of the girls that served it.  Everything went very well and as most of the people at the party was the same age as the birthday girl they all left at about 21:30 to go out and have fun.  The parents and their friends stayed to settle the bill and finish off their wine. (Got a good tip that we split among all the girls that served).  I go to the back to have a cigarette and when I come back all the girls already cashed out and left and the owner was sitting with the people left over from the party.  uurrggghhh  I know exactly what I was in for but hey, it's still kind of early so I don't mind staying and serving the boss and his guests, I mean how long can they really sit and talk.   

They finish the wine and the boss orders his usual rum &amp; coke and I take drinks orders from the rest of the table. As I'm about to go and prepare them, the boss adds, and a round of (technically difficult and a pain in the ass to make) shots.  O.K. no problem, I take them the drinks and empty the ash tray and reckon that's going to be the end of it.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!!   

Every half hour or so a round of drinks and a round of painstakingly made shots.  At about 23:30 the dad of the birthday girl feels bad for keeping me so long and hands me a large note of cash to thank me for staying.  The boss snatches it out of my hand and gives it back to the dad and says to please not insult him.   INSULT HIM!!  They order another round of drinks and shots, I make them begrudgingly and deliver them to the table.  Now I'm a bit pissed off, so I settle myself in at the bar and pour myself a drink.  (We were allowed)  Midnight rolls past and it's the same thing, a round of drinks and a round of shots. Sure, it's not like I've been  here for about 2 hours working for free.  As I get back to my spot at the bar, the dad walks by to go to the bathroom, sees me and comes in and hands me DOUBLE of what he previously gave me.  With the owner not around I thank him very much and take it. I'm grateful for this nice man and I put the cash under my pack of sigs and carry on with the last couple of duties.  I want to get out of there as soon as I possibly can. It's about 01:30 and as I finish cleaning the coffee machine the owner walks in and asks me to do my duties. I tell him that it's all done and he's happy and just said to go clean the table.  As he is about to go close up the kitchen, he sees the cash sticking out from underneath my box of smokes and asks me what that is.  I told him it was my tip money and he takes it again.  Now I'm fuming.   I mean seriously!!  To try make you look good you steal from your employees!!  As I was clearing the table both the mom and dad look at me all sheepishly, like:  we're sooo sorry.  But they thank me again and say their goodbyes.  I finish everything, redress the table and I'm out of there, absolutely livid.   I just went home to go and formulate my petty revenge.

The Tuesday after that weekend the couple was back in and asked for my section specifically.  I served them again and it was a great shift as they tipped me HUGE and said they felt so bad they had to come back and give me what they thought I deserved.

We had little boxes with jelly beans in them for each of the guests. One lady asked us if they’re peanut-free. I told her that we only used jelly beans to ensure that they were peanut-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free for all of our guests. She didn’t believe me and asked me to get the bag to prove to her that they were in fact peanut-free. I politely told her that we didn’t have the bag anymore, but that if she didn’t feel comfortable eating them, then she didn’t have to accept the candies. She got all huffy and told me how rude it was to not keep the bag. 

She then proceeds to the buffet line, where our chef did an amazing job making fancy plates for all the dishes. One was smoked salmon and was garnished with a full lemon with the top cut off in a zig zag pattern. The lady told me how inconsiderate it was to use such a garnish. Apparently we should have not used the lemon at all and given each individual guest a wedge of lemon after they were seated. Another garnish we had was the top spiky part of a pineapple on the fruit tray to jazz it up a bit. She said it, too, was inconsiderate, as that part of the fruit could not be eaten and it was taking up room on the tray that could otherwise be used for more fruit. Then she gave us a “suggestion” that our servers should be wearing white shirts instead of black as the uniform, because black disguises dirt earlier and no one can tell how clean the servers *really are*.

Today was a slow Easter Sunday, and both the dining room and drive-thru were dead. My general manager was on drive, and I was in my usual spot on the milkshake fountain, wiping down the same spinner I'd wiped ten times already. The headset dinged, and my GM answered with, ""Thank you for choosing [where I work]! What can I get fresh for you today?"" 

The customer on the other end responds that he'd like the triple and fries; GM asks if he would like the [promotion we're running], and the man responds that he would. So GM asks what additional side he would like. The man asks what we have, and GM lists them off, the same spiel as always. 

Everything seems fine until the man says that he would like the chili for his side, and GM informs him it will be a fifty-nine cent upcharge (something that happened on a corp. level, we have no control over this) and if that's okay.

In a shitty tone, the man responds, ""No, it's not okay!"" and GM hesitates for a second before asking him what he'd like for his side (seeing as he sounded as though he didn't want the chili). Indignant, the man reiterates that he'd like the chili, so the GM repeats the note about the upcharge. 

Again, the man gets upset over the upcharge. He asks to speak to a manager to which my GM gets to tell him, ""I'm the general manager."" 

By this point, one of my other coworkers slipped on a headset so he could hear what was transpiring outside at the speaker. it goes silent for a moment (my GM is *extremely* petty), before GM again asks what he'd like for his side, and asks if he needs to repeat them again. 

""No, I know what the sides are, you've told me several times!""

So GM stops responding to him by this point, and tells us that he's going to call the cops if the man doesn't order. Note that he doesn't tell the man this (who is still sitting there without saying a word). By now, he's held up out drive-thru for five minutes, and there's cars behind him. The silence continues until a *BANG* sounds outside, and he leaves. 

I later went outside (seeing as I didn't have much else to do) and it appeared that the man had punched in part of our drive-thru sign!

I Have a good degree in Economics from a major university I received 8 years ago. After college I got into the service industry bartending bc of the flexible hours and good pay and have yet to have a job that requires a degree. As I'm getting older I realize I don't want to move into restaurant management and I want to start a career before it's too late.

Also it has been about a decade so I may be a tad fuzzy on specific details. I worked at a mid range price wise restaurant through college and this is the story of my best tipping regular. 

Being in college, my work schedule was really goofy. I ended up with a Wednesday closing shift and a Sunday closing shift. Neither were very good nights and I was usually the only server after 7:30pm ish. Being that it was so slow you definitely remember regulars in an empty restaurant. 

Enter Mr. X and his girlfriend who arrived maybe 9:30pm my first Wednesday night( closed at 10pm). Nothing weird or out of the ordinary, just a normal couple.  

Fast forward to Sunday day and in comes Mr. X around 9:30pm with a different woman. When surprise surprise it is me again Mr. X makes a rather over the top “And my WIFE will have a margarita on the rocks”. I say nothing, what do I care, I have a job to do, don’t want drama and serve them as normal. I did tell the Sunday manager for giggles what was up. Mr. X was apparently pleased that I played along and tipped me $20 on a $40 check. 

The next Wednesday to my shock, he comes back in the girlfriend. I walk over, decide to be a little coy and said something to the effect of “back for your weekly fix of (what he ordered and what she ordered the previous Wednesday)?” She was all delighted that I had remembered their orders (made her feel special and such) and even told my manager that I was so much better than the previous girl who had been Wednesday’s. Almost the same bill and this time he tipped me $50. After they left I told the Wednesday manager what was up. We laughed and she told me he came in every Wednesday with the same woman. 

The entire year I had those two shifts, Mr. X came in on Wednesdays with his girlfriend and Sundays with his wife. Every single time tipping me $40-$60 on $40-$50 checks. 

I have no idea what happened to Mr. X or his girlfriend or his wife.

Friendly word of advice, cheating is wrong and you are begging to get caught if you bring your wife and girlfriend to the same restaurant as regulars.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments! Thank you to all the servers that understand. I’m hoping maybe it was an open relationship and I just misinterpreted the situation. That would make me feel better. My gut instinct based on his reaction when he saw me again that first time rubbed me the wrong way. It was always an uncomfortable situation from my perspective.

Each patient received a menu and I would offer to help the patient fill it out if they were unable to do it themselves for a variety of reasons. There were good days and bad working there, but this was one of my more memorable interactions. 

I was helping an elderly woman who was recovering from a stroke go over her menu. Her adult daughter was in the room and you could tell the she was trying to keep it together for her mom, who was still a little disoriented after her stroke.

Her daughter seems more relived that her mom is starting to come around and answer simple questions for herself. I get to everyone's favorite part of the menu, the dessert options, and it's cheesecake or chocolate ice cream. The daughter laughs and says ""Oh Mom! Get the cheesecake! That's always been her favorite!"" The mom's eyes light up at hearing she's getting cheesecake for dessert and her daughter said something about how her mom probably won't share her slice, since she loves cheesecake so much.

431,cparfa,0,t3_bfyt7n,9,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bfyt7n/crackhead_demands_a_taxi_at_office_depot_then/,"I am new to reddit, and have just joined this community. That being said, this happened last year. TLDR at end.

As a freshmen in college, I got a part-time job at Office Depot to help support my single mother with the bills related to my education (rent, food, gas in my college town). 

Now, many a crackhead had come into the store, as the area had a very active population. Not once, but twice, a heavy set, older woman who smelled like she had legitimately shit herself, came into the store during my shift. The first time, she just looked around the checkout line by the little trinkets we had for impulse buys; she left after about ten minutes. The only reason I noted this is because she had rags for clothes, and smelt awful. I felt more pity towards her than contempt. 

The second time- much different. She walked in, walked directly up to my register, while I was checking out a customer. I noticed her trying to get my attention, and repeatedly saying ""excuse me"". We were short staffed that day, and had a huge line so I pretended I was hyper-focused on checking out the customer in front of me. I hoped she would go away and find someone on the floor, but after I was finished with the current customer, she walked directly in front of the counter and into my line of vision. The next customer was already walking over to me, but stopped in her tracks, obviously annoyed. 

The crackhead, who stinks to high heaven, list off a number for me to call for her. I apologize and ask what exactly she wants. She again lists a number, but cannot remember which one is correct, and gives me two phone numbers, tells me to call both. I still ask her what she wants me to do for her, and I buzz the walkie talkie and tell my manager a ""customer"" requires help at the cash wrap. He tells me he can't help, he's helping someone else at the moment (short-staffed remember). Finally, the woman says I need to call her a taxi. The number was for a taxi service. Again, I called my manager, he told me to handle it. 

I tried to reason with the woman, and ask her to let me finish checking out the customers before I help her. She refuses to move. So I tell her I will go call, I walk over to another register, and start checking out the next customer, hoping the crackhead woman at the very least waits for me to finish with the line of people waiting. 

She didn't.

After the second customer finished, she walked up to me again and told me I need to call her a taxi. I grab Office Depot's phone, and dial the number she told me. It is not a taxi service, its a disconnected number. I tell her this, and she swears up and down it's the right one, I dialed it wrong. I tried to ask her to let me finish checking customers out, then I would help her. She then snapped at me

""I ain't standing here waiting for you to call the damn number!""

She reeks. Badly. I wanted nothing but to get away from her. She then switches her demands from a taxi, to somewhere to rest while she waits for one. She starts listing a slew of medical reasons for wanting to sit down, and threatens a compliant if I do not get her a chair to sit on. I could care less about her telling my manager anything, but I wanted her to get away from me, I was all about holding my breath. I point to a desk and chair we had at the front of the store (we had put there to sell at a discounted price because of damage upon arrival) and ask her to wait there while I call the taxi. Luckily, a coworker coming off of a very brief lunch, began to help with the customers in line. I google the number for a taxi company, and call the first one on the suggested results. 

I've never ordered a taxi before, so I did not think to ask where her destination was. I had to ask her once the man from the taxi company asked me. She told me, but not before making a snappy comment about the fact I was just ordering it. She was heading down the street. Literally one block down. To a walgreeens. The man asked me if the taxi was for me, and I said no, a woman came into my work and demand I order a taxi. 

To my shock, he describes a woman that looks and acts strangely like her and asks if it's her. I reply yes, because why else would she 'know' the number for a taxi and who else looks and acts like her. 

The man on the phone says

""Oh hell no, that bitch owes me money"".

Firstly, I had to stop from laughing at his comment and the way he choose to deliver it. Secondly, I was scared he wasn't going to come now and I wanted this woman out of my hair. I asked him if that meant he wasn't going to come get her, however, he said he would be there shortly. I hung up, and a couple minutes later, the phone rings and it's him, he's outside and asks where she is. I tell him she's sitting inside, she refused to wait for him outside. 

A man storms inside, and sees the woman sitting directly in front of the doors. She yells something at him, and he starts yelling back about her bailing on him last time. My manager, finally forced to deal with the situation unfolding, asks them both to leave. The man does not apologize, but does walk out and the woman is threatened to have the police called on her, which finally forced her to followed the man outside. He waited for her. They stood right outside the door and screamed at each other, and myself and coworkers watched in awe. 

They came dangerously close to laying hands on one another, but she was short and old and limped when she walked, so the man always seemed to pull back when it got too close to a fist fight. She was the one who wanted to hit him and swung a couple times but missed. I wish I could have heard what they said once their voices lowered, because it ended with him taking her into his taxi and they drove away.

I worked at a fast food place in highschool and a gentleman came in and bought food with these $5.00 coupon things that I had never seen before. (They were literally purchased in the 90s) They had no expiration date on them though, so I took them punches them in like like a different current $5.00 coupon after reading them and went to bag the order. I come back and hand the man his food and the following exchange happens

Me: here you go

Customer: I think you owe me some change

Me: uhhh... *Thinking* wait didn't you pay with two coupons though? 

C: yes, but they were worth $10.00, you owe me x. (Whatever x was I don't remember probably $3.00 or something) 

Me: uhh *pulled coupon back out and reread it* oh the coupon says not redeemable for cash, so I'm afraid I can't give you money back. 

C: listen here, I bought a stack of those in the 90s and I've always got my fucking change. 

I waskinda pissed off at how he was treating me.  Honestly, I'm not paid enough to care so if he had said that a bit more politely I would have just got the manager to give him his money, but I couldn't just hand him cash from the drawer. If I did, that would mean my count was off at the end of the night. So I decided to play dumb, I mean hell he's treating me like an idiot, might as well give him an idiot

Me: yeah, but, it says not redeemable for cash though.

C: I don't care what it says, you owe me my fucking money. I've never had this problem before. 

Me: I mean, they were just wrong in the past then, because they shouldn't give you cash for these. 

C: get me your fucking manager I can't believe I have to deal with this shit 

So I go get my manager and show him the coupon. I just told my manager like ""he's being a dick, if you want to give him the change that's up to you, but if I did, and I'm wrong, then my drawer would be short and I'd be in trouble."" My manager was pretty chill and went up there. 

Manager: sir, what seems to be the problem 

*Deliberation* 

Manager: ok sir, I'm going to give you the change, but I want you to know if you use those coupons here in the future, we won't be giving you any change. *Hands over money* 

Customer: oh believe me I won't ever come back to this fuckin store again. 


Please don't be a dick to people who are just doing their job, they're just trying to make money, and not get fired. Like honestly, how would I have looked at the end of my day ""why you short X?""

I finally had enough with the shitty customers, the terrible work ethics of the staff and upper management, and the long drive with even longer hours. I live in a middle-upper class KC area and finally found a serving job here that promises double the pay with half the work; the icing is that it is literally a five minute walk from my apartment. Goodbye 1 hour drive in the winter that almost killed me this year.  


So I put in my two weeks and counted down the days. I kept it to myself and let the staff figure it out because I didn't think they would care. Slowly though, as each one found out; they would tell me how sad they were that I was leaving, or would approach me ""aggressively"" because they didnt want to believe I was leavingthat the place wouldn't be as fun or cheerful because of my asshole antics. One in particular who is like a little sister to me,told me everyday how upset she will be once I am gone and that I need to come back at least one day a week for her. Even management was sad to see me go. I was so focused on how miserable the place made me that I didn't know how much of a positive impact I made on the rest of the working staff.

&amp;#x200B;

They weren't the only ones apparently. We have a few regulars that come in that I always interact with as much as I can, because they are just so positive and fun. One guy whom I dub discount Christopher Meloni, was just your average guy who had fun with the staff and drove locally. We got along swimmingly and I would always ask if he was still seeing imaginary unicorns or saving victims in New York. The other table was this lovely couple that comes in every Saturday and orders the same thing and plays cards while they wait if they weren't chatting with me about what was new in my life.  


I told them last week that today would be my last day, and they both told me they will go out of their way to come in and see me one last time the day before. I wanted them to remember me, so I painted them some goodbye cards, one of Happy! the imaginary unicorn for my Meloni, and one from a childrens book I am working on for my older couple. They couldn't believe I did so much for them, when they were the ones who did so much for me. Hell, the Meloni guy visited me on the overnight shift (10pm-6am) and we chatted for 3 hours while I didn't have any customers.  


Meloni wished me luck and hoped he would see me sometime in the future. The older couple told me to email them once I figure out my new schedule and that they would come and visit me. Some of the staff shared the same remarks and my ""little sister"" said she will be my first customer when I get my schedule figured out. Everyone stopped to give me hugs and wish me good luck and good bye, and I was taken aback because I am just so used to how shitty people can be (some of them to be included honestly). My final words to them was ""I gotta run to my car real quick."" a running joke that we shared of a server who said the same thing before she walked out, never to be seen again.

So I've been on this subreddit for a minute now but haven't really posted. Not bc I don't have stories but bc I have so many. So I decided that I'll just post my most recent and then see if I'll post more as they come. 

 So I work at a fairly well known restaurant who's main colors are red and yellow and had a whole movie made about it. If you work at one of these places you know EXACTLY what kind of ppl go here. Usually soccer mom's, entitled ppl, someone looking for something cheap, or ppl who just want something to drink. The star of this story is the ladder. So we were in the middle of a major rush I mean wait times were nearing 5-6 minutes at a minimum. Primarily bc the last shift didn't stock anything and we were running around trying to figure out what we needed and how many we needed. One of those things was a lemonade. On a normal day I probably would have replaced it right then and there but on that day not only was I already in a bad mood but we also didn't have any in the store (Yay). As I go to the pay window (backcash) she already has her money 
Now seeing as I have memory issues and this happened on a Tuesday not everything is going to be accurate.

Me: Mean Employee OL:Old lady 

Me:Hello unfortunately we've run out of lemonade can I get you anything else?

OL: So you mean to tell me I've been waiting here for 10 minutes for something you don't even have (It was like 4 minutes at most we were finally picking up) why didn't you tell me when I ordered it 

Me: Ma'am we did have it but someone has already used the last of it and- 

OL: I don't want to hear your excuses All I wanted was a lemonade and I can't even have that?

Me: I would be willing to- 

OL: Don't interrupt me (I didn't) You could have told me that you ran out of lemonade at the speaker 

Me getting frustrated with the circles we keep going around: Ma'am we did- 

OL: Where's your manager I want to talk to a manager

This is a line that I like to hear especially bc I am currently a manager in training rn and probably will be a manager by June at the latest so I whip out the end all be all

Me: I am the manager ma'am

OL without blinking an eye: I want to talk to the manager above you I want to talk to your GM (so much for that) you don't even look like a manager. 

Now my uniform was a dark blue shirt with an undershirt which was gray and black pants. Now I'm not saying that she was completely wrong in her assessment but she could clearly tell that I had some seniority over the rest of the crew. At this point though I just wanted her to either get out of my line or at least move up so I went to get my GM and she told me just to pull her up so she can talk to her. Not really looking forward to talking to this entitled bitch again but ok

Me:If you'll just move to the next window she'll be up there. 

OL: will she be up there 

Me: visibly confused and frustrated: Yes she will please move up

OL: No I'll wait here for her 

Me finally done with her shit: Ok you have two choices rn either get out of my line which you are holding up or move forward I'm done dealing with you tonight 

And I slammed the window shut. Was it the best service I could provide? No not by a long shot. Was it warrented? I could probably make a strong case for it. Was it my last time that night? If you work in fast food you already know the answer to that. 

All in all she single handedly raised our already crappy time, pretty much ran through any patience I had for the day not even a full 30 minutes into a 6h shift and managed to get denied again by my GM (God bless that woman)

Last night was an odd night because none of my tables seem to figure out what they wanted to eat or drink and many needed more time after I stopped by to take either order.

The table where I forgot the hot tea was the most annoying of them all.

I placed waters on the table (a 4-top), introduced myself and greeted them and asked them what I could get them to drink besides water. They needed a another minute. Fine, no problem. 

I go check on other tables and check back in. They want to taste a wine. This is also when person 4 orders a hot tea. Fine, no problem. I drop off the sample and run something for another table while they taste it.

I check back in and start to take their order. They have a couple questions about the menu and order nachos and person one wants nothing, person 2 just wants a soup and what do ya know person 3 needs more time. 

At this point I'm afraid to start neglecting my other tables so I give this table about ten more minutes while I run around for a bit (we were pretty busy). 

I get back to their table and they add another soup, a small salad and 2 glasses of the wine they tasted. At this point I've completely forgot about the hot tea and continue with my night.

Their food goes out, I fill up their waters and ask if they need anything and everyone is good.

They pay, leave a decent tip and goodbye.

They never brought back up the hot tea and today after the brunch rush I get a weird feeling that I'm forgetting something. I stand in the server station and think for a minute and realize that I had forgot this stupid hot tea last night.

&amp;#x200B;

The highest points is 10 which the bartender always gets because they close. The servers work off that and get less depending on when they're cut. The runner gets 7 and the busser can get up to 6 but sometimes get less depending on when they finish. The host gets 2.

&amp;#x200B;

My first issue is the host gets paid $20 and hour and it seems bizarre to include them in the tips as well. (NYC restaurant)

Also, the tip pool just doesn't work out very fairly. For example tonight, I was slammed the entire time I was there but got cut first. Looking at the tip breakdown later I see I made the most in total tips, but bc I got cut first I made 30 less than the other server and bartender. Am I being unreasonable to be annoyed?

Last night I was serving on the floor and had to close. Overall the night was pretty good, I got lucky with a couple of higher than average checks and higher than average tips which was great. 

Towards close, maybe one or two hours before we lock the doors, I get sat with a table of 6. Two older ladies (30ish and 50ish, possible daughter and mom) and four kids ages 6 to maybe 15. Off the bat I had a bad feeling about the table based on how they responded when I greeted them.

I started asking for drink orders and these people were so weird about ordering, talking really slow or just not answering me at all. Whatever I get their drinks and try to be as kind and understanding as I can. One of the kids asked for queso, since I had a bad feeling I double checked with the mom. She asked me how much it would cost so I showed her the item in the menu. 

Mom:  “Hellll no! You want queso and nachos?”
Kid: “For the chips.”
Mom: “Nope, uh uh. Tell her what you’re eating.” 

I then go to the kid and she tells me she wants nachos with no guacamole or lettuce or pico.
Me: “okay no problem, did you want any meat on your nachos?”
Kid: “no, just nachos with no lettuce or guac or pico.” 

The restaurant I work at has three types of nachos, only one of them has meat on them and obviously they’re slightly more expensive because of this. Don’t forget, I asked this girl if she wanted meat. I take all the orders, they’re all sort of weird, and stingy. The youngest kid wasn’t allowed to get any food, another kid got one a la carte taco, and the other kid got two tacos in a meal (which is basically the exact same cost as getting two tacos a la carte and I asked the kid if she wanted rice and beans). The mom got fajitas, the most expensive item on the menu.

Before I had even left the table (they ordered everything at once, so they still didn’t have drinks) the mom asks me how long the food will take. I told her I didn’t have a specific time frame but I could check with the kitchen for her. I asked if she would like the checks brought out right then since she was worried they would be late to a show and she said that’d be great. So I ring in everyone’s food, print the checks, make the drinks, pass out the drinks, pass out the two bills (mom and 3 kids) (other lady), overhear the Mom sound shocked that the bill is almost $50 as I was talking to another table. Come back, pick up their cash and tell them I’ll be back with the change. 

While I’m busy with my other tables the food gets ran to their table. I walk up to check on everything as the server who was passing it out says there’s a problem with the nachos. I ask the table what’s wrong and I shit you not they say “these nachos don’t have no meat on them.” I told them that we had three types of nachos and that I was sorry for the confusion and could get them nachos with meat. They asked for ground beef so I went to the back planning to just ask the kitchen to put some beef on the nachos that were “wrong.” BUT the other server threw away the entire plate of nachos! I ring in new nachos on the fly, get the original nachos comped off, reprint the ticket (increased from $48 something to $51.50) and bring back the tabs to the table with the change.

Fast forward, kid has new nachos, everyone’s happy with their food, and I drop off the Togo boxes the mom asked for. And then, she spoke.

Mom: That was your tip you know?
Me: I’m sorry, what?
Mom: Well I didn’t know it was going to cost extra for those nachos and all that cash on their was for the bill and your tip.
Me: I’m sorry, meat costs extra and the only way for me to get it is to ring in what I need. 
Mom: Yeah well it’s not my problem is it? That was your tip.
Me: ....
Mom: That was your tip, that’s all I’m saying.

At that point I just walked away and tried to keep my cool. It doesn’t sound as horrendous as it felt, but I wish I could paint this lady’s tone and attitude into this because it was the cherry on top.

Once the party finally left I walked back over to help bus the table and noticed that both tickets had nothing left on them, which I expected. It sucked nonetheless to get stiffed on their combined $67 table though after how much they had me running and the way they talked to me. I was fuming and it took me a good 20 minutes to chill out.

441,Aqualava,0,t3_bfvvrv,8,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bfvvrv/would_you_stay_or_go/,"This is not my 1st serving job, and I know it can be a shit show at times.

I am used to fine dining. I was recently hired on at Very Fancy Seafood as a server. When I introduced myself to the person I was supposed to train under, they immediately handed me off to someone else. My 2nd trainer was much more helpful, but 20 min into the shift, they got super swamped, and left me on my own without explaining what they were doing or why.

When I was trying to watch them enter their order into their PoS, I was politely chided by a manager to always be doing something. I get the sentiment. I really do. Serving is like riding a bike. It's not hard to pick up when you've done it before. But really? You're supposed to be training me today. Sure, throw me to the wolves. I can train myself, and do what *I* feel needs to be done based on *my* experience. But you're setting yourself up for failure if you want me to abide by *your* standards. Plus, it's not like I know where anything is, having just started.

Anyway, I pop on the bar because there's only one bartender. I'm told I'm doing a great job, blah blah. Then they pull me aside to perform busser tasks all evening. Polishing. Stocking. Trash. Water. They kept apologizing, but it quickly became very clear that they are severely understaffed and unorganized. Their dry storage is in multiple, seemingly random rooms. They had one food runner, no back waiters, missing table numbers, and no seat numbers. Their schematic does not match the building floor plan. Management was also taking tables, which made it hard to get them when you needed something... and they insisted on being the ones getting drink orders if a bartender wasn't available.

I wasn't even registered in their system, and they wanted me to take random tables. Sometimes, they were like ""someone, anyone take these guys, they've been waiting for x minutes!"" I also saw what looked like servers grabbing other server's tabs to close them out?

I figured I would give Very Fancy the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it was just a bad day, or a bad day for me to train. But these little things keep adding up. Another example: every time I try to contact management for anything... I never get a call back. Most recently, I was promised to hear about the next schedule days ago, and here we are... the new week approaching... in hours... and no word. I can't work for you if you don't tell me when you want me to come in.

I was eating when this customer came in so I stopped to greet and took his order, I was hungry so I tried to get everything he might need, utensil and drink, etc. I went back rushing finishing my food and he asked for a knife few moments later, I stopped my meal again and got him a knife (After I swallowed all my food of course) and he told me that “I am a regular here and you didnt care about the customer”. I was shocked a bit, he still left us a 20% tip but I want your thoughts on the situation.

Extra info: 1 of the servers was in the back cooking food, the other one was preparing also giving the food to the customer, im sure he already asked the customer if he needs anything after giving him the food.

I worked open-close today with a 45 minute break so I was on the floor for roughly 11 hours. Didn’t make shit.

I serve at a Cajun restaurant, and I love our restaurant (managers, cooks, bussers etc.) but Jesus Christ our guests push me to my limits. Needy, rude and never seem to tip more than 5$ no matter the price of the bill. I’m a great server, I know I am and my staff and managers are always complimenting me on my work ethic but I always make shit money

I know that this post is gonna get me a lot of hate, and I’m ok with that, but I should say that I’m a white guy. Being a Cajun restaurant, our guests are probably 80% black. A lot of them are great, there’s always good banter and compliments on my service, but the tip never reflects anything like that. It kills me seeing all my hard work turn in to nothing at the end of the meal. I’ve spoken to a handful of our black servers, as all of us but 4 are black, and they all make twice as much if not more than me, and a lot of them are verryyyy sub par servers. 

I know that I could easily leave, I have a job basically lined up for me at a high end restaurant but I really do love my restaurant and plan on working my way to management there. I’ve spoken to my managers and they agree that I’m a great server and would fit the position for a manager once I get some more experience, but I swear if I get stiffed on one more $150+ tab I’m going to lose it. That happened 3 times today, with no tables having anything but great things to say about the meals and service. 

Obviously everyone in this sub knows this, but if you can’t afford a tip, you can’t afford to eat out, but if you’re tab is 150$? You can afford at least a 15$ tip.

&amp;#x200B;

We had this 4 top come into our smoking section/bar area, seated themselves, had to go to the back to get menus.  They look like they are work colleagues, i give them the menus and this one guy starts complaining on how long it took to get menus and mumbles under his breath that he hopes this isn't going to be the level of service all throughout the meal.   Uughh.  One of those pedantic people that belittles servers so he can look good in front of others.  OK.  So i take their drinks order and as we are basically next to the bar the bar staff hear the order and starts getting it ready.   Standard stuff, a Coke, 2 glasses of wine and a cider.  I take the drinks to them and Mr. Pedantic slams the Coke on the table and says, ""I asked for a Coke Zero!!!!""  and scoffs.  I apologise for both me and the bar staff both mishearing and get him a Coke Zero. 

His optic nerves are very well trained as he rolled his eyes every time i try speak to him.  They call me over to place the food order and as i'm taking it Mr. Pedantic's phone rings. He gestures to the rest of the group to order for him and goes outside to take his call.   They order for him, i write everything down as to make sure it gets put in correctly and read it back to them to make double sure.  They are satisfied so i go put it in.  All steaks with different toppings and sides, but all medium.    This guy is still outside on his phone when the food comes out.   His colleagues tuck in happily and by the time they were all pretty much done Mr. Pedantic finally graces us with his presence again.   

He sits down and immediately calls me over.  ""I wanted my meat medium rare and you gave me fries, I CAN'T EAT CARBS!!!  Take it away this instant and get me what i asked for.""  I'm kind of taken aback and reply: ""I'm sorry sir, but your colleag......"" ""I don't care, get me what i wanted""  So now i'm trying to pry out what exactly he wanted, medium rare, ok fine, but what side? Of course his colleagues doesn't come to my rescue at all but hey. He finally says: ""Oh my goodness, how difficult is it to write down S-A-L-A-D.""  I take his plate and get the kitchen on his new order.

The kitchen was nice enough to make the order as quickly as possible and i take it out to him.  ""Here you go sir, i hope you enjoy it.""   He replies: ""Don't be sarcastic little girly, now shove off so i can FINALLY eat"" His phone rings again and he gets up. It's about 20 minutes before he comes back in and calls me over again.  ""This is cold!!!""  Here i'm thinking: Yes, you were on a call for 20 minutes, food tends to get cold if you leave it that long.  But i say: ""Would you like me to reheat it for you?""   He then says ""yes of course, it should of been hot when it got here""  I go and heat his food and basically wishes this table will just ask for check and get out.  

Now my manager was sitting at a table close by and has seen everything that was going down because she was placing orders for the week. She does it on her phone because of predictive text so it's quicker than typing out an email.  She has had enough of this man and get's up while i'm warming up his food.  She went to the table and with her best service smile asks the table if everything is ok.  Mr. Pedantic then starts: ""your server is very rude and useless at her job.""  My manager then sticks up for me and tells him that his colleagues ordered his food wrong, not the server and that his food was cold because he was on a call.  He is not happy about this at all and says: ""What do you know, you're just sitting there playing games on your phone""  I then walk in with his now scorching hot food and place it in front of him.  My manger then says: ""Ok, if that will be all i will arrange the check""  Which he replies: ""I might be having dessert so no""    Thank the heavens for this manager as she very politely said to this man: ""No you won't be having dessert here sir""  He was appalled by this but by then the rest of the table just wanted to get out of there.   

Apparently he phoned the restaurant over the next couple of days and kept trying to get into contact with the owner, when he did he complained about everything and told only his side of the story and of course both me and my manager gets a stern talking to.  We explained to him exactly what happened and he understands.  A week later he comes in again and i told the owner that he was the one that complained unfairly.  The owner goes to him and tells him straight that if he doesn't treat his employees with respect that he will no longer be welcome here.   He was a bit flabbergasted, but agreed and since then he treats us great and tips well.   He is now a regular, comes in almost every Thursday and even knows our best grillers name.  He only orders steak when he's on shift.

I remembered the mother and father from a year ago, though they had been in during the holidays. I did not recall the daughter, but she was in school in Md and may have not joined before.
The mother volunteered the father's condition, that he had a rare cancer, that they commute frequently between coastal carolina and North near NYC. He was being treated in New Jersey, one of the few clinics for this particular cancer, but had bought a home here in 2014 before the diagnosis. They had just gotten good news of treatment in a local facility, that they may not have to travel as frequently. 
The man coughed a lot, a straining, gut-level expulsion of a cough. He sort of lulled in his movements. He was not well. In the end, he explained that he was a retired police chief. He loved this area. He held my arm and handed me a cash gratuity. Told me I did a great job and thanked me multiple times. 

What I do isn't hard, but it is complex, a fugue of fluid dynamics. There is a technical knowledge, layers of protocol, balancing the customer's expectations to the restaurant's current capabilities, balancing the restaurants goal's of profit with the guest's goals of hospitality, and managing a kind demeanor when guests, coworkers, life, what-the-fuck-ever, make patient equanimity a challenge. 

I was bummed last night because I missed my son's first at-bat. He managed a pop fly and got to first before he was called out on a fair catch. I had to watch on cellphone video. A personal moment I missed while helping to craft another family's moment. 

However, the repertoire one builds with guests is also an important part of my daily experience. It feels good when my minor role gets it right, when these vignettes unfold like paper dolls after the strange cuts of circumstance. 

I take a pride in what I do for a living. That man had a full belly, warm with good food among a terrible sickness, and his family had good food, good moments, and a few moments that may have felt normal and reassuring.

I felt bad that we ran out of chicken and we had to cook more in our oven, which was a wait time of 30 minutes minimum. I really did feel bad. Now I’m just pissed off. I don’t even remember everything she said to me, but the ones I remember she repeated about 20 times. 

So HW comes in with another lady, quite literally, just as we had put in some chicken to be cooked (due to some online and phone orders, we suddenly only had a half chicken available) and my initial ‘vibe’ off of HW was at Least polite. But that all changed when I informed them that there was unfortunately, a 30 min wait on chicken. The second I said ‘wait time’, her WHOLE attitude changed. 

HW: so how long is the wait?

Me: I’d say about 30 minutes until we get it cooked enough to eat?

HW: ok. 30 minutes. I want it well done. CRISPY in 30 minutes. 

Me(to myself) but it won’t be ready. 

Me: ok, if you would like it well done it’ll take maybe 10 minutes extra?

HW: I’ll come back in 30 minutes. 

So she pays. And while looking for her wallet, leaves her drink bottle on my counter. And walks off. So I move the bottle out of the way a bit and so another customer doesn’t take it and take more orders. 

Now by the time the chicken is out of the oven, we basically have a full grill. And the second we put her chicken on the grill, she struts back in. I notice her and grab her bottle, smiling all the while. 

Me: oh, you left this here when you left!

HW: oh thank you. Is my food ready?

Me: (I point towards our grill) we just put yours on, It’ll be about 20 more minutes for yours to be well done. 

HW: 20 minutes? But you said it’ll only be 30 minutes!

Me: yes, but you ordered your chicken well done, which takes a bit longer. 

HW: (getting visibly ticked off) fine. I want another half chicken. 

Me: not a problem!

So she pays for more chicken and leaves her drink bottle again! 
I go to the grill boy (GB) and inform him she wants more chicken and to cook them together (he’s a recent hire) and her gives the ok and we both start completing orders waiting on the chicken. 

And as we are working I notice that her chicken *isnt cooking* 

Me:  crud. 

Me:(to GB) hey GB, this order isn’t cooking, can you swap it with this one?

GB: no, that’s a dine in order that’s been waiting. 

Me: ok, swap it ASAP tho, this order is supposed to be well done. And she’s going to be back soon. 

Not even 2 minutes after I said this, she’s back. 

Me: hi, HW, unfortunately something seems to have gone wrong with our grill and your order wasn’t cooking properly, we’ve moved your chicken and it should be another 10 minutes? I’m so sorry for asking you to wait. (While talking with her I hand her back her bottle) 

HW: what? Why? This is ridiculous! (Sorry I don’t really remember this part of the conversation, but I’ll never forget this next part) you’ve given my chicken to someone else!

Me: I’m sorry what?

HW: you have! You just don’t want to tell me! 

Me: ma’am,  I can assure you that is *not* the case. We *do not* hand out chicken to different customers

HW: it’s ok if you’ve given my chicken to someone else I won’t be upset! Just tell the truth! *stop lying*

Me: ma’am. That (points to grill) is your chicken. Our grill appears to have malfunctioned. I apologize, sincerely apologize, that you have had to wait so long. 

HW: (her voice gets louder as she rants this bit, gaining the attention of *all my other customers*) your service is horrible! It is! You think your horrible service is ok? You think you can get away with treating customers in such an awful way? You should be ashamed of this!

Me:(close to tears at this point) I’m sorry. But it will be another (checks the time) 4 minutes. 

HW stomps off, *again* leaving her bottle behind, and I walk out of my other customers eye sight. And cried tears of frustration. I *hate* that she had to wait so long. I *hate* that she took her frustration out on me, and I know it’s a part of the job, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less when they attack something I am *proud* of. I am proud of my service, I’m a damn good waitress! Been in the industry for almost 8 years! And not a *single* person, before the other day, has *ever*. Targeted my service, and called it horrible. And I felt *sorry* for this woman! I was going to comp her a couple free drinks and coupons for the wait, *against company regulations*. Not anymore. She isn’t getting *anything* extra from me. 

And you may be wondering how she got free food? Well, HW was waiting for me once I’d calmed down enough to go back to serving (so a few minutes) and demands...

HW: I want a refund!

What every server just loves to hear!

Me: ok, I’ll have to grab my manager and she will handle the refund ok?

PLEASE NOTE, by this time her food was ready. Boxed up, but I told GB to hold it by the grill for a bit, HW didn’t want it anymore apparently. (And I think she heard me say this, or maybe she wants a complete idiot and noticed the chicken I said was hers wasn’t on the grill anymore)

So I got my most amazing and wonderfully perfect in every way Manager ( I’ll call her BM for best manager, I really get along with her) and broke down crying again and by this point, I was sick of this woman and wanted her out of my store. 

(Oh a bit of store layout, so my manager was in the office, which you can kind of see from the dining area at a certain angle. And if someone is sitting on the office chair working on the computer, you can see them, and if they turn in the direction of the dining area, they can see you)

Anyway, back to the drama!

Me: hey BM, this lady wants a refund for (her order) bc it’s taking too long. 

BM: okay Imiyaki, hey why are you crying?

Me: it’s completely stupid. But I’m upset at HW’s tone and her words are really mean. 

BM: it’s not stupid! You sit here, have a drink(she passes me my water bottle) calm down, and I’ll deal with her ok?

Me: ok. 

And I’m only slightly ashamed to say I sat and burst into tears again. Mainly angry at myself for getting so upset over something so minor, I mean really, her *tone and mean words upset me*

Oh, and while I was crying, I called over GB, and *locked eyes* with HW, and she was *smug*. I could have done some petty revenge, but I was so over her, I decide she wasn’t even worth it. 
So I asked GB if he could *pretty please* make sure HW got her bottle she’s repeatedly left on my counter? I describe it (it’s the only bottle on the counter) and ask him to just wait for a break in the convo between BM and HW and just hand it to her (again, he’s a recent hire) and he agrees and leaves me alone. 

So I can’t really hear what’s going on, but I catch a few words, such as ‘horrible service’ and ‘lying employee’. But my manager gives her a refund, and since she seemed like she wanted to complain to head office, which would get *me* into serious trouble, all but throws the cooked whole chicken at her, nothing else, just the chicken. And all but tells her to get out. 

BM comes back to check on me and make sure I’m ok, and wants to send me home (she’s *never* seen me upset at work, she’s *seen* me take worse) but I assure her I’m ok to work and I keep working.  

When I stepped back into the dining area, my other customers actually came up to the counter (I was fiddling with our drinks display) and said goodbye and have a good night. All with smiles. Honestly made the whole ordeal a bit better, but the cherry on top of the whole cake? *she left her bottle AGAIN*

I was tempted to just throw it out, but I put it under the counter and if it’s still there tomorrow, I’m throwing it out. 

And I know the wait time was a bit ridiculous, but that’s the unfortunate circumstance. We can’t always predict when we’ll get 3 orders with multiple whole chickens in them, but we always give as accurate wait times as possible, and we comp *generously*. Usually some chips or something. But I was willing to pay for this woman to get more things for free, and I may not have mentioned it to her, but at the end of the day, she doesn’t deserve my generosity nor my money and I’m glad I didn’t tell her about my plan to comp her for the wait.

At this point the oldest member of the party speaks up: Is it always policy to add gratuity on parties of 4 or less?

Me: Of course not sir, gratuity is added on parties of 6 or more.

Customer: ""Well you added gratuity to all of our checks, and we (pointing to himself and the 3 other members of his check) are a party of 4. They (again pointing, and at this point raising his voice) are a party of 3, and he is a party of 1""

For the first time in a long time I am completely speechless. He thought that breaking up the parties checks meant that they we're no longer a party of 8 people, but rather 3 separate ""parties"" that happened to share a long table.

Me: ""I do apologise for the confusion, but you arrived and ate as a party of 8. Separate checks does not equate to separate parties."" (As nicely as I can going full Customer Service voice and smile)

Customer: ""But we are 3 different parties, all under 6 people. I demand you take these off! With the service you provided, you don't deserve a damn cent."" (Again much louder than his previous speech, and on cent he slammed the table slightly) 

Me: ""Again I apologize for any confusion, but gratuity is included on parties of 6 or more, and you are a party of 8. How would you like to pay for those checks?""

At this point he realizes he isn't going to get away without leaving a tip, and has made a scene for my whole section. He ninja stars his credit card at me, and I pick up the other 2 checks (they had cards sticking out of them"".

They didn't say a word as they left, but u wonder if they tried this trick at other restaurants and got away with it?

TLDR: Split checks on large party, they want gratuity removed because they we're ""no longer a large party""

I have to say I’m pretty patient and decent at my job. I work at a local upscale steakhouse. But last night i had the pleasure of serving the trashiest humans ever.

It’s a 4 top of two couples, a younger couple and an older couple. 

Older couple orders mixed drinks, and younger couple orders drinks as well. I card the younger couple. The younger woman huffs and says she doesn’t have her ID. I tell her that unfortunately if she cannot produce a form of government issued ID I cannot serve her alcohol. She backs down and I leave the table to go ring in their drinks.

I come back with the alcohol for all the of-age guests. The older couple steps in and decides to try and persuade me to serve the younger woman. 

“This is ridiculous she’s 24 years old, get me a manager. You should serve her.”

At this point my soul leaves my body because I know this night just got exponentially more difficult for me.

“I’m sorry sir but I will tell you exactly what my manager will tell you. In (my state) it is illegal to serve alcohol to someone without government issued ID. I would be happy to serve her when she can give me her ID. If you’d like to speak to a manager about this issue further I can go get her.”

He starts to bargain with me at this point.

“Well can’t you just serve her? Bend the rules? I swear she’s 24. We can keep this between us.”

First of all my guy, what the hell. You and your trashy family aren’t worth me losing my job and potentially getting fined thousands of dollars.  
 
“Sorry sir, I like my job and I don’t plan on getting fired anytime soon.” 

At this point the older woman begins to roll her eyes at me, and scoffs. 

“Whatever this is ridiculous.”

I walk away. They try to convince me one last time to serve her. In the end the younger woman ends up figuring out where she left her ID at. She has the older man at the table LEAVE THE RESTAURANT to go pick it up. He comes back and slaps the ID on the table. 

I have at least 7 plates in my hands trying to bus my other tables, and they have the freaking nerve the ask me to check her ID then and there.

I’ve been a server at this restaurant for maybe 6 months and I get along pretty well with everyone. Obviously, we all have bad days and have little disagreements here and there, but nothing major. One particular server, let’s call her Kat, is older and has been serving for awhile. She’s a full time server and has been working there for around a year or so. Well Kat is known for becoming very stressed when busy and often starts to yell at people or become very passive aggressive. We always got along, but it seemed like every shift she would pick on one specific server. This server and I quickly became close and Kat seemed to not like that. Myself and this other server are very relaxed and try to stay out of all drama. We come in, do our jobs, and leave. Now it seems Kat has decided I’m the worst. Last week she accused me of spilling a drink on the floor and not cleaning it up (I didn’t). She said “this bitch spilled a drink and left it for me” after I left. It was about 4oz of water under a table so obviously it was an accident. She continued to talk shit about me for another 15 minutes then let it go (my friend texted me all about it). I decided I wouldn’t let it affect me too much. Fast forward to today and all was well between us. Then I get a table around 3:15 of two women. I’ve had them before and one is kind of needy, but they’re friendly and tip well. My shift is over at 4, but I’m used to being there after if I have tables. After they’re finished eating they ask for another round. By the time they finish this round it is 4:45 and they wave me over to let them know another woman is joining and she will want food and drinks as well. Since I knew they would be there for another hour plus i asked them if I could transfer them or close out to another server whose section they were in. They immediately closed out and I let Kat know they wanted to close out, but another lady is joining and she wants a beer and food. KAT GETS PISSED. She goes I don’t want those white trash bitches, but I guess I have to. I stood there shocked because we do this all the time when our shifts are over. I ask her in the back what’s wrong and she tells me I should have transferred them so she could have at least gotten the tip. I told her they wanted to close out and they’re still ordering so I don’t understand the big deal. She walks away and I ask my manager if I did anything wrong and he basically says no and she’ll just have to get over it. I leave for the day and my friend texted me that she threw a silverware bin at the wall and said how she hates me. A little more backstory about Kat is that she fights with two managers all of the time. Managers and other employees say that she is psycho and has done this to everyone at some point. 

Sorry it’s so long I just have to get it off my chest. I’m not playing stupid and exaggerating how bad she is. If anything I’m under exaggerating. I don’t like fighting with people and I’m getting to the point where I can’t work with her. I’m upset and don’t understand why she’s chosen to pick on me. I help clean tables, run food, and do side work. Was I wrong for not transferring the table? We’ve done this a million times before so I was just so confused. The table was in her section and if I stayed I would have had it for another hour and a half. Just a little upset over here.",0,Dealing With a Difficult Coworker,14

for those of you who don’t know, a mirena is an iud (a form of contraception) that is inserted into a woman’s uterus and replaced (or taken out) every five years. a lot of women will keep their first ones as a symbol or a commemorate stamp of their first iud.

now this thing was literally covered in blood. it was disgusting. it was the right size and shape for an IUD too, and it looked like blood on it (i would know what a mirena looks like bc i have one).  i took a picture which i would share but this won’t let me put up a picture.

the people who were there were 4 30 year old (ish) ladies and one very gay man who was talking very loudly about his ability to perform oral sex...this whole bunch was new to us because we usually don’t deal with people who aren’t family friendly. anyways, they were being super loud and obnoxious, and one woman had been talking about getting her mirena our that day, but i didn’t think she’d leave it for us!!!

Personally, I have a couple different strategies. If no one has specifically asked for the check, but the table has told me that it'll be on one check, I usually just place it in neutral ground in the center of the table. If they're about the same age and both ask for the check, I try to go with whoever asked first, unless the birthday person is trying to pay. If it's an older guest trying to treat their family, I just go with who's more authoritative, if that makes sense.

467,agent_kestrel,0,t3_bf9uy8,20,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bf9uy8/had_a_guest_steal_money_from_me_tonight/,"So here we are, another busy Friday night. I got one of those ""super fun tables"" (mild sarcasm) that already had a few rounds at the bar, already ate, are just going to sit at a table to drink more because their wives showed up. Whatever, it's cool, I'll roll with it.

I definitely rolled with it when the one gentleman at the table was super awesome. He had already had a few drinks, was feeling good, and was just one of those guys that is just genuinely nice. He bought the round of drinks, roughly three beers, a vodka soda, and two shots. The tab was around $44 when all was said and done. During the hour he was under my care, he was personable and fun, and even came over to one of my other tables to ""help"" me take a picture of them as they were all taking shots. I dropped the check off to him with a ""Hey thanks, boss, you have a good night"". He winked at me and wished me the same.

I walked past the table two minutes later and could actually see into the check presenter because the pen propped it open. This kind gentleman had a $20 sitting in there! I was so excited, it was one of those ""feels good to click with a guest moments"". After a bit he and his wife leave, and his friend and friend's wife stay there to finish their beers. No big deal! I'll leave the check presenter there while they finish, since I have four other tables that need my attention, and I generally don't like grabbing them up while guests are still sitting there.

Maybe five minutes later a coworker brings me my book ""Hey I cleaned your table, wanted to bring this to you""

Except it now has $15 in it.

I know I'm not crazy. I know what a $20 bill looks like. I go to the manager and explain ""Hey, I know this book had a $20 in it, can we just check the cameras, see if maybe he changed his mind? I would feel better about it, I don't want to point fingers, but I SAW that $20..."" So what I see is after the gentleman leaves, this guy finishes his beer with his wife, takes the book and opens it, takes the $20 out, hands it to his wife, and she rifles through her wallet and puts $15 in there.

I'm genuinely pissed, man. That was NOT his tab, nor was it his tip. It was NOT his place to take money that someone else left out of their own generosity. I understand that even $15 on a $44 tab is a very nice tip, but it's not the money that has me fuming, it's the principle of the matter. What gives you the right to take that five extra dollars your friend chose to leave me?? In essence you not only stole from me but you stole from your own friend!

IDK, man. I'm just salty.

Apologies for formatting, I’m a mobile user etc. etc. Wording might be a little strange - it’s 1am and I’m typing this before sleeping in preparation for a 8am start. ^^;

I’ve been a waiter since I was 14 - I’m 23 now so a good 9 years. I wouldn’t say I’m perfect, but I’m fairly good, I know my way around serving customers, making drinks, slapping on a fake customer service smile &amp; voice and whatnot. I’ve recently (as in, this week is my first week) started working full time front of house at a nearby cafe, finally leaving the part time work I have done for 9 years at my first place of work (I have had other jobs in the meantime, it’s not been one place for 9 years.)

The application process was suspiciously quick - applied start of one week, had a trial shift offered by the end of said week, was offered the job a week after. With how fast they got me in I was definitely preparing myself for some bs. 

Today has been day 3 of starting the new job, and so far I’m loving it - it’s a nice change of pace from my old job, and I’m working as part of a team opposed to normally working solo or as part of a pair at my old job. There’re a few people who work there that I recognise but for the most part it’s all new faces which has been kinda terrifying. I get really bad social anxiety and the potential to mess up around new people who are training and observing me really freaks me out. 

At the start of my first shift I asked the boss, supervisor and shift leader to give me any criticism and pointers they have for me outside of the standard “this is how we do things here, this is the daily routine, this is the schedule for tasks” etc., and today on day 3 my boss finally had something to say. 

Boss: “You asked for criticism yeah?”

Me: “I did! I know I’m not perfect.”

Boss: “Well I don’t have any. I’m seriously impressed, it’s like you’ve been here for years.”

She could’ve left it at that and I would have been happy, but as the supervisor and shift leader appeared they chimed in to continue the praise train.

Supervisor: “I was speaking to [BOSS] earlier and we said that if your old place offers you deals and tries to get you back that we’re absolutely not letting you leave.”

Shift leader: “You’re asking questions that people who have worked here for years don’t ask and get wrong, you’re doing better than pretty much everyone we have, it should be just me, you and [SUPERVISOR] working as we really don’t need anyone else now.”

I don’t know what it is, but hearing the three people who are in charge have such nice words of approval and appreciation for me just really pulled at my heartstrings. None of my old bosses have said anything like this to me. At an old job I learnt how to do everything so I could be as good of a member of staff as possible and my old manager responded by trying to get me fired just because she didn’t like my attitude and thought I was trying to run the place. So hearing praise for getting stuck into a new job and having all my effort pay off has really made me feel appreciated for once and it’s given me high hopes for the future at the new job.

I know it’s not a tale of a customer singing my praise, but it’s made my week and I’m just really happy I accepted this job now. If y’all do want some drama then I have a 9 year backlog of customers I can file through for you - as well as tales of my old evil manager. Have a good day!",0,Nicest words I’ve heard in 9 years,623

This happened just a couple nights ago. I was working the back room of our restaurant and got hit with a pretty decent pop. 2 4 tops, 3 2 tops, and a party of 11. No big deal, chips and salsa for everyone, grab drinks, take orders, and then wait. And continue to wait. And continue to wait. Wait an uncomfortable amount of time. 

We were pretty heavily staffed this night so our kitchen manager was in the window and we had our two food runners, so servers were not supposed to be going into the kitchen. We have a big issue of 11 people crowding the window and simply causing havoc. So spent my time hanging and chatting with my tables. 

At the 25 minute mark, I popped my head in the kitchen to double check on food, KM says its still down on Steam. Mildly frustrating. No big deal. I fill my tables in. Another 15 minutes go by and I head to the kitchen because the food I’ve ordered should have been out long ago. KM is nowhere to be seen. I see different departments of my food, but simply missing the hot entrees. 

4/6 tickets are gone. Nowhere to be seen. Begrudgingly I manage to get all my food out and get stiffed on 2/5 even after buying them dessert. Frustrating but understandable.  My last table left is my party and they can tell I’m frustrated, but they’ve been phenomenal the whole time. 30th birthday so as long as they had their drinks, they were in a good mood. 

As I’m putting together their tickets, one of the guys stops me and asks if we do anything special for birthdays. While we typically sing and give out a sombrero, we only had myself and the other closer left. I apologetically inform them and he jokes about tipping me extra if I pie her in the face. The entire table ERUPTS in laughter. So naturally, I go to the back and get a save-a-day of whip cream and sneakily make my way back out. The ENTIRE table sees me coming minus birthday girl. They’re barely able to contain their laughter. 

Now mind you, I’m a pretty big guy. It’s hard not to see me, so I feel like she almost has it coming. But I get behind her and SPLAT, face full of whip cream. Table cheers, she’s laughing hysterically and as I’m walking away, I feel a cold, wet thump hit the back of my head. 

My sister hung out in my section and informed them my birthday was the previous Saturday, so birthday girl took the whip cream I hit her with and threw it at the back of my head.

My boyfriend and I have been working at a new venue for just over a month (he's a bartender, I'm a server). The launch has been a shambles - we received no training or guidance from management, despite having a week's worth of 'training' in which we repeatedly cleaned the venue. I've been unhappy with the organisation of the place and suggested solutions. I've also been shocked with how staff have been treated, with two people already getting fired in the first two weeks. Despite these issues, the venue is running smoothly from the outside as all the staff are professional and very experienced. All the guests are happy and we've receiving 5 star reviews everyday.

Last Monday, the GM repeatedly posted complaints about our team on our staff Facebook page - he wasn't working but often watches the cameras and criticises us based on the incomplete picture he sees. I planned to raise this issue with another manager when I next saw them, however for my next three shifts there was no official manager on duty.

On Thursday - our RDO - I received a call from the venue owner saying that I had been dismissed with immediate effect. He said he'd heard I was unhappy and didn't want me there if I didn't appreciate his business. He then asked me to get my boyfriend to call him back as he didn't have his number. My boyfriend then got the same spiel.

To be honest it's a relief that my sunny Easter weekend is now free, but I'm so annoyed that a workplace can treat people in this way with no repercussions. What's worse is that the venue owner had no experience in hospitality before this, and on the launch night he said he felt bad that all of us employees put up with a career path where we often get treated like shit. At this place we've frequently been working for 12 hours, never got scheduled breaks and then have been fired with no notice over the phone. There's definitely a silver lining, but fuck those guys.",0,I've just been fired!,2839

So the other day was a normal 4:30-10PM shift on a Thursday night. It wasn’t insanely busy but there were a lot of parties in the 7’s and 8’s. For some reason, I kept getting the really shitty customers with awful attitudes (or were just complete dunderheads who didn’t listen). I went to take one party of two (it was just one lady who was waiting for her friend) to their booth. The lady then sees the small booth and shouts about how it’s too small and she needs a bigger booth, so I tell her not a problem and to follow me to the front desk.

So I walk back up front and go up to the table filler (we’ll call her Miss Florence) and told her that this party of two wants a bigger booth, when suddenly the man at the front desk barked “Uh excuse me! That’s very rude don’t interrupt while I’m making a reservation!”

I honest to god thought he was joking and the guy looked a little more pissed when I started to smirk a little. Miss Florence and I exchanged looks, and she explained to him that I was just doing my job.

“And I’m trying to make a reservation! I called here yesterday and set up a reservation!” Blah blah.

Miss Florence then told him “You need *not* to talk to the hostesses like that,” then he walked away in a huff, and a younger guy who looked a bit embarrassed who was with him then said, calmly, “I’m sorry, we’re a party of 8.” 

I wasn’t around for this part because I was running around sitting people, picking up menus, etc, but apparently the guy’s wife came up and apologized for her husbands attitude. When Miss Florence told me, I laughed and commented how I’d never marry a guy who I’d have to apologize on his behalf. 

Anyway, we sit them at one of the bigger booths and the guy still kept complaining that the booth is too cramped (even with a chair on the outside), so they go talk to a manager and she’s able to sit them at a bigger table.

I'm a teenage high school student and while I don't rely on my income from being a server to get by, it's still nice to have extra spending money (which I save a lot of it when I can...and thankfully, I have a few thousand banked already).

But back to the topic at hand...

I am like quite a few typical teenagers when it comes to being pierced. I have triple lobes in both ears (my thirds being a fairly recent addition), double helix in both ears, tragus in both ears (one of my newest additions) and my rook in my left ear (another new addition). I have my right nostril, septum (which I keep turned up into my nose to keep it hidden) and my bellybutton which no one sees. By my establishment's dress code (which I do keep good tabs on) I shouldn't have my septum (which is why I keep it turned up) and my bellybutton. But surprisingly, their cool with my little nose stud. I also know of a few other employees that have other piercings and tattoos displayed.

Anyways, during my shift tonight, I get a 8 topper that comes in. I see them and I put a few tables together to make enough room to seat everyone since we're not slammed at this time yet. The host and I get everyone seated. I go through my introductory spiel, handout menus and take drink orders. It was one set of grandparents I'm assuming to be around their late 50's, parents who I'm assuming to be in their mid to late 30's, a teen girl and her friend who I'm assuming to be around my age and two younger kids probably in late elementary school or 6th grade. I get coloring books and crayons for the younger kids while i'm getting drinks situated. One of the teen girls sees the glint of light off of my nose stud and of course being curious, they start asking me questions about it and I answer their questions about my piercing and what it was like getting it, the pain and everything else about it. The one excitingly asks her parents if she can get her's pierced and the mother grumbles a very angry ""no"" at her and gets her to back down asking about getting the piercing any more. I thought to myself ""poor kid. I'd hate to see how she gets spoken to at home."" So, I get the dinner orders off of them and sent to the back and they're talking more about something I'm not sure what. I don't know if they are talking about my nose piercing and how she wanted it or just how her school day went or anything like that. I drop their dinner order when it was ready and went about attending my other tables. I came walking back to their table to see what they wanted for dessert after I had checked everything and kept on top of refills a few different times while they were eating. I got their dessert order so I could put it into the order system when the mom pulled me aside and told me ""you seem like a very nice girl. But, I don't appriciate you giving my daughter and her friend ideas about getting a nose piercing. Asides you would look a hell of a lot better than you do without all that shit in your face."" I had an exasperated look on my face while the mom turned around and walked away. I'm standing there thinking ""what the fuck is your problem?"" So I get their dessert and turn to walk away. The mom says "" This pie seems like it's underdone. Could you get me another piece?"" I smile a forced smile and say ""okay, no problem."" I go and get her another piece of pie from another pie since her piece was the last piece from that particular one and I heard no other complaints about it not being done. She then complained about that piece and said she wanted to talk to the manager. The ironic thing about our FOH manager is she's got body mod's herself. So I said to her about what was up about the situation while we were walking up to the table. The mom started complaining about the pie and how everyone else's meal was terrible (no one ever let on to any trouble which makes me suspicious that they wanted the meal comped) and how I shouldn't be allowed to have piercings because they look ugly. The manager took a look at the plates and saw that the food was totally eaten and I just didn't take the time yet to totally clean everything up yet. So she comped the dessert and took a percentage off of the meal. The mom look at the manager and said to her with as much venom as she could put into her voice ""and what about the little bitch and her piercings?"" pointing at me. The manager looked at her and said ""yeah and the 'bitch' with all the piercings is within the company's dress code so I won't fire her for having a nose piercing.""

479,iLikeHRCashews,0,t3_bf0hy8,15,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bf0hy8/am_i_overreacting/,"Last night at work I had an awful customer experience with a customer. 

It was during a big rush and me, as well as others were very busy. I walk into the back room to grab drinks and notice that there is some food that needed to be taken to Table 53. As im about to set the food down, the Man at Table 53 instantly says, ""No, wrong"". I then ask him what was wrong about it so that I can make it right for them. Before I leave, the Man at Table 53 asks for extra plates.

 No big deal.

 Let me remind you we are still in the busy part of the day and a table had just sat down in my section with my five other tables that need things. So at this point I am taking the food that was wrong back to kitchen and letting them know what needs to be fixed. I talk to the server whose table it is about the wrong food and the extra plates  that they asked for and continued to serve my tables. As I was walking past the Man at Table 53 to get drinks to my tables, not even two minutes after talking to him, he yelled, ""what about the extra plates?!"" I told him, ""just a second, sir."" 


Apparently, this set him off on another level. 

The man started yelling about Me (not his server) not bringing plates immediately after requesting them. Not just yelling at his table, but getting up and demanding to see a manager and pointing and yelling that, ""this man"" wouldnt get me plates. 

But the way my closing manager handled it made me even more mad. 

The way that this man was acting was clearly unacceptable. There is no reason, in a restaurant setting, to get up out of your chair and yell in any situation. Ever. Period. 

My manager talks to me in the back and asks what happens. I tell her exactly what happens and she is also baffled by his behavior. 

I am not sure what she does but whatever she said or did calmed the Man at Table 53 down enough to have him back in his seat. Conflict resolved. Right? 

About five minutes pass and my manager wants me to go and apologize. To the man. The man that cant wait more than two minutes for some extra plates. The man who got out of his chair pointing directly at me, yelling, ""AND, HE DIDNT GET ME PLATES,"" 


Im sorry, but no. I dont think that man deserves an apology from me. The way he acted when I first got to the table was disrespectful. Im not your server, I dont know that this isnt what you ordered because your server rang it in wrong. The way you yelled at me was inappropriate. IM ALSO BUSY AS SHIT. I AM NOT GOING TO SCREW OVER MY TABLES TO MAKE SOME DOUCHEBAG FEEL BETTER. 

And after I told her, ""that man doesnt deserve an apology,"" she then went and said that if she got a manager complaint that she would fire me. 


No. I have no write ups. You can not do that. But you tried to flex your power. And that just bent me the wrong way. This also being the manager that clocks me out before she is done checking my closing work. 

Im sorry but if you want to flex your power and then care about your own reviews before the pride in your workers. I do not want to work for you.

My coworker came in for his shift and he noticed I was upset as I was trying to get the check together for the table so they could get the hell out, he asked me what was wrong and I told him. He said he’d deal with them, and I grabbed my son and left.

I wanted to cry because of how upset I was, not because of me but because of my son. My heart broke that he was exposed to racism at such a young age. I never want him to feel like he’s less than anyone else because of his skin color, or his heritage.

So I do my usual greeting and get cut off by “water with EXTRA ice, now.” She honestly sounds like she’s needs an exorcism due to her raspy voice and snappy tone.

It’s already fun. So I go grab her water and as I set it down for her she is on her phone and waved me off. Great take your time. I have a table right beside her that both have waters and I walk past her to top off their waters. As I’m walking by she waves me off and tells me she’s not ready while still on the phone. I’m not brain dead I know you’re not ready I won’t interrupt your phone call to take your order. Also I’m not dealing with you so chill out.

About 10 minutes after she is initially sat she finally puts her phone away and I’m on my way over. I ask her if she’s ready and she responds “I’m ready to order if that’s alright with you.” Sounds innocent enough if you read it but the sass was incredible.

Not even 30 seconds after I walk away she is snapping at me to get my attention while I am cashing out another table. I finish up with them and return to her. She tells me her soup is cold (there’s visible steam) she wants a new soup that’s warm because soup is supposed to be warm, she smacks the table to emphasize warm.

People will often pick up food from the belt mainly because it’s more fun than ordering. A lot of times we didn’t get any tips since people often thought we got paid hourly and that we didn’t do that much for them (SO WRONG). 

Anyways, what happened that made me speechless was about a lady coming in with her husband and two kids on a Tuesday night. It was a slow week day so I tried to serve all the tables I got pretty nice in order to get good tips. So this family came in, they got sat by a hostess at another server’s section table which was half booth and half chairs, she immediately got angry and told the hostess that “ We drove for 3 hours already. Can we actually get a real table???” I stood near there at the moment and heard her saying that thinking in my head oh man here comes the demon. So they moved to a “ real table “ that is meant to be served for above 6 people in my section. I tried to put on my smiling friendly face, went to their table, greeted them. Nobody answered. Okay. Fine. I moved on to ask them if they wanted to start off with drinks or apps. I’m pretty sure I was clear with everything I said but the wife started looking up( finally) and made a weird face expression with a “ WHAT” to my face. I patiently repeated the question “ would you like anything to drink “ to her even though my blood was raising. She then still made the weird face expression and proceeded to answer “ water” to me without even let her husband and kids speak for themselves. Fine. Went to get water. Dropped it off. Made sure they got what they needed. Said “ enjoy your meal” then left, 7 mins later my manager came to me asking why I didn’t bring a coke to their table. I was like but they NEVER did order that?!!?? Still fine. I got the coke, brought it to their table, asking again if they needed anything else. They said it was fine that they didn’t. Okay cool. 10 mins later, I came up to their table asking if everything was alright. A wife, made an angry face, saying that she hadn’t seen the Shrimp Tempura roll going around on the belt. I told her she could always order things to me since the sushi rolls they put on the belt are random. So sometimes those popular rolls would run out. She then said ok then bring her a FRESHLY MADE Shrimp Tempura Roll. I was like madam all our rolls are fresh. So I put in the order, with the memo of FRESH to the kitchen. 5 mins later, the order was ready. I hurried to get the roll and made sure it was FRESH. The shrimp tempura was still hot. Good. I thought the wife wouldn’t be able to complain about anything anymore. I brought it to her, then she started using her freaking dirty hand to pick and destroyed the beautiful roll. She started examine the roll, became angry ( again), started yelling at me: “ why is the rice so hard on top? Is this old rice? Why is this HAAARRRDDD? “ I was like madam it was just made 3mins ago. She then started giving me the look of wtf and asked me to explain why the rice on top was hard. I then said that the top was filled with tempura flakes, so that’s why it’s hard. She then became ashamed of being stupid so she quietly passed it to her husband and didn’t eat it. Fine. I walked away thinking how people could just assume things to be their ways instead of asking if they didn’t know. Finally they asked for the check, I handed it to the husband since he was reaching out to get the check book from my hand. The wife immediately grabbed it violently from him, insisted on paying. Ok. I ran the card, gave it to them, thanked them ( of course nobody answered again) and walked away. Ok. She gave me $2 on a $70 sth bill. I wasn’t really surprised since she had been a pain the ass the whole time I served her.

She told me the order two times, both times saying mushroom and it was written in my book! How could I possibly confuse artichoke with mushroom in my ears and on my paper.

Do you read wine posts online, eat out a lot or maybe even watch the current Sommelier at your work with guests and think to yourself, ""I could totally be a Sommelier"" but not sure what's involved?

I usually see people apologize for formatting when they're on mobile so I apologize as well. This is also kinda long, but for now let's get into the story!

This happened Saturday (4/13), we had gotten a bit busy that day but everything ultimately had calmed down. And I just had a couple tables to work with.

The host seats this older couple in my section and the man has one of those old man accents, you know? You can't understand him too well at times. I go and greet them with a ""Hi! My name is Crow, welcome to [restaurant]. Would you like to try our dinner special tonight?"" and go into an explanation of the special and the daily side.

The table is a one stop shop and they decide to both get meatloaf. I tell them I'll put that in and get their drinks right out for them. I do exactly that. Order goes in, drinks go right out. I ask them if they need anything and they're fine.

I get seated with another table about 5-10 minutes later and I tend to them. While I'm in the back getting drinks, our chef on the line, who is still pretty new bless his heart, tells me we don't have the meatloaf for this order. I stop making the drinks for the other table, grab a menu, and go back to the older couple. 

""I'm very sorry to let you know that I have just been informed we are out of meatloaf. I brought a menu out for you so you can choose a replacement entree, my apologies.""

With this I get another one stop shop with them and I write down the replacement entrees and give them to the chef. The sides are the same and it is just the entrees that are different. The old man orders some roast beef. (This is important)

I go back to making the other table's drinks and carry out a refill for the older couple after making sure they were alright, then get the other table's order one their drinks are down. I put the table order in. 

After I'd say about 3-5 minutes my manager talks to me and tells me ""hey can you put that replacement order into the system for me just so I can make sure we got it right?"" I tell him sure and I put it in for him. Their food comes up in a couple of minutes after that confirmation.

Now, I don't know if our window is broken or something but our trays that we carry food with have been so so so hot recently. I use my server book under the tray to be able to carry it and steady it with my other hand, trying extremely hard not to touch it for too long as to not completely burn my finger tips.

 Sadly as I'm carrying this tray, theres a huge amount of gravy on the roast beef and it drips off the plate, which is at the edge of the tray closest to me and burns me on the arm. I try my best not to recoil and drop the entire tray and am at the table. I very politely ask if they could take the plate of roast beef so I don't drop everything (I have never had a customer get mad at me for that, especially because they can easily figure out that these trays are extremely heavy with all the china on them.) it takes the old man a minute and he finally grabs the plate and then I quickly give the old lady her food. I ask them if everything is alright, to which they tell me it is. I then leave them be to eat.

A few minutes later my manager is doing rounds in the dining rooms to make sure everyone is doing alright and I go out to check then older couple. I see  them talking to my manager and as I'm walking up I hear a ""what's the problem"" and the exchange goes like this:

Manager: What seems to be the problem sir?

Man, in his old man accent: The service here is awful.

Manager, thinking he said Server: I'm sorry about that the server will be replaced.

Man, glances at me: No no! Crow is fine the SERVICE is AWFUL. We wait twenty minutes to be told you're out of meatloaf, and then wait 30 minutes to get this mess! We've been here for over an hour and it's been awful! My green beans are oily, there's so much gravy on the plate!

Manager: I am so sorry to hear about that sir, I agree that there is an awful lot of gravy on that plate, allow me to fix it right away for you.

And with that he takes the plate from the man and goes into the back to make him an entirely new plate. I ask them if everything is alright other than that and they just shrug and say yes. I check my other table and they're fine as well, so I go back into the back.

A minute after I get back there the other table's food comes up and I take it out to them. Everything is fine with them and I'm heading back to the kitchen when the old man from the other table suddenly yells a ""HEY!"" so loud you can hear him in the back and probably in the front of the store.

I jump and hold the large tray in front of me defensively and to hide myself, due to events in the past I get very scared when a man yells at me. The older man then just starts to go off on me

Man: Give me my ticket now! I don't care! I want to leave! He takes the food and doesn't bother coming back! Give me the ticket!!

Me, stuttering a bit: Y-yes sir, just let me print out your ticket and I'll be right back I promise! I promise!

I quickly rush into the back and one of my good friends A asks me what happened. I tell her the customer is LIVID and she quickly radios my manager, who was making the plate. I print out the ticket and my manager rushes out of the back, new food in hand and stops the man as he's going to walk into the front of the building. A is standing by the doorway into the back and I stand next to her, watching this play out. I don't hear the first  part but I slowly and anxiously go up to the man and give him his ticket and slowly back away. I hear the man say he doesn't want the new food he just wants to leave, so my manager insists he pay the man's ticket because he didn't enjoy his time here. The man gives my manager the ticket and then walks out.

My manager then rushes into the back again, puts the new plate in the bus cart, grabs a to go bread bag, goes to prep, and gets two muffins. He then goes and CHASES this couple down in the parking lot to give them these free muffins. Different servers were asking me like what had happened and if i was okay because I was still kind of shaken up. I go and clean off the table they left and I notice a five dollar tip on the table. When my manager comes back he talks to me about the situation and tells me that a table that wasn't even in my section felt so bad for me that they put the tip on my table before they left.

One of my coworkers who was off the clock N came in with her dad J (hes a regular). I tell N the story while she's in the back, talking to everyone and she then relays the story back to J. While I'm out in the dining room cleaning another table J strikes up a convo with me.

J: Hi Crow! How are you?

Me: doing the best I can, J. How are you?

J: I'm doing fine myself! I heard you had a doozy.

Me: oh yeah it got pretty busy today.

J: No, no, a doozy.

Me: ooooh N told you. Haha yeah Manager chased them down in the parking lot to give them free muffins.

J, laughing a bit: ah, if only Manager treated his wait staff like he treated some customers.

Me, suppressing a laugh: pfff yeah you're right J. It was nice talking to you.

I leave and go back into the back and that was that. My manager did try to get as many details as he could from me to try and figure out what could have been done better. I did end the night off on a good note with a nice table that talked to me about my college major (biology, I also love Ornithology which is the study of birds) and they listened to some of my bird facts and told me about some of their experiences with birds they've had.

We're open for lunch and there's a man that comes in and sits by himself and orders the same thing once or twice a week, leaves a $2.60 tip, and leaves. He wears glasses and has this scraggly mullet kind of thing going on and stares a lot, so he always seemed off-putting but nothing ever happened. Until..

One day he comes in and is served by a male (let's say Ben). He asks if a certain female server (let's say Hannah) is working and she is, but she's in a different section. He has a cut out of a crossword puzzle in his hand and we figured he brought it to work on and paid no mind to it. He finishes his meal and asks Doug if he can give the crossword puzzle to Hannah. Doug agrees and the man leaves.

Hannah receives the crossword puzzle and when she opens it up her mouth drops and she stands stock still staring at it in disbelief for what seemed like a full minute. She hands Doug the paper back, he sees a completely blank crossword puzzle from some newspaper except for one answer filled in:

All of a sudden I'm sat a table of 4 boys, all looking to be 18-24 (one of which I know was 24 because he showed me his ID). Right off the bat, I already feel weird about this table, they reeked of pot and were constantly talking in a hushed tone and bursting out laughing, and I'm not one to judge, but they looked.... just like they couldn't afford what they were about to order - which I'm about to get to.

I get their drinks and one of the guys orders beer, whatever. I ask if they're ready and they start ordering. One orders a sirloin with regular sides and a salad, another orders the same thing (one of these sirloin meals is about $17 each. So far I'm thinking ""okay this is pretty normal.."" then i move on to the next guy and he gets a NY strip and some upgraded sides and another beer, hes about $37 deep just by himself, which is still okay. This last guys order though , pretty much gave it away that they probably weren't going to hang around to pay for it. THIS LAST GUY orders a NY strip + rock lobster, 1lb of crab legs, 2 orders of shrimp scampi, and all upgraded sides. $70 worth of food just to himself! I start telling servers around me to keep an eye on this table, and if they start to leave to come get me immediately. 

The food comes out and they're eating, still acting really sketchy. You know when someone's talking about you and then you get closer and they all just stop talking ?? That's what was happening when I'd come around the table. And when I'd walk away, they would laugh really loud.. Anyway, I was out getting drinks at the bar, and my friend/coworker comes looking for me and tells me that one of them is leaving. I hurry the fuck up w what I'm doing and go back to the table, and sure enough TWO of them at this point are gone. I look around and I see that one of them is out smoking a cigarette, but I decide I need to drop the check off and get boxes now. I tell my friend that she needs to grab our manager and make sure these guys don't leave without paying. Unfortunately my manager is not a very smooth person, she came over to the table and made it absolutely and painfully obvious that she thinks they're going to walk out. One of the guys even says ""why you think we're going to leave?"" When she asks  ""Are you all on one check? Getting ready to pay??"" LIKE WTF???? My face instantly got red, and apparently when I went to grab something for another table she stayed in the room and stared straight at them.. 

I come back a few minutes later and ask if they're ready for me yet, and the guy who ordered 3 entrees to himself says ""not quite yet"" the other two guys come back from wherever they went and the guy that ordered the beers and NY strip is sitting there ripping up coasters, napkins, etc. One of the guys asks ""dude what are you doing and he replies"" ""I'm making a mess hahahahahah!!"" He then looks up at me and asks ""you thought we were gonna leave you??"" I obviously said no, and he goes ""yeah you did."" I leave the table and my friend tells me they are gone, but I knew my manager was up front waiting for them. She comes back to the kitchen with the book, and tells me that they were definitely going to leave with the book and everything if she wasn't standing there. I got $5 on 200 and that's just because they didn't wanna wait for me to grab their change. 

Also, they left me a huge mess on purpose, I'm talking biscuits stomped on the ground, ripped napkins, paper, coasters, salad dumped on the floor, etc. I hope they know it's the poor busser who has to clean that shit up. I felt pretty bad so I stayed and helped him clean it all up but seriously?? Y'all are GROWN ass men acting like 12 year olds, the guy who ripped up all the shit was 24!!!!!

I’ve been in the industry for about ten years, the last four I’ve spent bartending and over the last few months I’ve stepped into serving as bartending hours were tough to keep up with while being in school. As a bartender I’ve had my fair share of unreasonable people and thankfully due to where I worked in the past the staff had a lot of freedom to put those people in their rightful places. 

Well, ten months ago I moved cities and got a job at a decently nice Mexican restaurant. We aren’t fine dining but definitely a few steps above typical corporate franchise “cheap” restaurants. To put it in perspective we are a Mexican place that charges for chips and salsa and house margaritas run $9. 

Our clientele is largely business people as we are located in a huge corporate park but we do get families and couples on dates regularly. People are generally great and I love the job, the management rocks, and the staff is the friendliest I’ve ever worked with in a restaurant. 

Now on to the story;
Last night I was on the floor, and it also happened to be my eleventh day straight of working because college is expensive. I got my second table fairly early in the night, about 5:30 or so. They were a married couple in their late fifties/early sixties I would say. I Greet them, they were extremely friendly, asked a few questions about the menu and ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees all in one round-GREAT as it streamlines the service for both of us. 

I bring them their drinks, a Malbec and dewars on the rocks and the complaints begin; our ice is shitty. Why do we use ice chips? They melt too fast and will ruin his scotch, why didn’t I say anything?? I’ve never had someone yell at me over ice before but I just apologized and brought him a glass packed with ice on the side to replenish the shitty ice that melts. 

As I drop their app the woman tells me to “slow down with the rest of it.” Which is fine, no one wants their meal right after they get their app. I should point out that their appetizer was one ear of corn that they were splitting so nothing that would take long to eat but I decided to wait about ten minutes before firing their entrees. The food comes up, I run it and collect their dirty app plates, after checking if they need anything-extra napkins, hot sauce, and two plates because they want to share, I turn to my other table who is winding down to ask about desserts/checks when the woman loudly yells at me that they need their extra plates “sooner rather than later so they can start eating”.  I take a whole of MAYBE 60 seconds to run to the back, throw the dirty app plates in dish, print my other tables check, grab a bottle of hot sauce and a handful of napkins and as I’m walking back to the table the woman is turned around in her chair with her hand over her eyes like she’s scanning the god damn horizon for enemy vessels. I drop everything off and inquire about the food. She does the “so-so” motion with her hands and says her tortillas are cold-okay I will get you fresh ones, anything else?? Nope. 

Return with the tortillas and now she says her rice is cold. I apologize again and tell her I would be happy to replace the entire dish, she says no, that she just expected more and this is where my 11 day streak kicks in. With my sweetest smile I apologize for the food quality and ensure her I would never bring cold food to a table and how sorry I am that I have no way of confirming temperature before it gets to them. She rolls her eyes and tells me to remove her husbands plate-fried catfish tacos, because they’re “too fried”. 

Now at my job the management and the chefs genuinely appreciate complaints and comments because we constantly want to improve. So I ask her what “too fried” means, she huffs and rolls her eyes and jabs a finger at the plate saying there’s too much breading (there wasn’t) and to just get it away from her. At this point I know the table is sunk and I’m not making money so I ask if she wants to speak with a manager. She refuses so I say “I’m so sorry you’re so unhappy with all of your food. Are you sure you don’t want to speak with the manager? We really appreciate feedback and we can’t improve if we don’t know what is wrong”. She agrees to talk with my manager then. 

At this point I want to point out she is still eating her “cold rice and tortillas”

So the manager comes over and this woman goes on a 15 minute tirade about how horrible I am, how I need a completely new attitude, I shouldn’t be serving, I shouldn’t have more respect for my tables and own up to my mistakes(????). All while I’m serving four tables around her and two on the patio because I am a damn good server which my management is highly aware of. 

At the end of it all, they got a completely comped meal, aside from their alcohol, and another ~15 minutes bitching to my manager that somehow turned to a conversation about Trump?? 

Afterwards my manager told me the woman clearly needed to be coddled and ass kissed to be happy which 9/10 I will do but 11 days straight on the job combined with issues out of my control (food temperature and ice?? I wasn’t willing to do it) plus I kept my best customer service smile and voice on the entire time so sometimes you just can’t win. 

Oh and the icing on the cake was an extremely long and detailed note on the check, zero tip of course, about how unpleasant, rude, and combative I was. How I ruined their evening and was clearly  “not born to serve” 


I have never had a single complaint on my service, my attitude, my efficiency, or the ice I serve to people before. Thankfully management has my back and is aware that this woman was just looking for someone to bring down to her level of misery.

Bear with me. This is true. This bar is still open. And these things happened all the time because of the non-existent standards. 

I worked (recently quit) at a local dive bar in a college town with pretty sketchy regulars. I’m talking we regularly found needles and crack pipes in the bathrooms kind of stuff.

Anyways, I’m working my late night shift and we are dead slow. There are maybe 6-10 customers in the building. 

These two guys call me over to the bar. Normally, I would have gotten the bartender, but the one on shift wasn’t very attentive and often left the customers on their own. 

I go over to the men and man #1 immediately starts begging me to fuck man #2. Highly uncomfortable, I decline. I start to leave and man #1 wraps his arm around my neck and squeezes—hard. 


At this point the bartender and I have made and are holding eye contact. She lights a cigarette and turns her back to the scene. 

I start telling the man in the best “I want to kill you but don’t want to lose my job” voice that if he doesn’t let go I’ll call the cops or be forced to bar him from the establishment. He proceeds to squeeze harder. 

I elbow man #1 and 2 (for good measure) and wriggle out of the headlock. Obviously, I ran to the back and hid in the kitchen for the duration of my shift and gave the other servers my tables.

Come to find out that the bartender did kick them out—only after they jumped the bar and tried to run off with some jager.

He would let me keep the change plus the $20. they’re only request is that I keep bringing drinks and try not to let the glasses get empty. I served him four rounds last time they visited. 

Right before I left last night the couple came in again. I was so excited to see them because they’re amazing tippers. I stayed and i served them a round, saw they were paying the same way as last time. In my excitement, thanked them for the money (they just smiled as usual; they did not correct me) then waited from the server’s well for them to start drinking. Afterwards, I planned to ask them how they liked the drink. 

But I never got a chance to check on them  because they were more into their date than the drink. They took forever to touch the drink. They were engaged in pda and I didn’t want to bother them. So I ended up leaving as my shift was over.

As a delivery driver, we get paid about $5 an hour plus tips. Managers make much more per hour, and are not allowed to accept tips. If a customer tips on a carry out order, the CSRs (who make minimum wage) working receive it. 

This manager in particular (who I’ll call Allie) is very boastful about “always having our backs.” She goes out of her way to tell us stories of how she’s helped drivers in the past, argued against customers to protect her workers, etc. I’ve not personally seen this, though. She makes the pizzas fine but otherwise spends time playing on her phone, ignoring the oven and customers.

Not sure if this belongs here, but I figured Airline Stewardess was close enough to server. I wasn’t the stewardess in question, just an involved witness.

Tl;dr at the end

This happened a few years ago so dialogue is not going to be 100% correct, but this enraged me so much when it happened I think it’s time to finally share. 

I was on a flight about 3 years ago from Hong Kong to San Francisco, heading back to college after winter break. I had just gotten status aboard my airline and gotten a Premium Economy seat, with extended legroom and better food, and I was feeling good about the flight. 

I am seated in an aisle seat in the central block of seats. My seat is in an exit row with even more extra legroom, with only the bulkhead in front of me. The block of seats to my left is two abreast per row, with the seats for the stewards/stewardesses against the bulkhead facing backwards (these seats are only used for takeoff, landing and turbulence by the staff). 

Boarding begins and we all shuffle in according to boarding groups, airline status...etc. the overhead bins fill up as people take their seats and I settle in after the people in the middle seats of my row are seated and squared away. The row of seats to my left remains conspicuously empty, but baggage fills that overhead compartment too because bags. 

The influx of people coming on to the plane begins to thin as we get nearer to our departure time. Eventually, a middle-aged couple comes to take the unoccupied seats in the row next to me and tries to square away their bags. The overhead compartment above them is full because they were late to their boarding call and can only accommodate the duffel the lady brought. The backpack the man brought has no room, and the guy just places it on the ground at his feet and settles into his seat. 

As the cabin crew come around to do their preflight checks such as checking seatbelts, recliner seats and closing all the overhead bins, a stewardess notices that the man has a loose bag at his feet and tells him that because there is no seat in front of him (just the bulkhead and the crew seats) he must stow his bag in an overhead compartment. This just sets the guy off, and he becomes abusive and rude. 

D = Dickhead Dude
Me = This Dude
S = Nice Stewardess (not a dude)

S: I’m sorry sir, but you’re going to have to put your bag in the overhead bin. Would you like me to find a place for it?

D: there’s no space in the bin above me! Why the fuck are you all so unprepared with this terrible service? No space for my bag where do you expect me to put it?

S: Sir there may be space in another bin. Would you like me to find a space for your bag?

D: this is ridiculous. How can there be no space for my bag near my seat? You are all so fucking stupid! You are stupid! Worthless at your job. 

S: Sir there may be space in another compartment - would you like to find a space put your bag or shall I do it for you? 

D: Yes you do it! I’m sick of doing your work for you, lazy bitch. You are so stupid yes do it for me! You want me to do your job for you? This is outrageous that there is no space in MY overhead compartment. What are you people doing? Where are you going to put my bag dumb bitch? 

At this point I’m getting really angry, and really feel for this poor cabin crew member who was only doing her job. I recall seeing an empty space in a compartment in the row behind me when I closed the overhead bin.

Me: (interrupting D’s rant) Miss, I think there’s space in the compartment back there

I gesture back to where I remember seeing the space. S just smiles at me and takes the bag to stow it. 

The aircraft pulls away from the gate and the engines start to spin up. As we prep for takeoff, the cabin crew need to take their seats. S takes the crew seat directly across from him! At this point I’m crossing my fingers hoping the little dispute has ended. The bag is stowed, we’re about to be in the air, D was going to shut his mouth and watch a movie or something. Not so.

D begins to berate S to her face, and the worst part is that she can’t respond and further piss off a customer, and she’s seated facing him and cannot move until the aircraft reaches cruising altitude. 

D: you are so stupid! You such at your job. You know how I know you are stupid? You work as a steward on an airplane serving me food and drinks. You’re worthless! Are you worthless? Yes you are. 

Meanwhile, I can tell S is on the verge of tears, but she puts on a strong, stony face and says nothing but Yes sir, nodding her head as D went on and on. 

I confess, I wish I had said something to him, but I didn’t. I wish I had said something as simple as “don’t talk to her that way”, but I didn’t. I felt horribly for S but I didn’t say anything in the moment. 

After the plane leveled off, fasten seatbelt sign turned off, I made sure to find S and tell her how sorry I was that she had to deal with such a horrible man. I said he was being a dickhead and he has no right to treat her that way, and that I would say something about it to the ground staff. The sad part was it was clear this wasn’t the first time she had encountered a passenger like this. 

Unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a satisfying or happy ending. However, D did eventually fall asleep and S didn’t have to endure his dickholery when landing. S also seemed to appreciate my words of support, even if they were just words. She snuck me a couple chocolates from first class after our in-flight meal. 

S, wherever you are, I hope you never have to deal with a passenger like that ever again.

D, I hope you have a fucking heart attack.

As normal, Saturday was rocking. Even though we just opened our patio (yay... ugh) we still had a busy-getting-closer-to-slammed restaurant inside as well. My tables were doing fine, so with a little time to kill I went to go food run for a few minutes. As I am dropping off the appetizer to this one particular table, I give them the customary ""Is there anything else you need at the moment?""

""We need someone to take our order"", one of them responds, with a definite hint of simmering attitude behind the words. I paused, worried for a moment that they may have ordered their appetizer at the bar and had been seated afterwards with the bartender sending word back to the kitchen making sure it ended up at the correct table. Maybe their server hadn't seen them yet? So I double check with them before stepping on anyones toes.... ""Oh! Of course, have you been helped by a server yet?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, \[insert name here\] is our server"", he responds, and he points at him. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my smile became forced. He points at my coworker, who is currently standing at another table of probably ten people, very clearly taking their orders. I know this section like the back of my hand, and I know that is literally my coworker's only other table at the moment, as his other two tables are empty. I also know their appetizer came out in a normal time span since our kitchen shows the time for an order the second it's rang in until it walks out. He's not even close to weeded, no way he was ignoring them.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, it looks like he's taking the order of another table at the moment, I'm sure as soon as he is finished he will come right over and take your order as well. Unless of course you would like me to take your order and I can pass it along to him?""

They look pissed. ""No. Don't worry about it""

OK???? So I offered to take your order after you had an attitude and you're just gonna be mad about it? And then instant, beautiful karma as I took two steps away... the guy who had been the mouthpiece for the table spilled his water all over his pants. I gave him a towel to mop up as much as he could but I hope he enjoyed sitting in moist pants the rest of the meal. I made it back to the other end of the restaurant and my section and when I looked back, lo and behold, there is my coworker standing at the table, as I predicted.

&amp;#x200B;

I was desperate for quick money to make rent back in January so I sent out a bunch of jobs apps for serving jobs then mid-january I interviewed at 2 places that both decided to hire me and I took both jobs. One is at a country club, the guests aren't my favorite and it's a 20 minute drive away but 18% gratuity is automatically included though that means that the members don't leave an extra tip besides a dollar or two occasionally so bi-weekly I get a 500-600 deposit. The manager is awesome, she tries to get us the most $ possible so if a shift is slow then she will try to get us to at least $8 - $10/hr. and she works with my schedule that I give the week before so if I need a specific day off then she's understanding. I typically open and work lunch shifts there 4 times a week, sometimes a dinner shift too if im available.

The second job is at a much more casual place that only has 1 or 2 servers work a dinner shift starting at 5 or 6 which I do 3 times a week and some saturdays all day, I do get fairly good tips which come as cash in hand at the end of every shift then the small deposit bi-weekly (having both jobs it worked out that I get a deposit every week). I love the customers especially my regulars,  my coworkers and the vibe of the place but its very stressful bc with two servers on at most, I will work outside alone which is a lot of physical work and having 20 or sometimes more tabs at one time to keep straight, and the main manager is the worst. She knows shes terrible, she gets stressed and takes it out on us, she yells and is just not someone I like to be around, I immediately feel stressed when she is there and i get scared to tell her if ive messed something up which has happened of course. It's been hard training both, learning all the menus, having to know regulars at both places, etc. but the money has been good.

\------------------

Now after 3 months I am at the point where I need money bc I want to move to an expensive city where I can get a job in my field which I wanted to do by august of this year but I spend monday - saturday working, im always exhausted and I dont have time to do things like join groups and work on my brand development for my career job bc most of those groups/classes, etc. are on weeknights. I have one class I take sundays but I dont have a lot of time to prepare for it which sucks. I have struggled to know which job to quit but decided on the second one despite giving up the cash I get every shift. I figured I could pick up two dinner shifts a week at the 1st place to bring in more money and at least have flexibility. I am not confident in quitting bc I need a lot more money to move so that will be impacted but I can save up all i want and move but not have anything set up for my career when I get there so this is the best option.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, im so scared to quit. I feel guilty bc its getting busier there, a bartender and a food runner just finished their last 2 weeks this past weekend and when I went to talk to the scheduling manager about quitting, the mean one was in there too and they were talking to another server about how we can make it with the people we have now even though itd be hard after the other 2 quit so I chickened out. Now I have to go do it tonight because the last day I can work is the 27th due to a trip out of town the next day and I know both managers will be there. I dont know why im so afraid and I dont know what to say to them bc I know they will be scrambling to find someone else and I dont know how they will respond to me as far as asking me why, etc. When I requested a 3 hour block out of an entire week off for my class they had a problem with it bc when they hired me i said i had open availability (mind you i schedule my 1st job around the 2nd one's schedule so I stuck to what I said about availability until the class and one time they scheduled me during that time because they needed everyone to come in so I had to miss a class that I saved up to pay for.

OK so I’m deciding to cross post on tales from the customer because I’m technically the customer in the situation but it happened while I was at work waiting my tables. 

So I work at a wing place, and today a table sat down and I greeted them and got them their drinks. I went ahead and put in their order, and all was fine. Until the woman came up to me while I was at a computer and asked me what my name was. I told her what it was and she asked if I remembered her. I told her I didn’t. She then said OK and sat down. The Way she said it made me think that something was not OK. I ignored it and kept taking care of my other tables. I didn’t come back and she’s standing up looking for me. So I ask her if everything was OK. She said it wasn’t. Here’s the deal.

About a year and a half ago, I went to go get my hair done at a salon. She came highly recommended and I was excited to get my hair done. It ended up looking like trash. From the get go she had an attitude with me because she could tell that I was having a panic attack.I went to the bathroom and threw up twice while I was at the salon. I’m not going to lie I was definitely having a depressive episode at that time. Life is hard for me. She had an attitude with me because I kept panicking and shaking. Then she made everything one color even though the pictures specifically has different highlights throughout the color. I could tell she just wanted to get rid of me. Because I was with my mom at the time, I decided to just pay and leave so I could cry at home. The next day I decided to text her and ask if I could please come in to get my hair redone because I did not like it and through text she was very rude and said that I needed my meds because I was crazy and she didn’t have time for me in the salon. This made me really upset, so I posted her texts on yelp and gave the salon a bad review. I feel bad about having given her a bad review, and I do feel bad about sharing the screenshots. But at the time I was very upset that she had commented on the fact that I needed medication. I was at a point in my life where I was ready to end it all. She definitely did not help. So anyways, she tells me that she was the one who ruined my hair (her exact words) and that she doesn’t want to eat there anymore. I asked if they just wanted another server and they said no because they didn’t know how vindictive I could be. As if I were to spit on their fruit or something which I would never do. All in all I thought it was a funny experience. For one, I didn’t even remember her, which means I must be doing a lot better in life. And also, it gives me pleasure on how I reacted in the situation. I was calm I was still smiling and happy, And I didn’t let it ruin my entire night. A year ago, that would’ve destroyed me.

It was pretty tame for a Sunday.  Two women end up being seated diagonal from us in the booth across the aisle. Usually, in said establishment, it is difficult to hear anyone’s conversation outside of your seating are due to the ambient music/acoustics. Usually. Not this time.  The one woman was having a conversation like her friend was across the grand canyon.

Then she orders a “Hot Iced Tea”.  The waitress repeats it and off they were. I’m thinking to myself ... what the holy hell is a hot iced tea? Is it hot tea or iced tea? If this is a normal/common thing that I don’t know about, I will promptly apologize and delete my reddit out of embarrassment. 

Fast forward a few minutes, she gets an iced tea and sweet Jesus it was like she just got served a glass of piss. She gets all condescending and is like does this look like a hot tea to you? Can I have a hot iced tea please? This poor waitress was probably as confused as I was.  

A few minutes later, she comes back with a hot tea. I figured well, that has to be what she wanted. Nope. Wrong. Flag on the play. She pulls the manager card. Specifically: “I need to see your manager. You can’t seem to get my drink right, and I am losing my faith in you, this establishment, and if my food will come out the way I want it”.  Now its gone from mildly entertaining to moderately annoying.  

Manager comes out cool as a cucumber, woman starts yelling at him. I can’t even repeat what she said because it was all slurred and it was almost like ... a bunch of words strung together without any verbal punctuation.  All I really heard was from the manager: “Well ma’am, what was the drink you ordered?”  

“A.Hot.Iced.Tea” said just like that. Almost a full pause between each word. And almost like she was holing back a river of vengeance over ... some kind of drink.

God bless this manager, not only for making me feel sane for not knowing what a hot iced tea was, but also verbally roundhouse kicking this woman in the mouth. 

He goes “Can you describe to me what you want to drink?”

And she goes ballistic for about 15 seconds about how its soo common and everyone knows, how can he not know, blah blah blah. 

The moment you all been waiting for (if you read this far), a hot iced tea is: regular tea with a cup of ice.

This woman must have thought she was on a reality show, like real housewives of bumfuck nowhere. That whole production was obnoxious and over the top, and wholly unnecessary.

My manager apologizes but reminds him of our no talking policy and mentions he should be familiar with it since he’s a victory member. Apparently people heard him and at least two rows were looking at the hallway door. 

The man gets angrier, starts cursing at us. At this point he’s told to leave and the man tells my manager that his wife and daughter are in the other theater waiting for him. 

My manager tells me to find the manager watching over the theater he’s supposed to be in that theater what happened. We did and they asked if he can wait at the bar for them if they went let him in. Both manager agree. The man is livid. He ends up leaving all together, leaving his poor wife and daughter at the theater by themselves. Both of my managers ended up giving the ladies coupons for their next visit and made sure the found a new ride home. 

The man is no longer welcome at our location, apparently when I was gone he threatened my manager and called me a variety of insults. He only left when my manager started to call the cops.",0,Man breaks my theater’s rules and gets kicked out with no ticket refunds,44

My heart was racing, knees weak, palms sweaty, etc. I've honestly never encountered that much hostility before in a guest interaction, nor have I ever ""mislaid"" a guest's money in 15 years of service industry experience. I'm mild, polite and patient when I'm working, and this entire situation was just bizarre and unnerving.

I was completely covered except my hands, neck, and face. Yet, I was sexually harassed several times today. 
On one occasion I was cleaning a table and I heard a man (60-70age range) speak up and say “those kitties sure look soft can I squeeze them?” I knew he was speaking to me, as I looked up and seen the whole table watching. I just simply said: “be careful; that could be considered as sexual harassment.” The table laughter and went back to their conversation. I kept my composure until I was out of sight and tried to calm myself. 
Later in the night I was asking a man his order and instead of telling me what he wanted to order he leaned back in his chair and smiled. Then he replied: “those cats eyes look so nice, you should let me squeeze them.” I was so disgusted and frustrated so I told him “sir that’s sexual harassment.” And he had THE AUDACITY to tell me “it’s not my fault you chose to wear that shirt.” My mouth dropped. I was honestly shocked at what I had heard. I just told the man, “I’m sorry I won’t get into this with you if I’d like to keep my job.” And asked again what his order was. 

It’s so sad that it’s 2019 and women everywhere still are forced to listen to this Bull Shit. I come home every shift and tell my boyfriend about the things said to me, the wandering eyes, the “Accidental” grab or touch. 
I wanted to ask these men, would you say that to your Sister? Your Daughter? Your mother? Would you say that to any male person? If you’d answered “no,” to any of these questions, you are a super douche. What would you say if you heard someone talk to your wife, daughter, mother, grand daughter like that? Would you sit and laugh, or would you be angry.

Only thing is in the notes, they wrote “4 adults and 4 high chairs” so this was actually 8 people. One of my biggest pet peeves is parents not counting their children as people in their reservations - if they’re taking a space, they count as a person. The wait at that time for anything over 4 people was over an hour, so I called them and asked if they would be okay changing their reservation time. I told them I could take 4 but not 8.
“Oh well they’re really small, we would only need like a six person table”

“Only if we have room, which right now we don’t because we’re pretty overbooked tonight”

554,collins_anonymous,0,t3_bddgbd,5,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bddgbd/how_do_you_work_around_guests_with_language/,"**To provide some background:**

I'm currently a graduating senior from a well-regarded hospitality school in the west coast of the US. Having had multiple internships with large hotel chains before and already landing a food and beverage management trainee position post-grad, I decided to get more experience/make extra cash by becoming a server at an upscale, a la carte Korean BBQ place located near where I live.

The area around where I live has had a massive influx of extremely affluent, young, Chinese nationals who come here to attend higher education, do business, etc. in recent years. This happened a decade or so after there was a first wave of Taiwanese/Vietnamese/etc. immigrants of lower/middle class backgrounds settle in our area. My parents came during this first wave, in fact. Growing up, I was essentially was just forced to be accustomed into American cultures and customs; now at work, I've been finding it rather disturbing that I see myself have feelings of prejudice against this new group of migrants who I and many others feel as if they lack the desire to assimilate into American cultures and customs. 

**With that being said,** 

For example: I've experienced numerous instances where they've snapped their fingers in order to hail me down, shout across the dining hall to ask me to grab things, don't understand the concept of tipping, and laugh at me/make me apologize numerous times over tiny mistakes. Our restaurant concept, where we as servers actually cook the meat for guests right in front of them, also poses complications. Many of our guests seem to be very prideful and take offense when I cook for them, and there's a tendency for them take away my cooking utensils in order for them to cook for themselves.

It also doesn't help that I can speak Mandarin Chinese as a second language to a fairly proficient degree. It's sort of like a double edge sword. If I speak Chinese to the guests, it helps limit miscommunications. However, it often leads to the guests demanding much more out of me as a server, which overall leads to me just being more frustrated/slows down service. On the other hand, if I don't speak Chinese to the guest, it often leads to errors in the order (i.e. wrong dishes ordered even after I had read over them what I was going to punch into the POS), general miscommunication, but they're somewhat less demanding to me. 

When I started working there I was completely enthusiastic about the job. I tried my best to accommodate guests by speaking Chinese as much as I could, and enjoyed all the experiences I've had. 5 months in, I feel as if I've had increasingly bad days caused by such experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

Have I simply become a pathetic, prejudiced, two-faced individual, or is what I'm experiencing relevant to those in somewhat-similar situations as me? Or this just an indication that this type of restaurant/work place isn't just for me?

We have two new hosts that are both barely out of training, so numbers and rotations were completely out of whack, and pre-bussing was non-existent. I ended up with 8-9 tables during the rush, and I'm running around like a mad man trying to keep up with food running, keeping up with drinks, greeting tables and getting orders, bussing as much as I can, etc. 

During all the madness, I accidentally close out a card on the wrong table. The table I was supposed to use the card on was about $35, and I accidentally closed it out on a check that was about $70. The dude is like, ""well when am I going to get a refund back into my account?"" and I'm like, ""I'm sorry sir, but it'll take probably 1-3 business days, I apologise again for the slip up on my part"". This guy then goes, ""well what if I was going food shopping later or something and needed that money in my account?""

Now this dude is trying to make me feel like a piece of shit which isn't going to fly, and I hold back from saying, ""well then you probably shouldn't have your budget so tight and manage your financials better"", but I refrain and say I'll talk to the manager on duty and see if there's anything we can do.

So I work at a casual dine in steakhouse chain and I was seated with an 8 top. No biggie. I've got a couple other tables but everything is going smoothly. The party orders alcohol and water, they came in to celebrate a birthday, Yada yada.

I put in their order and keep their drinks topped off they were a pretty lovely bunch. The man who I'm assuming to be the SO of the birthday girl orders nothing to eat, just wants to drink michelob. Weird but fine. Let's call this guy Douchecanoe.

Food comes out in a timely manner and I even come by to check on them after they are a few bites in to makes sure everything came out okay. All good. 

Some time passes by and I see most of them done eating so I swing by asking if anyone needs to go boxes and one of the woman, let's call her Sasha, tells me

""well I diiiid want a box buuuut then""

She shows me her bowl of pasta and there is a piece of plastic from our Alfredo mix. About an inch and a half across. I immediately go into apologetics and tell them I'll take it back to the kitchen and have a fresh one made. They refuse, and one of the ladies says

""We are going to take pictures of this, it's just horrible!""

I rush back to the kitchen to grab a manager and explain the situation. Manager completely comps Sasha's meal, alcohol included (which we aren't technically supposed to do but we made an exception). Since Sasha was paying for herself we thought that was the end of it. 

Well folks I hope you're still with me because this is where it goes from 0 to 100. 

I am printing the tickets out and Douchecanoe walks all the way across the restaurant to our bar and flags down our manager. He INSISTS that more food be taken off of their ticket...HIS TICKET...the dude who didn't even order food, but his girlfriend and her posse happily chowed down on their food and boxed it up to take home. A $100 ticket completely separate from Sasha's. I guess the secondhand mental anguish he experienced from Sasha's meal was so extreme only free food could help. 

My manager being the sweetheart she is, said she would talk to the owner (who was working the line and cooking) and see what she can do. 

Owner looks over Douchecanoes ticket, scoffs, and allows the appetizer to comped. More than fair I would say. 

Well it's not enough for Douchecanoe, my manager goes back to the table and he's demanding to talk to the owner. 

She begrudgingly leaves the line to talk to the guy and takes out kitchen manager with her (I'm assuming because he's the one who is technically in charge of the kitchen, and the dish with plastic was his responsibility so he should apologize).

So I'm meekly standing around, watching 2 managers and the owner talking to Douchecanoe. They all hurriedly rush back and I'm waiting to hear the verdict so I can get this damn table out of my hair. 

The owner tells the kitchen manager in a cold steely tone 

""Call the cops. That man just threatened you, I took it as a threat."" He agrees and gets on his phone. 

I'm not sure what the threat was, but apparently it was serious enough to warrant calling the police.

The owner tells me to go over and collect the checks and I nervously tell her I will. 

There were 4 checks total, 1 was Sasha's and we comped the whole thing. I got 2 other tickets. And saw Douchecanoe with a wad of cash, which he hastily put away when he saw me approaching. Okay so I'll run the other 3 tickets and hopefully this man gets his shit together and pays me when I come back. 

He doesn't. The cops are on their way and we watch the table to see if Douchecanoe leaves without paying. 


ENDING ENDING ENDING FOR THOSE OF YOU SKIPPED TO THE END:


The whole table gets up and makes their way out the door, RIGHT as the cops are walking in. The kitchen manager and I rush to the table to see if Douchecanoe payed for the meal. He left $40 on a $80 ticket. So no not really. 

Now this last part was told to me by our hostess' who work in the front and saw the cops interaction with Douchecanoe. 

The cops confront Douchecanoe and ask him how dinner was. He immediately became hostile, retorting with something along the lines of 

""It's none of you business, why do you need to know?!""

The argument escalates and they go outside the restaurant. 

Next thing the hostess' see is the guy being cuffed. Sweet justice. Although I wish they would have taken $60-$80 out of his pocket to pay the restaurant and to tip me buuuut not everything can be perfect in this world. 

I bused the table and discovered a whopping $8 tip on a nearly $200 combined ticket. And Sasha left me nothing, just walked away with a free meal. 

So that was my night. Thanks to all who read this story, I needed to vent.

He had me get them each a drink made the same way, with an extra shot. At one point, one of the new-comers even asks for an extra shot in his drink, and when I explain his friend had been having me make *all* of them like that, all he said was ""Oh okay, good!"" The night goes on, they order a few more throughout.

Finally, they ask for their check, I put it down in front of them, come back to three credit cards on the counter. I ask if they'd like it split, but they tell me to simply pick one card and run it, which I did. It clears, I put it down in front of them, ask for a signature and wish them a good and safe night.

561,DoctorStrangeduck,0,t3_bd7hr6,18,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bd7hr6/got_revenge_on_a_dine_n_dasher_and_it_was_glorious/,"A girl, mid-twenties, came in, took a seat at my bar, and ordered a vodka soda. I asked her if she wanted to run a tab, she said no, paid with a card, and wrote in a $2 tip. 

I got the feeling she was on her way to something, and had time to kill first, but then about 40 minutes later, another girl showed up, about the same age, and I started a new check for the two of them. They ordered a few more vodka sodas and some appetizers, and ended up with a bill of $34.17.

After about an hour to an hour and a half, they asked if it would be OK if they went out for a cigarette.

Yeah. I know. I don’t usually allow people to do this unless I have their card, but I occasionally make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, and up until this point, no one has run out on me.

In my experience, dine ‘n’ dashers have a plan from the beginning, and these two seemed like they were here by accident. I got the feeling their plans for the evening had fizzled, and they’d ended up here on the fly. They seemed like two nice, if slightly lost, girls, and I just didn’t get any sketchy vibes from them, so I decided to trust my judgment, especially since it was a slow night and I could check on them easily.

Never again. BIG mistake. About a minute later I went to check on them from the window, and they were already long gone. Evidently they *had* been planning this, and FFS I don’t know why these two are running around stealing from restaurants when they should be on Broadway. They are incredibly talented actresses.

So. What to do, what to do. Well, after the initial feelings of shock and betrayal wore off, I remembered that I still had the receipt from the first vodka soda that the girl who’d arrived first had paid for.

So, I adjusted the tip on that receipt from $2 to $53. I used 34 of those dollars to pay the house what it was owed, and gave the remaining $17 to myself -- a 50% tip, which I felt was appropriate considering the circumstances.

Man, I wish I could’ve been a fly on the wall when the one bitch checked her bank statement. I would have given just about anything to see the look on her stupid fucking face when she realized what I did.

Management is actually nice and probably wouldn’t have tried to make me pay for it. It wasn’t a large check. But it’s the principle of the thing. And I guarantee these two bitches will think twice before they try this stunt again, so I feel that I have made the world a slightly better place for all servers and bartenders.

The best part is, there’s NOTHING she can do about it. She was trying to steal from us. There is no way she can complain about this without outing herself as a thief: “So, my friend and I tried to rob this bartender, but she thwarted us, and she forced me to pay the bill in a way I wasn’t expecting. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!”

Management already likes to fleece the customers every chance they get (they refill the brand-label bottles with cheap swill, so…yeah) and they extend that privilege to us.  We are allowed to add 20% auto-gratuities pretty much with impunity, and to a certain extent we are also allowed to write in tips after the fact. As long as you’re not stealing from the house, you’re good. And I made sure the house got paid.

I stapled the cash receipt from the walk-out check to the card receipt from the vodka soda check, with a note saying, “Walk out, same person,” so the manager would know I hadn’t added an extra $51 to some poor innocent person’s check. He never said anything about it specifically, but when I walked in the next day, he greeted me with a hug for the first time ever. Usually I just get a handshake. I think he’s actually proud of me for this.

In fact, I may just be imagining it, but it seems like all of the longtime employees have been super nice to me since this happened. It almost feels like I passed some sort of initiation and now I’m really one of them.

Most of the time I’m not exactly proud to be working in an establishment where the business model is centered around scamming customers, because some of them are nice and don’t deserve it. It does make me feel slimy when I pour someone Grey Goose that I know is not real Grey Goose, even though I have no say in how the business is run, and I knew nothing about all this stuff when I was hired.

But there are also times, such as these, when I’m glad I work in a place that plays fast-and-loose with the rules. I find it perfectly hilarious that these two bitches walked in thinking they were going to scam us, not realizing that this is a place where *we* scam *you.*

I hope this story brought joy to all of you who have had to suffer the injustice of a dine ‘n’ dash.

For most of the shift it was pretty meh. Then an hour before close I guess some kids volleyball tournament got done and everyone decided they were going to come and eat at our restaurant. So me and my coworker got a party of what was supposed to be 25? Except the guests didn't know how to count the people they had and ended up having extra 7 people. Ok great. Except they told us a different number and the restaurant is full. So we didn't have enough tables. So the extra 7 people decided to sit at the bar. 

The problem is that half of the people at the bar had kids who were sitting at the table. And of course everything is seperate checks. (Cause why not right?) And since we have to be complicated all the adults are at one end and the kids are at the other end. So we have no fucking idea who kid goes with who. 

Also some people brought drinks from the bar etc. So there is that.

Me and my coworker get drink orders and are asked how are we gonna split the bills. Like y'all I just need to get these drinks in right now cause i am stressing out. We get the drinks and hand those out. Refill chips etc. 

Restaurant is still full. At this point so we are running around. We go to get the food order in and that isn't too bad. Everyone gets food whatever. Then one of the girls decides she doesn't like her food and wants something else and suddenly there is another girl who I guess was at the bar at the table who said she didn't get to order her food. Wth? Ok great we fix it get the other food orders in done. 

Refills more etc

Then comes time for the bill. So we go to split and it becomes a clusterfuck. Because we give the kids an individual ticket to so they can combine it with their parents etc. One family failed to tell us she had two kids and not one. And then asked us if we can give her a military discount etc. Ok great. A little girl decided to argue with me that her mom already paid for her virgin pina colada at the bar. Ok great but the bar made two because you asked me for one. (We took it off) Mom came over pitched a fit saying her daughter isn't lying. Ok cool so we just randomly rang another drink in right? 

Checks are given and I go to swipe the cards. Cue a lady coming up to me saying, ""I'm going to pay the family with the military discount tab."" Ma'am....like why. I get it's a nice gesture but you are stessing me out. Checks paid cool. 

The parents are impatient and don't understand why it's taking so long to do everything. Well maybe you should make a fucking reservation. 

So they left around and it's about an hour past close. Nothing is done in the restaurant.

We all didn't end up leaving until after 1am. When our restaurant closes at 11. Because of  this bs. And I had to split it with another server so we didn't make much off of the party and it was just not worth the stress.

I’m not sure if this is something to be proud of or to be a bit upset about, but recently was told I’ll be head hostess on night shift. 

My GM and I had a talk a long time ago before I started that she would make me a server or to-go. I’m a host and I’ve done everything by the book, I even started training after 1 month exp. 

One day I talked to my gm again, and she said I’ll never be hired on for anything else except hosting... I was let down and moved on from it and just rocked with it. I thought “hey may as well be an Indian when there are too many chiefs in this place,” right? 

One of the new girls I was training is going to be a server... yes I nearly cried when I was told by her. I bring home crap tip outs, begged to do serving. Anyways, after training her, doing two doubles in a row to train all the new hosts, another one told me he will be serving soon too! Next day later I see my schedule for the whole week and my hours dropped. 
Then another new person hired, a servers mother; who’s never served before, well now she’s a server now too! Never served a day in her life. 


My stomach dropped, I was pissed, ready to just cry in the bathroom. I kept my cool as much as possible. 


So last night, no server was running their food, I was bussing tables while the new girl was learning rotation and seating people (I told her to because it’s important for her to learn, if she’s going to be a server). I was running food, taking drinks, bussing tables and was yelled at if the new girl messed up rotation. The other host was hiding in the bathroom. I tried to get her out but no luck, then she got on a 30 minute break. 

I ended up nearly crying. I had a heart to heart with her that I can’t do this alone, that I’ll seat people and she busses for at least 30 minutes so I can bring myself together. She said “do not serve you do not deserve to do their job when they are getting paid for doing nothing,”. Bless her heart she did. I was crying about how everyone is getting a server position except me, I bring home little to no money the next day from the night before on a tip out if I do ungodly amounts of work. 


In the name of all that is holy, why would a GM think it’s okay this to me? What should I do? I’ve tried and tried and TRIED. I have done so much, and thought I’ve been proving myself while people can walk in and get a position I’ve begged for, for weeks since I started? 

I wanted to get this off my chest so I feel at least a bit better?

Edit with more details: my GM said 2 hosts will be servers, for sure. And said that I’ll “make bank” like $30 a night by closing? (She thinks I don’t know our servers get 100 a night at least....) I feel like my hard work is being taken for granted.",0,"Aggrevated host, HELP. (Any advice from management?)",17

There’s only me and two other employees and our boss.  It’s super small, it’s counter service, we are in a good area where we get people but it’s never too crazy. I’ve been there about two years and know the ins and outs of everything. We work by ourselves a lot in the evenings during the week which is fine it’s never too much to handle. But the weekends are a bit different. 

On Saturday’s we have two shifts, opening and closing with a 2-3 hour time frame where two employees are there. I usually open since mornings are busier and my coworker who has been there about 2 months closes since it’s easier and less busy. Our food menu is small and is fairly easy and fast to prepare. But it takes longer than getting out coffee drinks. Especially if we get busy. 

So it’s a Saturday morning and it had been pretty busy but I’m working hard and fast and everyone is saying how great the service was for it being only myself and getting things out at a reasonable time. Great! So it’s about 10 minutes before my coworker gets there and a lady comes up and orders 2 hot sandwiches, and 2 kids sandwiches. And they get a latte and a smoothie. Okay great. Gotta get the food started then make the drinks. Shouldn’t take too long but takes longer than I’d like. 

A couple of middle aged ladies and a teenager come to the counter. I immediately tell them I’d be with them in just a minute. No problem. Well my coworker comes in and clocks in and I tell her to jump on making the rest of the food and I’ll make the drinks real quick and then I’ll get the counter. I make the drinks and as I’m putting the lids on. All hell breaks loose. 

Me: M

Crazy lady: CL

Regular Customer: R 

CL: UM!!! CAN WE JUST GET A COFFEE????

M: yes! I’ll be with you in one second (I was just about to walk up to the counter)

CL: WE JUST WANT COFFEE!!! YOU TWO NEED TO WORK BETTER TOGETHER TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS HOW YOU TWO ARE WASTING TIME!

Now I’ve worked in food service for years. I’ve been a manager before at a place. I know how to handle a situation like this. I usually keep my temper under control despite rude ass people. 

M: *walks up to counter* sorry for the wait, what can I do for you?

CL: WELL ALL OF US WERE GOING TO GET LATTES BUT WE DONT HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT TEN MINUTES FOR THEM I JUST WANT A COFFEE 

M: um okay, what size?

CL: I CANT BELIEVE YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO PRIORITIZE YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!!

Now I’m getting mad. I told her it would be a little wait and she didn’t wait but 5 minutes at most which yes is a lot but it’s not like I was standing around talking. I was hella busy. 

M: what size coffee? 

CL: IDK!!! JUST A SMALL ONE!

M: okay 2.25 

CL: WELL MY DAUGHTER WANTS SOMETHING!!!!

Takes the drink menu and looks at it for a good amount of time. Funny. I thought they were in a hurry? 

CL: ICED TEA!!! MEDIUM! 

M: okay 4.25 is your total

She proceeds to throw a 20 at me so I slammed her change on the counter. Give her the drinks and I’m like okay whatever. I’m starting to shake I’m so angry because I’m just trying my hardest??? I get through the other customers in line with people telling me I was doing fine and to just ignore that crazy woman and I overhear an exchange between a regular customer of mine and this awful awful woman. 

R: I’m just going to say that they are working really hard and there’s only two of them doing everything, they always try to be as fast as they can to get things out. 

CL: (who has stopped yelling at this point) well this is still ridiculous! I worked in the service industry and this is so poorly run, they need to step it up because no one should have to wait to order. I’m in a hurry, I can’t wait all day!

Lol wut? If this lady was in such a hurry why is she still here?

They exchange a few more words but I couldn’t hear. But luckily this lady who was in such a time crunch finally leaves. My regular comes up and tells me what the lady said and how she couldn’t believe she had witnessed someone being so rude for pretty much no reason. I thanked her for defending us because not a lot of people would do that.

I work for a resturant/game room join that also does birthday parties. There are about three people in the game room section that can book parties, and another two in the resturant that can do the same. We use a standard form and Google calendar to keep everything together, and from prevent most of the chaos that would happen from so many people handling one thing. However there is one down side, the people working that day may not even meet the family/party till that day. We never really felt the need to check id's, cause why? 

So day comes and I'm working as party coordinator (fancy term for keeping kids playing games) and have a kitchen server with me. (it's about 50ish people). The party arrives on time (which is super rare) and we get everything started. The, ten minutes later... The actual party arrives.

You see, the person who booked the party has a sister... That is insane. From what I would later learn the insane sister has, had and will do anything to ruin their life and the life of their kid. As you can imagine, the two sisters get into a bit of a tiffy, and the police had to be called.

For more than a year, I served every day at a local restaurant. During my time there, I had a lot of regulars, but one of my favorites was this adorable lil old couple that would come in once or twice a week.

They always ordered the same thing, always shared a drink while they giggled like high schoolers and were always so sweet to me. It was obvious that they were in love, even in their old age.

We ended up getting pretty close during my time waitressing. I knew about their life, their marriage, their family, their hardships.. they knew the same about me. Before leaving lunch every day, they would say “okay sweetie, we’ll see you next week. Love you!” And I’d shout “I love you too!” And they’d head out.

The husband loved to joke with me, he had a child’s heart. The wife is a doll. One of the most precious people I know.

I recently switched shifts and took on a second job, so I haven’t seen them in a few months. I’ve missed them dearly. They’ve asked about me, but unfortunately we haven’t crossed paths.

That is, until today.

Today she came in, alone with just her daughter. She ordered something different and I raised an eyebrow.

I wasn’t their server, so I didn’t approach them out of respect for the girl who was serving and instead waited for them to say something to me (if they chose to, which they did). As soon as she saw me, she called me over and gave me a big hug.

Then she told me that she had something important to tell me and I glanced across the table. There was an empty seat.

She told me that her husband had passed just last week. He had a long history of health problems and was in pretty rough shape, I knew; but I still never expected to hear her say that.

We both teared up as she hugged me three times over and told me all about everything. She asked about my life, my new job and we exchanged some contact info to keep in touch. She told me that she loves me and that he did too and that I touched them both dearly. She said that this was his favorite place to come be with her, and that she was going to keep coming for him. She wants to feel him with her.

She thanked me for making them both so happy and always being “like sunshine”.

I held it together for their sake, but now I’ve left work and I’ve started crying. Maybe I didn’t know this man, but I did. I knew his personality. I know how much his wife and kids adored him and how beautiful he was to be around. He was an old jokester even in his last days and he loved making others smile. He was a kind heart, a kind soul and so is she. They both deserve all of the beauty that this world has to offer.

I know that this is sad, believe me, but I want it to serve as a reminder that you do make a difference in peoples lives even if you aren’t a “serious” part of them. Those people were like family to me for a few days a week, and I will always love them for that.

A man comes in with his daughter and asks for a bay, and my fellow associate at the counter is helping them. He asks for a bay to play for a couple of hours and my associate looks at our bay control to see if we have any open, then sees we have 1 on the first floor. She says “I think we may have one open for you, let me try seating it”

Turns out the bay was not being sat automatically by the system for some reason. There was a guest on the waitlist queued for that bay specifically, which may have caused the “block” in seating, but after refreshing the bay it was sat for the next guest on the waitlist. Meaning, the new guest had to be placed on the waitlist. No worry, it’s only 4 people waiting and he can be sat within 10 minutes.

My associate informs him that the bay is no longer available and he will have to be placed on the waitlist, but it will be no longer than 10 minutes. At this point, the guest becomes visibly upset and starts arguing with my coworker why the bay is no longer available and why he would have to wait. She tries to explain that there was an error in the system preventing the table that appeared to be available from being sat, but once fixed it was assigned to the next person on the waitlist. He said that our system needed to be fixed and so did the situation. 

I guess he was done with my coworker because he asked to speak to a manager. So my manager that was in the lobby came to the front desk. The man says that he was PROMISED a bay to be sat immediately and refused to wait. My manager explains the system had an error, but we had just gotten off a TWO HOUR wait but we could seat him within 10 minutes. Again, he demanded to be seated. My manager said again, every bay in the venue is seated so it is physically impossible to get you seated right now. Which was true. The guest seemed pretty determined to get a bay immediately but was just making a fool out of himself and embarrassing his child. My manager puts him at the top of the waitlist. 

If this wasn’t bad enough, he had an international phone number so we were not able to contact him when the bay was ready, so I personally had to walk around our three story venue until I found him. It took about 2 minutes. He was standing at the bar when I informed him his bay number and asked him to close out his checks to be seated. He dismissed me and told me “go tell my wife and kids over there” as he vaguely pointed in a direction. Once I pieced together which family I was pointing to, I informed the mother that the bay was ready, and that they are welcome to walk to the bay to be seated. She said she wanted to wait for her husband at the bar, so I stood there for a minute. Our very busy bartender (who was bar tending solo because our managers moved the second bartender to the third floor bar for some unknown reason) was obviously working on some drinks. The man then walked away from the bar, approached me and asked me in Spanish “how long does it take to print out a damn check?” I walked to the bar and asked our lovely bartender to print out the check for me and I could take care of it for him. 

The man then paid for his one drink, which took longer to get than he was waiting for his bay. Turns out he was upset because he wanted to sit at the bar with his family but when our bartender informed him children could not sit at the bar he asked to speak to a manager AGAIN. It was obviously a waste of time. In the end, I walked him to his bay and signed him in personally, and when I asked how much gametime he would like, he informed me he had to pick someone up at 12:00. It was already 11:20.

It wasn't even my table I was just running food. It was a 5 top of teenagers all in prom gear. I drop this dish off to the person who claimed it was his. It was a meatball skillet, which is out grits topped with meatballs red tomato sauce and some gouey ass cheese. The thing is delicious. This kid takes one look at it and I can see there is a problem. So like the good server I ask him:

""Is everything okay?""

""Does this have cheese?""

""Uh yes it does."" (Very obviously so I might add)

""Oh I'm allergic to cheese..."" 

""Uh... okay... Well obviously you can't eat this... did you tell your server you had an allergy?""

""No, I didn't think it came with cheese""

""Okay let me go get your server.""

So let me just say this. This item, like all others, is described very well on our menu. Grits red tomato sauce meatballs and CHEESE. Not to mention our grits are made with cheese so no server in their right mind would ever allow a customer to order this if they had known of an allergy. 

I find the server and of course, she's irritated because we're swamped and this could have all been avoided with a little communication, which if anything these past few weeks have taught me is that teenagers lack the skill to communicate. Even if he had caught the cheese on top and asked for it without the grits would have made him VERY SICK.

I had this server who worked for me at a restaurant in Austin years ago. Don was the nicest, sweetest, most generous soul I’ve ever encountered. He was an amazing server; a customer favorite who never made a mistake. Don was also high *all the time.* As far as I was concerned, that was fine as long as nobody ever mentioned it so I had plausible deniability. 

One day, Don was running late. Now the guy may have been a stoner, but he was *not* irresponsible about work, ever. So he called and let me know he was on his way, ran all the way from his house to work, and showed up shortly before we opened. He set up his station and helped a few customers, but something was seriously off. He wasn’t cheery, he forgot simple things, he was not on his game. I pulled him aside for a minute and asked him what was going on. Was he still upset about being late or was it something else? He gave me a meaningful look and just said, “I didn’t get to do my whole morning routine, you know?” That’s when it clicked; despite working with him for six months I’d never seen Don sober. 

I asked him, “Do you think it would help if you go up to the parking lot for a few minutes before we get busy? You know, to get your head right?”

“The parking lot?”

“Yeah Don. Go finish your morning routine up there before we get busy. I need you today, and you aren’t *you* right now at all.”

“You know what I’m gonna do up there, right?”

“Yeah man, and as long as you don’t say it I can still pretend I’m not telling you to go get high on the clock. You cool with that?”

I've been trained in CPR, but I've never had to do it, until today.

Let me tell you, the sound of ribs cracking is not a nice sound.  During the time between it started, and the time the ambulance came, we had to initiate CPR twice. In the brakes, I had to push back patrons that was in the way, and help the EMS find the place by guiding them by phone. 

According to the EMS, we most probably saved his life.

I work at a lake/country club, which means that about 75% of the patrons are entitled assholes on a regular basis.  I have been serving/bar tending for about 10 years, so whatever, I can deal with that.  There is one member, let’s call him “EA” (entitled asshole) who regularly ruins everyone’s night.  The members are sent a calendar every month, so they know what time the kitchen closes, etc.  EA often shows up 3 minutes before the kitchen closes, and says “I need to order food, I know I have 3 minutes left.” Then proceeds to modify the hell out of whatever he orders, ask for extra everything, and then complains about it when he gets around to eating it.  Usually because he’s walking around talking to anyone and everyone else in the building at the moment (the kitchen closes well before the bar does, so there’s usually some other guests still hanging out drinking).  OF COURSE YOUR FOOT IS COLD, It’s been sitting on the bar for 30 minutes while you were bothering other guests.  So no ones ever happy when they see him come in.

Today he crossed the line.  Even though I bartend, when the dining room is busy, I help out and take a few tables here and there.  One of the tables I had tonight are my regulars, and are very sweet people.  EA was “saying hi” to them, and they’re too polite to not chat with him if he comes over.

I went to ask if the woman at my table needed another glass of wine, when EA “playfully shoved” me.  In a calm voice, almost sarcastically, I said “don’t shove me.” He thought he was being cute, and reached out and poked my arm with a single finger.  I said “really, don’t shove me.  You won’t like how I shove back.”

Fast forward an hour later, EA’s sitting at the bar with his GF, whom he has ignored all night btw.  I am in the process of splitting the cash tips we earned between all the bartenders.  EA ACTUALLY REACHES OVER AND PUTS HIS HAND ON THE PILE OF MONEY.  I did raise my voice this time, and told him never to touch my money.  He responds with “Well it’s not just yours, is it, it’s J’s (other bartenders) money too.”  

So I said don’t touch any bartenders money ever, his GF told him to stop, and I walked away before I actually lost it.

Moral of the story is, don’t ever touch your server/bartender, or their money, for any reason ever.  It’s not funny, we don’t think it’s a joke, just don’t.  Seriously contemplated using a corkscrew to pull EAs eyeball out through his ear, that’s how mad I was.",0,Don’t fucking touch your server,26

We both no longer work there due to a semi hostile working environment and being underpaid, but it was always fun on shift and our co-workers were awesome. My boyfriend occasionally covers shifts for people in emergencies, despite no longer working there. This is a story he told me from a couple of weeks ago.

B: boyfriend
AG: Angry guy

So, B was tending the bar towards the end of the night, it was probably around the time last drinks were called. AG comes up to the bar.

AG: Hey mate, I went out into the back smoker’s and someone knocked me and I spilled all my drink.
B: Oh man, that sucks. It’ll be $8 for another beer.

AG gets angry at hearing this.

AG: Nah, nah, nah, nah. That’s not okay man.

B: Sorry, unfortunately that’s just the policy here. 

AG: Nah, nah, nah. What are we going to do about this, mate?

AG is getting more frustrated.

B: if I had seen you spill the drink in here, I might be able to help you. But unfortunately in this circumstance I can’t. The bars closing up, its $8 for another beer, mate.

AG doesn’t take this offer and gets more angry and loud. Shortly, the security guard for the venue comes in and forcibly removes the guy. 
He starts threatening my boyfriend, and is yelling at the guard. As they are cleaning up the venue to close, AG is staring at B through the front window.

The police are called, and they talk to all parties, but nothing happens. AG storms off and loiters up the road a bit, still in view. The police hang around for a bit, just observing, when they get a call over their police radio and they speed off urgently.

Around 10 minutes later they return. They ask B and security where AG was, and then they run up the street and arrest him.
It turned out that AG had called the police and said there was an armed robbery a couple of suburbs over! When the police got there and there was obviously nothing happening, they connected the dots.

B came home and told me what happened. He said that he was considering calling me to pick him up when he had finished work, because he had parked his car at the front of the venue and would’ve had to walk past AG. He was really worried that AG was going to try and hurt him, and he was so happy that he got arrested.

Last month, I began to work as a host at a restaurant and I regret it everyday. Unfortunately, I wasn’t trained properly so I mess up the to go orders sometimes. This has caused me to receive a lot of backlash from customers and my manager who I am honestly afraid of.

She reprimands me in front of customers which is humiliating. She is also quick to throw me under the bus whenever a customer complain to her. For example, a customer complained about waiting a long time to be seated. My manager asked the customer , “Did the host tell you the wait time was 20 minutes?”.  I actually told the customer it was 5 or 10 minutes because that’s what she told me to say. She NEVER told me the wait time was 20 minutes. Since then, I’ve been afraid of customers lashing out at me due to her blaming things on me to save herself. 

I am constantly left alone to take down names, place to go orders, check customers out. etc. This causes me to feel overwhelmed and make mistakes which my manager gets upset about. She also rushes a lot which causes a bunch of confusion between me, her and the customers. 

To make matters worse, I work 9 hour shifts and hardly get a break. If I do take a break, it’s 10 or 15 minutes which barely gives me time to eat. I’ve had people tell me that I’m entitled to a break but I’m afraid to ask my manger for one sometimes. As stated before, she scares me so I’m afraid of how she will react. I could go on about her but I’ll stop right here. 

Currently, I am looking for a new job.  I try to tell myself that manager treats all the employees like crap so it’s not like she’s targeting me. But the treatment is truly unbearable.

585,Favre2sharpe,0,t3_bcxwlu,12,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bcxwlu/servers_what_are_some_of_the_longest_shifts_youve/,"Hello fellow servers, we've got a 2 parter here, both are related to serving shift lengths. Firstly, what are some of the longer shifts you've regularly been scheduled in restaurants to work? What are some of the more exhausting ones(combining both length, and intensity). What are some of the longer ones you've heard of? What are your thoughts on said shift(s)? I am referring to SINGLE SHIFT lengths, NOT DOUBLES, and shifts that are recurring, rather than a special event or specific instance. I'm trying to gauge the length and intensity of my current shifts, and get an idea as to whether or not these shifts are off the charts abnormal, or possibly par for the course.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, and more importantly, I'd appreciate opinions on my current scheduled shift lengths, and the length of what my new manager has proposed, for the restaurant I am employed. I currently work at a fast paced, mid-priced brunch restaurant located downtown. My current scheduled shift has me working from 8:00am, until 5:00pm. We are a relatively popular restaurant, and are essentially packed from 8:30am(we open at 7), until 4pm(the time we close), for Saturday and Sunday brunch. That being said, and given the size of a server's section, I am more or less hauling ass, non stop for the entirety of that time. These are hands down, the most exhausting shifts I've ever worked in a restaurant, since the start of my industry employment some 10 years ago. We don't get breaks(which is a given in this industry), my 1 minute smoke breaks have recently been banned(which I partly can understand), we certainly don't have time to eat, and even the luxury of sitting down for 30 seconds isn't feasible given the pace of our restaurant. I get the shit kicked out of me for 8 hours straight, and there are zero lulls in the action, it's 8 straight hours of brunch rush. I'm on my feet, speed walking and sweating, straight hustling, juking, jiving and tray hauling.... non-stop..... for these shifts. My movements might even appear choreographed to the untrained eye, as I rhythmically weave in and out of crowds of impatient patrons, balancing   
a tray of mimosa flutes in my right hand, gracefully traversing the spill laiden linoleum, stiff-arming your children as they grasp for the scalding hot plate of chocolate chip pancakes in my left hand, that by the way isn't even for the sticky handed brat anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the above description of my weekend serving shift, is something I can handle. I've adapted to it over the past year, and have minimal issues with the state of things. I'm making decent money, I've learned to never complain about a busy restaurant, and I even enjoy the fast paced environment. I DO however, at least expect management, and ownership, to recognize the intensity of such a shift, and the ""abnormality"" of an 8 hour straight, peak business rush. You certainly won't find many night time restaurants enduring rushes of this longevity, and even most other brunch restaurants, rarely see peak times exceed 5 hours. Relative to other restaurants, I consider these shifts long, and arduous. Naturally, I also expect management to take the intensity of such a shift, into consideration, when implementing policies and procedures, that effect scheduled times, and the overall format of shift length, breaks, and general time-frame of a shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Under new management as of a month ago, we are currently experiencing a myriad of policy adjustments, many of which are minor, many of which I have no contest. There has however, been an adjustment to our weekend scheduled start times, that of which have me starting an hour earlier than usual. Instead of 8:00am, I am now scheduled to start at 7:00am. I'll spare you the specifics(for a change), and summarize by saying there is ZERO justification for it, and no practical reasoning behind the decision. To clarify, a 10 hour shift to me, in general, isn't long. It's the specifics of this shift, the inability to sit down for even a second, the inability to eat even a snack, and the fact that 8 of these hours are  fast paced, speed-walking, ""help I'm in the weeds!"", sweaty turn and burn hours. *And to clarify, the state I am located in DOES NOT have any laws mandating breaks for specific shift lengths.* For management to add this extra hour, I find flippant, inconsiderate, and a classic example of a restaurant abusing the $2.33/hr labor law, in an effort to get a few extra polished glasses, a few extra silverware rollups. So fellow servers, I ask:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you find the above described shifts, to be a bit more labor intensive than your average restaurant? Do you agree that management should be a bit more cognizant of that potential aspect? Am I justified, am I reasonable, for considering putting in my notice of resignation, in response to such a schedule adjustment? Can we get a general consensus, that these aren't your average serving shifts? Or perhaps, am I being dramatic, crazy, or excessive? Are these shifts par for the course, and is this additional hour hardly worth mentioning?  If you took the time to read all of this, I hope it appeared semi-cohesive, rather than just the ramblings of a madman. And if you happen to respond with any feedback whatsoever, positive, or negative, or just anecdotal with your own experiences, I would appreciate it greatly.

I admit it was a foolish thing to say, but I told her to try not to give me any more black tables tonight so that I can hopefully at least break even. She laughed and said she understood, and for the rest of the night it seemed my problems were over.

Today I arrive at my shift and the GM immediately calls me into her office, explains she was told that I told the hostesses not to give me black tables. She said that its grossly inappropriate and that I am suspended until she talks to HR. I tried to tell her that that wasnt exactly what I said, I was angry at the situation, I said that in private so somebody must've overheard me, and that I am very sorry and am willing to write a letter of apology or apologize to anybody I offended in person. She told me not to bother and that I am ""Just digging a bigger hole"".

So here's how I feel about it. I admit that I shouldn't have said it and I apologized. None of the patrons heard it. It's not about racism, it's about my livelihood. If I got 8 gypsie tables who got everything comped or 8 tables with kids who spent very little money and made huge messes then I would also probably have asked the hostesses to change my seating arrangement. I believe this should have resulted written warning and possibly some sensitivity training. Instead I feel ambushed that they bring it up almost 2 weeks later and give me no avenue to repair any damage. I strongly believe I'm going to be let go because the manager didn't hear my side of the story. She is going to tell HR that I flat out of nowhere said ""No blacks at my table"" which isn't true. 

It also bothers me very much that they are so self-righteous about PC culture when we have our own black servers complaining about 10 dollar tips from black parties on 600 dollar+ banquet tabs. But the restauraunt wont autograt parties nooooooooo that might cost them customers who want to fuck the servers over with little to no tips. It's so annoying and I just wanted to vent and ask your opinions.",0,I think I got fired today. Was I in the wrong?,0

I was about 2 weeks out of training and was about as aware as you would expect a 18 year old at their first server job would be. I remember being sat down by management and told how important running duties are.

Well I remember someone saying the way to really make some money is to stay after people get cut because you usually make a Bill if you do. Well I let someone take my cut and I didn't know late at night they empty the big ass tea machine into about 12 pitchers. Then they pour a cup of bleach and then press the button to let the hot water fill and soak it   over night.

Well, I get in the weeds and I am in a rush to get 2 teas and a water to a 3 top family of people of color. I press the lever to the tea machine and water comes out... I think to myself, it's just water no point in grabbing another glass, just throw a lemon in it and they will be none the wiser. I see a tea pitcher and just fill up the other two.

I am in the back grabbing something and the dad makes a beeline to me and says, ""what did you put in our drink you white devil! you put some kind of chemical drink!"" I thought they were being overly dramatic so I walk over to the table and grab the drink and take a sip... holy fuck what is in there? I tell them I'll get another one, but of course they want to speak to a manager.

My manager comes over and explains what happens and I lied and said I poured out the water, but just used the same glass. I know, I'm a piece of shit. Manager transfers the table, comps their meal and gives them $250 in B.O.G. cards. Of course a week later they sue and said their daughter was vomiting and had to go to the hospital. I drink a huge gulp because I was doing it in front of them and could see the glass the glass looked full before doing so.

590,alientine21,0,t3_bcqls6,3,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bcqls6/too_many_dicks_figuratively_and_literally/,"I work in a pub. Once a year in august/September my city has this festive-week where all kinds of cultural things happen. Naturally, this is a busy time to work in the bar-industry, and on the day of this particular incident, I had pulled 13 hour shifts two days in a row. 

My boss (the owner of the pub) was there with a bunch of his friends, they had been there since early afternoon, and they were slamming jägerbombs like there was no tomorrow.  They were loud, rude, demanding that I came running to their table every other instant to take orders (which we do NOT do, people come to the counter to order and pay), and my boss would throw a fit every time I didn't literally walk away from a customer to be at their beck and call. 

His best friend (called Long-Nards, you'll figure out why), repeatedly stood up, pulled down his pants and waved his Dick and exceptionally long testicles around, and ended up being so drunk that he fell over and hit his head hard on a concrete edge. Told him to go to the hospital. He didn't, he drank more jägerbombs. This man is a family father. 

Now, let's leave Long-Nards at that, because believe it or not; this wasn't the worst guest (or penis) of the night. He was just a douche. 

Later that night, my boss seems to have gone home (phew), and we are literally running around trying to keep up with all the orders we are getting. 

We run out of vodka, which is a big problem in a bar, so I have to run down to the basement Usain Bolt style to grab some bottles. Which I can't, since the basement keys are missing. I figure that one of my coworkers must already be down there grabbing something else, fine, I'll just go down there and get them to let me in. 

Aaaand.... nothing. I stand there pounding the basement door (and then the windows) for several minutes, and nothing. 

I go back up and my colleague tells me that my boss goes down there once in a while when he's hammered, and I just have to keep pounding. Which is certainly a *fun* game that I *definitely* have time for in a bar filled with customers asking for vodka, which we cannot provide, because I'm locked out. 

I go back down there and this time I'm really letting the door have it. Finally, someone unlocks it from the inside and I barge in, to find my boss who almost seems mad at me for inconveniencing him like this - and some blonde girl, shamefully getting up from her knees, facing the wall and refusing to look at me. I just roll my eyes, grab the vodka (and the key) and head back up, leaving them to it. 

Didn't see either of them again that night, which was definitely a delight, but it means that they both sneaked out through the basement instead of heading back up to the bar, because they were nothing more that exactly what they looked like. Two drunk, horny people who just got busted mid-blowjob. 

Now, the woman was blonde, which is funny because THAT SAME DAY I had met my boss' wife and two small daughters who had dropped by to say hi and have a soda before the jägerbomb-hellscape had unfolded, and she wasn't very blonde. I heard through the grapevine he apparently does this every rime he's drunk. So yeah, cool dude. Great with customers, employees and wives.",0,Too many dicks. Figuratively and literally.,34

I work at a pizzeria and our menu is very to the point. We sell salads or pizza. Yet, a lot of people point at something and ask what’s in it, though the description of ingredients are written underneath. Some people just want you to read to them I suppose. 

Well. I had these two ladies come in. One is snobby right off the first hello. She had a bob cut, I knew what I was in for. 

This is what the menu looks like just so you can understand how dumb this question already sounds when you ask it. 

Pizza’s- 
12 inch
16 inch 
18 inch 

Bob cut lady immediately asks 
“What’s the smallest pizza you have here?”
I respond- “the 12 inch is the smallest, it’s about half an inch bigger than the plate all around, and it’s 6 slices.” 

She says with a big attitude- 
“NO. I ASKED you, what the smallest pizza you have here is.”
I’m thinking to myself like... what did she just think I said...???
Here’s the rest of the conversation.

“Yes, the smallest is the 12 inch...”

“Yep”

bob cut: “And how many slices is that.”

“6 slices.” 

other girl: “So like, how big is it compared the plate here like the same size??”

So a woman came in with her family last night, I did the usual ""Hi what can I get you"" explaining the flavours. She had made a decision on a gluten heavy easter cookie, and I was about to move on to icecream when she changed her mind. She pointed to our only Gluten Free cookie and said that she'd like that one instead. This happens a lot because people see ""Choc Chip"" and want it, so I let her know that it's gluten free and we do have a normal chocolate chip available if she wants. She said no she wants the gluten free, cool. So when someone chooses the gluten free we have to ask them if they're coeliac or gluten intolerant just so we know to what level we should avoid contamination of the cookie. She replies ""yes"".

I have worked in the same casual pizza restaurant for 2 years, and ever since Ive been there I have occasionally served this same elderly man. He used to drink 2 schooners of a generic domestic beer, and almost always ordered potato skins ""well done"", reading his paper at his same table the entire meal. 

Over this time, I have watched his stability and mental sharpness decline. He now orders new things on the menu, something different every time, and  only drinks 1 schooner, and says ""I can't have more because I need to find my way home! He seems to suffer from maybe dementia. Lately he has missed lunches with a friend he sometimes dines with, and has sometimes says it is because he got lost on his way. He has forgotten the names of some things he always ordered, sometimes even his brand of beer.

Today, I was busy when he came in, and my coworker sat him at his table and poured his beer for me. When I got to the table to greet him as usual, he ordered ""Whatever I recommended"" and we had a pleasant chat about some options. I came back about 15 minutes later with his order, and asked if I could bring anything more for him. He said ""No, however I am disappointed that my beer was not full when you brought it to me earlier. There was at least this much room at the top of the glass,"" (he gestured about 1.5 inches). I nicely apologized, saw that he had drank half the beer already regardless, and said ""I'm sorry, I didn't actually pour your beer today, but if you'd like I could top it up a bit for you.""

I did so, and returned the beer to him three quarters full, having topped it up about 2 inches, to make up for what he said was missing when he got it. He scoffed and said ""I thought you were refilling it to the top!""
I explained as nicely as possible that I had meant I'd do this, just to make up for my coworker supposedly skimping on him the first time, so he would have a full beer. He laughed a little and went back to his meal, and sortof thanking me.

Later, when I bring him his bill, he remarks again that he was dissapointed that I didn't fully fill his beer. I again try to calmly explain that I did fill his beer from half-full to almost-full. He interrupts me and raises his voice, ""Do not argue with me. The customer is always right, and you will not tell me I drank half this beer. It was almost full and you brought it back exactly the same, and didn't top it up."" I tried to defend myself as politely as I could, apologizing again, and he continued to yell at me, making a scene my coworkers and other tables witnessed. He called me a liar, told me I couldn't speak to him that way, etc. He then told me he couldn't tip me today, and then left me a dollar.

He has always been sweet to us, and after this interaction I learned he was doing similar things to other servers, but had never raised his voice or yelled quite like that.
The managers are aware and keeping an eye. He will no longer be welcome in our restaurant next time he does something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I work at a faux Mexican chain.  You know the one, South Park made a joke about us causing blood in stool.

Our store is atypical because our hours vary depending on weekend vs weekday (btw, weekend is only defined as Saturday and Sunday, just for clarity). Fact of the matter is that we don't sell enough weekends to be open the normal hours, so we unlock the doors a half hour later and lock them two hours earlier. In layman's terms, we close at 8PM on those two days. It says so on our doors, and these hours have been in place for 2ish years about (likely longer, that's just when I specifically started).

Now, in fairness, Google and delivery services have a hard time remembering this. I'll grant that concession, so people do sometimes try to come in, it happens, we're usually nice about it and politely let them know that we're closed and people tend to understand.

It was Sunday. You know what that means, closin' at 8. I actually opened the next day (up at 6:30, clocked in at 7) and I was ahead of my schedule closing the back, so I hopped in front to give our line worker a hand around 7:50ish when she had a little spurt of last minute customers, no problem. I actually knew a few of the stragglers, so we were chatting while our cashier locked the door at 8 and I started helping my co-worker close her station. One of the other customers (not my friend) leaves, so he unlocks the door a couple minutes later, and forgets to relock it, no biggie. One or two people trickle in, and I let them know we're closed, and they leave.

8:05 rolls around. A guy comes in, lets call him ""Clarence"", he seems like a Clarence. He walks up to the line, I look up and nicely tell him we're closed. Here is roughly the conversation.

Me: Sorry sir, we're closed.

Clarence: Are you kidding me?

Me: No, sorry, we closed at 8.

Clarence: (Checks watch) It's 8:04!

Me: ...Yes, I'm sorry, we closed at 8

Clarence: The door was unlocked!

Me: That was a mistake, it was supposed to be locked, I apologize.

Clarence: So you're just gonna turn away a paying customer?

Me: Yes. Like I said, We're closed, we can't serve anymore.

Clarence: They're getting food!

Me: They came in before we closed, and they're food is just about finished already. We're in the process of closing.

Clarence: I can see food!

Me: It's being put away.

Clarence: Are you the manager!?

Me: No.

Clarence: Let me talk to the manager.

Me: Alright, I mean, she'll tell you the same thing.

Our cashier gets the manager, J.

Clarence: This guy is turning away a paying customer!

J: Sorry, we're closed, we close at 8.

Clarence: But I can see the food!

J: Look, usually we have the cash in the back by now, so we can't ring people up, but we're running a little late, so I guess we can make your food, but we are closed.

Clarence: Thanks you! Can you make it, because I don't trust him to. (Looks at me) What's your name?

Me: My name is ----

Clarence: Good. I'll be putting in a complaint. What's the number of the area manager?

(We give him a card, and my manager makes his food)

Clarence: (Looks at me while he checks out). You need to be trained better!

&amp;#x200B;

(In my head, I'm just thinking, ""What training does a person need to know what CLOSED means??)

&amp;#x200B;

We give him our GM's business card, get him his food and kick him out. I let my manager know an email is coming. He sent in a complaint 3 days later, and the amount of stuff he flat out lied about was ridiculous. He claimed that:

He came in at 8:03 (he was in at 8:05). The store had nothing on the doors indicating when we closed (we do). There were other customers being served (There weren't) and that the manager told him we weren't closed (We were). He then stated that I was ""awful"" and ""shouldn't be around customers"". Fuck you, Clarence. I hold a record for customer satisfaction in surveys and comments and was recognized by my former area managers as one of the best we had at customer service.

606,sadhostlol-,0,t3_bcno3y,5,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bcno3y/the_goodbadugly_of_hosting/,"I am a new hostess, I’ve been working for a month so far as one and it is very insane to say the least. Let me list off everything I’ve done and learned so far. 


1. Gained some respect by my coworkers, servers have said I’ve learned so much that I’m their “favorite” hostess. I have good diplomatic skills which are a plus. 

2. Buss tables for all my servers, faster for the ones with most requested sections and booths, because rotation. (Probably every host needs to hear this) 

3. Made deals with all servers, if one server with a table only section needs a table and all the servers are bitching, the one without booths picks up the booth, while the other is made up with a table. I let them both decide for themselves. This has been effective. 


4. Trained new hires, all 3 of them. For me being new, this was shocking, I was exactly 1 month in. Tip outs weren’t good but the opportunity was rewarding. 

5. I’ve even cleaned up literal poop so the new hires would not quit. (Took one for the team, we need people bad anyways. Wasn’t a good way to break someone into this job, I didn’t cry or say no. Just did it, later my boss said she felt bad for me and put me on break immediately). 


Now the other stuff.... the reasons why I find this job so... unrewarding. 

1. A person that was a head hostess, or a sparkle of my bosses eye, got jealous, has threatened to beat me up, made up lies to say I was mean or rude to her, and has belittled me as much as possible. Servers has saw this and went to management... nothing really happened. 

2. After training my new hires, my hours went from 36 to 20... (23 before breaks) I literally regret doing my job so well because I’d like to have my 10 ish hours back...

3. Two people who was in charge of training me never did... they called off and I closed my very first night all the way to the end of the week. They lost their jobs and got back in the clear and got their jobs back (how?). Kitchen workers trained me and told me how to rotate and communicate with them as well. 

4. Yelled at by other servers (the majority likes me. The others do not, I’m either hated or loved). Called “you people” as if they find hosts the swine.

5. Told by management I must complete something or I will not have a job. I.E. could not call off for an emergency one time but my coworker could not show up for a week straight and still have a job, and another could sit in the bathroom and not clean it, and not show up for half a week, oh and never clean a servers section). 

5.5. I am easily manipulated because management knows I never have called off in my past jobs and was in good standing, and knows I will work even if my pet dies, or a plane crashes in my house, because I do fear of losing any job I do get. So I’m placed with more responsibility because nobody else will do it. So I get the hard brunt of the work that the other hosts they hire won’t. 

I wanted a place to rant and also learn, so I found this subreddit. I wanted to in a way find a community that could be supportive. I feel so under appreciated, I’m falling into a deep depression. Even though I am well liked at my job I wonder about what it’s like being a server and I want to be so bad. My boss has told me hosting is the only thing I will be doing and then tells me I’ll be able to do other stuff. I feel like I’m on the back burner to pick up hours when these kids won’t work. I am 22, no school, and want to provide for my family, and some kids that work with me rarely ever show up at all. 


How does everyone else propose to dealing with this massive drama?  I love my job, I want more hours and I want to be a server. The bullying is getting out of hand, and is severely impacting my self esteem.

There was one time, though, that I still think about from time to time even though I haven't served in roughly 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

It was on a weekend night and my shift was as the breaker. I was on my LAST server for the evening, we go over his tables, he's picked up 3 tables out of his section (he was closer and it was at the end of the night) and we were still pretty busy. He introduces me to all of his tables (I think he had about 9 at the time?) and goes on his break. After about 20 minutes I notice that one table still doesn't have their food and the server had taken their order and put it in before he went on break. It's a family, a mom, a dad, 3 young children and a grandma. So I touch base with them, go to the back and check the posi system, and notice that he had taken the order but hadn't sent it in. This table had been really nice so far, a super mild mannered family, I figure I can handle it myself without getting a manager. So I go out and explain to him that there was a misunderstanding, I apologized profusely, and then told them that their food would be out shortly and that desert was on us. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mom immediately loses her shit. She blows up and screams at me that I am a complete idiot and that I must be ""special"" because I couldn't even take a food order, and that she has never met such a stupid person in her life; she tells me that I am the reason her children are starving and that it is already late and they don't have anymore time to waste with my uneducated self (like, lady, you came into eat dinner at 9pm...why is it my fault you went out to dinner late?) Her family is watching in horror as she berates me. I am crying at this point (I am v. sensitive) and the other tables in the restaurant are all staring at me as I am being publicly humiliated by this woman for a mistake that I didn't even make. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize again between sobs, no remorse on this lady's face, and I go get my manager, he ends up comping their entire meal and asks them to take it to go and leave. As they are waiting for their meal I still have \~10 minutes left of this break so I have to go check on the 8 other tables. I am just crying and asking, ""Can I get you another coke?"" One of the tables is SO pissed by the way the lady treated me that she gets up and hugs me and says, ""Don't worry, your other tables think you did a great job and that lady is a huge BITCH"" so that she can hear it. It still haunts me to this day, and I can still remember what this lady's face looks like.

So my restaurant has a no check policy, it’s posted at the door and in every menu. We have had the no check policy since the place opened so this isn’t a new thing. 

I had a four top in my section who was in general an ok table. They weren’t friendly but not rude either just had no interest in pleasantries. I figure they’ll be an in and out group so at least I’ll get a quick table turn. End of the meal comes and I drop off the ticket and when I circle back around I can see a check in the ticket book. I informed the gentleman that was paying that we didn’t accept checks and I would need some other form of payment. I tried to be as nice and understanding as possible because sometimes people just don’t pay attention to the signs.

He looks at me stone faced says “if you want this meal paid for you’ll take my check.” I reiterated our no check policy and pointed out that it’s posted in multiple areas of the restaurant and has been our policy since opening. He then tells me that is the only form of payment he has and he needs to see the manager. Well lo and behold I was the acting FOH manager for that day so I knew this was only going to get worse.  So I explained to the guy that I was the manager on duty and we still could not accept his check.  At this point the dude starts getting loud and aggressive and tells me I’m taking his fucking check and gets up from the table and as he does he shoulder checks me. As he’s leaving I told him if he walked out I’d be forced to call the cops for walking out on his bill. He spins around and gets up in my face screaming and cussing and calling me all kinds of names and swings on me. Luckily  his punch didn’t land solid and I was able to put some distance between us.

613,RyanMyDood,0,t3_bcmw2v,0,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bcmw2v/it_fked_up_my_order/,"   So I used to work at McDonald’s for a solid 5 or 6 months (I quit because management was literally the worst) an usually worked up front (taking orders on counter or taking orders for drive thru). Also, I’m a transgender man and I have been told that I look pretty masculine aside for my tatas and sometimes my voice if I’m not paying attention
   One day, about 3ish weeks into my job I was on counter with my best friend (We were so lucky to get the job together) and everything going as it usually went; some elderly regulars who liked to poke fun at the newbies, normal ass people just trying to get their food, you know the drill.
   Then this land whale walks in with her son and I’m assuming her mom. We will call this land whale, Lauren. Now Lauren looks like some Honkey Tonk bitch pulled straight out of Kentucky. She has a full on mullet, the missing teeth, the flannel and ripped jeans, she even had cowboy boots if I remember correctly; she also sounds like she smoked three packs a day everyday since she was 15
   Now I’m at the second register and my friend (who we will call AF: Amazing Friend) is on the first register. Lauren walks up to my register and starts rambling off her order. She is really rude the whole time, getting mad at me when I’m repeating the food she says and scoffing every time I ask her a question (even though we need to ask these question so we don’t get yelled at by the managers or the customers if we screw something up)
   I don’t remember much of her order now besides the two triples cheese burgers she got with “N O O N I O N S!!”
   I repeat: ok so you wanted *lists off the entire order as she said it* and two triples with NO onions, is that everything for you today?”
   Lauren says yes like a teenager would say to their parent 
   I tell her what her total was and hand her the receipt and the cups they got and they left to wait for their food. I take another order and then get pulled away by the nice manager and she tells me to do something for her. As I am doing my job I go no where near the kitchen, I stay up front and in view of most of the customers. 
   All of the sudden I hear screaming coming from the counter. I’m kinda hard of hearing (years of blaring music does that to ya)  so I didn’t hear what she had said but I walked over to BAF and ask him what’s up. He is visibly pissed off and he turns to me and says 
   “ SHE JUST CALLED YOU A FUCKING IT!”
   I was shocked and really confused, I actually stood at my register and cried for a few second because I’m really self conscious and no one deserves to be called an “It” under any circumstances.
   Later, BAF tells me the whole story; Apparently Lauren rushes up to the counter, pushing a few other customers out of the way and angrily says 
“I want to speak to your manager! I said NO ONIONS and there are clearly onions on these burgers!”
   Unfortunately, the completely incompetent manager (we will call her IC: Incompetence Cunt) hears the commotion and walks up to BAF and Lauren
IC: “What’s the issue here?” 
Lauren: “He..she..IT! IT FUCKED UP MY ORDER! 
BAF:” HES A FUCKING HE!”
IC: “BAF I will handle this! I’m so sorry ma’am, we will get this fixed right away!”
   That’s when I walked up to BAF, he had a look like he wanted to kill both Lauren and IC. 
   What confused me the most though was that her receipt clearly said “No onions” on it and I went no where near the kitchen. How could I have possibly fucked up the order?
   I wish there was an upside to this story but unfortunately there isn’t, she got her two free burgers and continued to come in every now and again.          
   Thankfully I never had to take her order again because I got put in the kitchen shortly after that. I was on grill and BAF would let me know if she came in and so I would make some EXTRA SALTY burgers just for her.

We’re lucky if a customer even enters the building before 5pm.)

My manager went out back to take a smoke break and soon after I got a phone call.

So, of course, I answer the call and as I’m taking the customers card information for her payment, another customer walks in the door. Great.

We have a first-come-first-serve policy, so we just acknowledge the person that walked in, let them know that we’ll be with them in a moment and finish helping the first customer.

So I say hi and she ignores me. Cool, maybe I didn’t say it loud enough. Whatever.

So as I turn back around from saying hi, this woman shouts “Oh my GOD, is nobody gonna help me? I’ll go elsewhere if y’all ain’t gonna help me” and in my head I’m like, what? You just walked in the fucking door and I very *obviously* said hello to you and am very *obviously* busy with another customer? What the fuck?

So I finish taking this woman’s card number and place her order which all in all took under a minute, all while this woman is yelling that she’s going to go elsewhere and can’t believe she isn’t being helped.

However, during this time, she also left the building. Like, just walked outside for about ten seconds and then came back. Don’t know what that was about either.

I  was obviously taken back and I could tell that she was angry. 

Instead of getting pissed I decided to play around and call her ""auntie"". In our country we call people who just start looking wrinkly/looks old ""auntie"", and I pretty much squeezed the word in every sentence, just to rub it in that she is old. (No one likes that).

However, today I was closing a section at the restaurant I work at and I got sat with a one top. Normally when I see a one top I expect them to get something small and leave a pretty low tip due to their small tab, but for some unexpected reason I decided to try my absolute hardest to make sure they had the best time possible, making jokes with them, keeping their drinks refilled as soon as they needed it, etc. their tab only came out to $8.46 but when they left and I grabbed the check off the table they had left me $100 tip.

It was a slow ass Sunday. Like “only two people in the restaurant” slow. This couple from out of town were dining and honestly seemed fine and everything was going ok. Towards the end of the meal, the woman came up to me and said,
“We’re going to a church event soon, can you call a taxi for us?”

No one here in Arizona uses taxis. For those who are not familiar with AZ, it’s a massive state area wise, we have no useful public transportation, simply because of how spread out all the cities are. Everyone here either owns a car or takes the bus. We do have Uber, but it’s really only popular for drunken nights out. 

Anyways, because calling for a taxi and waiting for it to show up literally takes like two hours I said,
Me: “Ma’am I actually recommend you take Uber. It’s cheaper than a taxi and it will get you there faster.”

Lady: “I don’t have Uber.”

Me: “I can set it up on your phone for you.”

Lady: “No thanks, I am more comfortable with a taxi. I’m from out of town.”

Me: “Ok, I’ll call them for you.”

I call the taxi company and they needed all this info about the lady so I put them on hold and told her to come to the phone so she can talk to them. She literally refused. I had to go back and forth from the phone to her, to ask her questions that they needed. It was so unnecessary. She was making it so difficult. 

Finally when everything was done and she and her husband finished eating, they waited for their taxi, and waited, and waited. She came up to me angry:

L: “HOW LONG TIL THEY GET HERE?”

Me: “I don’t know ma’am taxis do take a long time here.”

L: “WELL, HOW LONG?!”

Me: “Ma’am I’m not sure, we’re not the taxi company.” (I deadass said that)

L: “ BUT WE NEED TO GET TO OUR CHURCH EVENT!”

Me: “Ma’am I can still install Uber for you-“

L:”NOOoo!!”

She then took matters into her own hands and went to our manager at the time. He was a huge pushover and had one of our servers personally drive them to their event. I thought that was totally weird and unprofessional. As she was walking out the door, she said to me “WHY CAN’T YOU SIMPLY JUST DO YOUR JOB?”

We run a takeaway service alongside having sit-in customers, and deliveroo. Our wait staff are all young girls from age 16-19.

It’s a relatively busy night, not the worst, but definitely running around 15-20 minutes late. We have around 4/5 people waiting at the bar as well as 15 or so deliveroo orders waiting, and the restaurant is almost full. 
There are two women sitting on table 3, seemingly enjoying their meal - everytime we clear the table they say the food is delicious, ask to take leftovers away, constantly ask for more drinks and extra prawn crackers etc. Their food came out promptly despite them ordering quite a large amount, and especially in comparison to the length that other tables had to wait that night. They then ask for their bill.

I walk down the restaurant to see one of my fellow waitresses talking to the table. One woman seems to be animatedly complaining about something. 
FW for Fellow Waitress, DC for disgruntled customer, B for boss.

DC: We waited at least 20/30 minutes between each course, it’s just absolutely unacceptable!

B: My apologies, we can offer yo-

DC: NO! Listen to me, I understand you have takeaways here as well. I could see that young woman (points at me) running up and down with them all night and as soon as customers came in they got their food, how come that didn’t happen for tables?

B: We give a wait time over the phone so customers will know how long to wait before they-

DC: In my professional business opinion, you should be concentrating on either the takeaway service or your restaurant and I know EXACTLY why you don’t: because you’re a greedy, greedy man. You just want to make all the money you can and can’t afford to lose business. You’re greedy and lazy.

B: I’m so-

DC: SHUT UP! I’M GIVING YOU BUSINESS ADVICE BUT YOU WONT TAKE IT BECAUSE YOURE GREEDY. YOU RUN A RIDICULOUS ESTABLISHMENT.

Full time student, so I worked a lot last summer and during every break from school. During the school year I usually work doubles Saturday and Sunday, plus Monday nights. I’m not the most corporate-perfect server, but I don’t make many mistakes and I get along with tables and coworkers well. 

I just decided to take a summer internship where I’ll be out of state for 6 weeks from June through mid July. I want to work as much as possible as soon as I finish my semester (early May) until right when I leave town. I don’t trust the managers to keep me on the schedule once they know I intend to leave. My current plan is to give 2 weeks notice before I leave for the internship, but ask them if they’d consider keeping me in the system for when I come back.... but I’m wondering if there’s a better way? 

I don’t trust the management for many reasons, but the main issue is that servers are disposable here. They don’t care about server turnover- they have said as much to my former coworkers that have tried to stand up to them about scheduling issues, not allowing breaks, etc.

Because of this, we got more than our fair share of entitled parents and their bratty spawn. But, we also had a lot of families that couldn't afford much when eating out, and they and their kids were always polite, even when something went wrong. Myself and the other servers always made sure to give them excellent service, because if we're only getting $2, I'd rather it be from someone who is actually nice. I will always remember one particular family, mainly their son, who I'm assuming was around 5-6.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it was just mom and son, sometimes both parents and son, or even the grandparents would just come in with the son. But every time when they came in, he would ask for extra cherries on his milkshake (the bright red maraschino ones). Sometimes when I would go to take the order, he'd just say ""Cherry-Cherries!"". The parents/grandparents would chuckle and order his food, telling him he'd have to wait for his cherries. I will never forget the first time they came in. I remember overhearing him asking his mom for them, and her saying something along the lines ""We'll I'll ask but they might say no"". She then asked how much it was for extra cherries. I replied it was no charge and the kid was ecstatic.

&amp;#x200B;

So, normally, when you put in for ""extra cherries"", you only get one extra. But I knew this kid would want more than one. So I brought out a small water cup filled with them (was probably around 10). His eyes nearly bulged out and he acted as if I had just brought him a truck load of candy and toys. He ate them all and asked his mom for more. She asked me again, apologizing to me, but I stopped her and said it was no trouble. So I brought out another cup of cherries. He wanted more after that but mom cut him off saying that they'd have to come again. So every week after that when they came in, they always asked for me, and their son would wait so painstakingly patiently to get his two cups of cherries. On his birthday I gave him free extra whip cream, and his mom even allowed him to have three cups of cherries. Seeing his giant grin as he devoured them always made my day better.

They requested some songs and as it was quiet enough, I was stupid enough to play them (they were really into EDM arghhh) one of them got annoyed as I wouldn’t sell him a board game we have for customers (but it’s my daughters birthday!) and were just constantly either vaping or passing out on the table.

One of them was planning a birthday party and was asking if he could book here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some advice. I have been at my job for about 6 months and all is well and fine with one big exception. I have never worked somewhere that your cc tips are on your paycheck, but this place is like that. I guess it probably is due to the amount of cash the place had to keep on hand to cash all the servers out. Truly, I don't mind it because it helps me budget, but the BIG thing is, I don't get to calculate my own tip-out. This is all well and fine, but i have been noticing a little bit too much is missing from my checks, in my opinion. I was wondering if there was any way to determine how much the checks should be on my own. I do use an app to keep track of how much I make and my sales, etc. (I use Just the Tips), but my checks always fall about $50-60 below the calculated amount in the app. I have been writing it off to taxes, but my GM recently got fired and some other weird stuff is going on, so it is making me nervous and I feel like I really need to figure it out. I mean, the owners are making PLENTY of money (I know this for a fact) and they don't need to be skimming off of my checks.

One of my first serving jobs was at a casual dining restaurant in a mall. It was a place that fueled my nightmares for quite a few years.

M: *opens window* Hi! Picking up an or-

BC: *throws coupon at me, literally* The name is Shaunda.

M: Okay, great! *pulls up order* it seems here that you have a large pizza and a 20oz soda, and this coupon is only for a free pizza. So your remaining total is going to be $1.69. Did you want to pay that with cash or card?

BC: What? What do you mean $1.69- ugh whatever. Just take the pop off.

M: Okay hun, no problem. I’ll go grab your order now!

M: Here you go dear! You’re all set unless there’s anything else I can get you!

BC: No, it’s fine.

M: Okay, have a good day! *closes window*

BC: HEY! EXCUSE ME! I NEED PLATES AND NAPKINS!

M: *opens window* Okay, give me just a second hun, I’ll put together a bag of those for you.

I finish helping the guy at the counter as I’m grabbing this bag of plates and napkins for her

M: Alrighty, you’re all set! Have a good one!

BC: I asked for plates and MINTS. Where are my MINTS?

M: *realizing that I misheard mints as napkins, or she just didn’t say mints and also knowing that we are currently out of mints* Oh! I’m sorry! I misheard you and thought you said napkins. We’re actually out of mints at the moment, I’m sorry about that. Is there anything else I can get ya?

BC: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE OUT OF MINTS?! HOW ARE YOU OUT OF MINTS?

M: We go through them pretty quickly and don’t get our next food shipment until a few days from now, so we’ll just temporarily be out until then. I’m sorry!

M: *Realizing that I’m squinting in the sun and may seem like I’m annoyed with her* Oh I’m not making a face I promise, I’m just squinting cause I can barely see you in the sun haha. My name is *insert name here* We really are out of mints for a few days though, it just happens sometimes. You’re more than welcome to come back and fill up when we have them in stock though!

BC: WELL YOU CAN’T TAKE THAT OUT ON YOUR CUSTOMERS. ARE YOU HAVING A BAD DAY OR SOMETHING? IS THAT WHY YOU AIN’T GOT NO MINTS?

M: No ma’am, we’re just out of stock. If you don’t mind, if there’s nothing else I can get you, I do have a customer at the counter who needs help. I hope you have a wonderful day!

Oh, but it doesn’t end there.

About 15 minutes later, she comes back *into the store* and asks to speak to a manager. I go and get the manager on duty because even though I could technically handle her complaint, I simply didn’t feel like it. I’d had enough of her and don’t think I could’ve remained nice if I had to.

My manager comes up and she tells him that I was “super rude”, “had no customer service” and “refused to give her mints”. My manager then confirmed that we did indeed not have mints and that I wasn’t lying or trying to be rude, I just couldn’t give her what she was asking for. She didn’t believe him until he showed her the empty box.

Then she asked for the corporate number so she could complain formally.

Everyone at my job knows that I’m a total sweetheart to my customers and genuinely enjoy interacting with them and am NEVER rude to them.

They sit down and start in on the bottle before I can even greet the table. The lady makes sure I know that she arranged with the manager to not pay corkage because she bought the wine from of us. Ok, no big deal. 

I answer 100,000 questions for them about the menu because they wouldn't open it up to read it. The lady actually said to me ""oh, just tell me what you have, it's too much work to look at all that."" 

Btw, we have a small, one-page menu.

Moving on....I see her opening a second bottle within about 15 minutes of the first. I offered to pour for the table and she SHRIEKED at me ""DON'T TOUCH THE WINE!"" 

Okaaaaay. 

They managed to spill several glasses and would not allow the server assistant or myself to clean it up. 

When we tried to deliver their food (2 shared entrees for 4 people), the server assistant tripped over an empty bottle that had rolled out from underneath the table and nearly lost the plates in his hands. He tried to pick up the offending bottle and the lady smacked him on the back and told him to leave it there, then shoo'd us off. 

Fast-forward to the end of the night, and they are the last people in house. They've moved themselves into a booth and are full-on making out and getting handsy. Reminder: they're in their mid-to-late 60's. 

Management won't kick them out or do anything because they're terrified of receiving bad reviews or someone complaining to ownership.  

So, just before they start humping in the booth, we start cleaning up around them, invading their privacy as much as possible. They finally leave. 

Underneath their table are 7 empty bottles of wine (only one of which is something that we carry). The lady had a huge purse, as most old ladies do. She must have been stashing them there.",0,Tripped over stash of empty wine bottles the customers were hiding under the table.,63

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CAST**\- ME as the server with no F's to give and WTF as a white trash fella whos intelligence must have been his dump stat.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE SCENARIO**\- WTF found paper in his eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

As anyone has read any of my previous posts knows, I work in a truck stop in the middle of small town MO. We get a lot of the rude, abrasive, disgusting, stereotypical truckers along with the gross, obese, dirty, meth &amp; drug filled white trash. Our buffet costs 10 bucks and comes with everything on it plus toast, two pancakes, and up to 6 eggs from the kitchen. If you don't like it, you can order breakfast, lunch, or dinner from the menu.

Lets set the background noise- *""Where am I taking this plate of artery clogging cinnamon roll french toast? To the drivers having a obnoxiously loud conversation about libtards, gun control, Obama, and gross sexual jokes to the high school server, or to the family at table 15 who asked if we had extra large chairs and are trying to convince us their child who has been running around and screaming about Chocolate Milk and Angry Birds is under 2 years old?""*

This couple sits down consisting of WTF and his wife; they inform me that they want two sodas, two straws, the buffet, 3 eggs from the kitchen, and to speak to a manager. I'm thinking, ""It's been one minute, how did I mess up already?""

I place the order in, inform the manager who is cooking, grab drinks and return to the table. They let me know that they wanted to talk about the terrible service they got yesterday from a server who was especially rude to them. I believe it at that point; some of the staff are barely better than the guests.

&amp;#x200B;

The manager and eggs are ready at the same time, so I walk with them both to the table. I drop off the eggs, and she sits and has a chat with the couple. When I return for the quality check is when the scenario goes down.

ME-And how is everything?WTF- ""It would be better. Found this in my eggs.""

&amp;#x200B;

WTF holds up a plate covered in yolk, bits of egg white, and sliver of paper. I try to play with the joke until I realize that he was serious about it. I am completely dumbfounded; from the shell, to the grill, to the plate; there is no paper that could have made its way there. I apologize the one time and take the plate to the back. Before dumping it I take a real good look and realize, it's a straw wrapper. I tell the dishwasher to hold the plate and I return for another ""quality check.""

I haven't done a prebuss yet so I look at the table making idle banter and note two straws and only one wrapper. Once the manager is done with the table, I tell her that there is no way the paper came from the kitchen. She tells me she actually saw him pull it out from under the eggs. I tell her, what I saw. She has to check the cameras anyways to verify the story about last nights service, so I pester her to check them. I believe that in the brief moment of confusion, he put his wrapper under the eggs before she sat down with them. Guess what...that's not what happened.

He transferred the eggs to a plate he had emptied (it was a bigger plate), where he discarded the straw wrapper earlier and didn't realize. I don't know if it was part of a con, or if he was really that stupid; I also don't know which I would it rather be cause both options speak loads about this person.

The table keeps bringing it up about the paper, and how the service today is just loads better than the disaster from the previous night. My responses changed from sympathetic to almost sardonic, but it's subtle enough that they don't pick up on it. This back and forth goes on for an hour until they finally leave. With a heavy sigh, I clean the table and get ready for the next disaster to blow through.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Does this 6 second grilled sirloin go to the couple at table 15 who are using their own pocket folding knives and have about 32 teeth between them? We're out of Pancakes??? We are a breakfast place with all you can eat pancakes and no one thought to check for batter??????? That's the third time this week!!!""*

I bring the waters to the table, and setting them down, the girl thanked me. I giggled a little bit as I said, “Oh, of course.

Obviously, if you read the previous post, you would know that they are delusional *(sorry, I am no longer going to be nice about it)*. As FOH knows, when we are busy, if someone asks for something, our answers can be short. Let’s look at this scenario!

Guest: Can I have another Bellini?

Me: Okay! or Sure! or Yup!

&amp;#x200B;

Oh my, THE AUDACITY. I was soooooo bitchy and rude. Were you expecting a “oh sure, it would be my absolute and immense pleasure to get your Bellini""?

Now, you might say, while reading this: It's not that big of deal. It's true. It isn't. I got over this party, and didn't let it affect me. Here is where this shit gets worse than I actually thought. I can truly get over three separate terrible reviews about the same situation from these fucks. However, there is a part of this situation that my GM enlightened me with as I was not **even** aware that had me: appalled, speechless, disgusted, all them SAT words

&amp;#x200B;

That entitled lopsided-titty demon-spawn bitch who posted the first review about me filmed me. Yes. They FILMED their interactions with me as evidence that I was being rude and were going to use it to try to coerce my manager into giving them a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

Hold up. Pause. Let me repeat that.

&amp;#x200B;

They. Filmed. Me. Without. My. Consent. To. Use. As. Evidence. To. Get. A. Refund.

I.. what? I am trying to understand what would entice someone to film their server. I am all for filming escalated situations to have evidence of illegal/abusive behavior. This was NOT the case. I am trying to accept that some **random** ass people I don’t know have video footage of me at work while I was serving/talking to them (*and I WAS BEING FUCKING NICE).* How creepy and inappropriate. Fuck being empathetic and looking at both sides. 

&amp;#x200B;

To Family C:  Initially, I did feel sorry that you did not enjoy your time with me, and that was the impression you had about me. After finding this out? I want you to never get your refund. I actually wish you had the worst fucking time, and I can go back in time, and **actually** be worse. *(I don't even care about trying to be a good server with y'all)*

Here is what I want for you: I hope that on your WORST day. A day where everything feels off, you are in a bad mood, you are massively bloated and you had a rough day at your dead-end job, you come home to relax. You get comfortable and are completely ready to recover. I hope you get those few moments of peace and reset your energy. I hope that while you walk towards your bed, fully prepared to rest for the night and conquer the day, you step on a LEGO on the most sensitive part of your foot. When you crouch down in pain, with your bitch ass tears streaming down your face, I hope you see my face and middle finger in the distance.

&amp;#x200B;

**To set the stage:**

 I'm working at a cheap restaurant chain where we offer table service and a drive thru. It's your typical Friday night and things are going about as good as they can. I'm the head server and I think there was one other adult server that's been there for a while and then 3-4 teen girls, the one we want to remember is a special snowflake that we'll call **Karen**. Karen thinks she's better and smarter than everyone else because she's taking college classes in High School. She didn't believe me when I told her I graduated HS with a 4.6 weighted GPA. She's a real entitled, elitist, piece of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manager tonight is a very nice middle aged lady who either was currently, or was before working there, a registered nurse. We'll call her **Barb**. 

&amp;#x200B;

BOH has a whole slew of people working, including a guy around the same age as me (early-mid 20's) that we'll call **Joe**. Joe apparently had a medical condition as a kid similar to epilepsy where he would get random seizures. He's for the most part grown out of it, but every once in a while, he'll get a short, mild seizure. When he was hired, he told all the managers about his condition, and what to do if it happens: 

1. Don't move the body other than to turn the person on their side to make sure they don't choke. Moving a person having a seizure can seriously harm them. 
2. He requested that no one calls 911 unless the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or is a more serious one (I think it's called a ""grand mal""). Joe and his family don't have a lot of money, and in the US, even if someone ELSE calls an ambulance for you, YOU have to pay the thousands of dollars for it, not too mention the cost of the hospital stay.

Simple right? Apparently no. Also, no one else knew about his condition until this night. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tale:**

So night is going the usual. Busy, tiring, etc. I'm at the server station which has a full view of the drive thru area via an opening in the wall made for faster moving from the kitchen to the dining and dishroom areas. Well all of a sudden the other drive thru people screaming for **Barb**. Apparently **Joe** had a seizure. **Barb** checked on him, told them to hold the drive thru until it is over, and then continued to watch **Joe.** I continue on in the dining room as there's nothing I can or should do about this. The other adult server is concerned like myself, but also understands that there's nothing she can do, and so minds her own business. **Karen,** on the other hand, **FREAKS OUT.** An approximate retelling of what I can remember:

&amp;#x200B;

**Karen:** So, like, no one is going to move him!?

**Me:** No, that could hurt him. 

**Karen:** Well we need to call 911! 

**Me:** Well **Barb** is a registered nurse, so I'm sure that she knows what she's doing. Also, **Joe** doesn't have a lot of money, going to the hospital in an ambulance could bankrupt him. (at this time, I had no knowledge of what he had told them upon being hired)

**Karen:** Well I just can't **BELIEVE** that **NO ONE** is doing **ANYTHING!**

**Me:** Well, **Barb** would never intentionally hurt any of us. She's doing what she knows is best.   


I walk away and do my job. In about a minute or two, **Joe** comes to. He goes to sit in the office and call his mom. BOH goes back to being normal. The person that was at the window when this happened, and SAW it happened. Still had the gall to ""demand to speak to the manager"" because they had to wait for their food. This event also backed up all milkshake orders as **Joe** had been blocking the machine. Despite telling people inside that one of our milkshake people just had a seizure, many still complained with. ""Well that's not MY problem! You shouldn't hire **disabled** people then!"" Ugh. Whatever. But that wasn't the worst of it. The worst was **Karen.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Joe** actually came out from the office after composing himself and tried to talk to her. And apologize for scaring her, but that he's okay, and that **Barb** only did what he had told her to do. ""Don't worry, I wasn't in any real danger"", etc. **Karen** refuses to calm down. She keeps going on now about how she ""doesn't feel safe"" here anymore. During this time, **Joe's mom** comes to pick him up. She talks with **Barb**. She **thanks** **Barb** for not calling an ambulance, and that they'll just go see his doctor tomorrow. A MUCH smaller bill than a hospital ER. **Karen**  sees all of this from the server station. She **STILL** will not calm the fuck down. She is insistent that we should have moved **Joe** and called 911. Even though she's essentially been told twice now, by **Joe and his own mother**, that both of those things would have been wrong in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I see her standing at the service station doing nothing, just looking at the dining room with a nasty, sour look on her face. I know **exactly** what's going on. She's pissed that we didn't do what she wanted, and that she was wrong. Her customers have empty drinks and no food despite it sitting in the window/ pass bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Hey, what are you doing? Your customers need service.

**Karen:** Oh no, I'm doing my side work and going home.

**Me:** What??? You weren't cut from the floor and your customers still need service. Do your job. 

**Karen:** No I mean I'm leaving because I don't feel safe here. 

**Me:** Well then if you are quitting, you need to leave the floor and go wait in the back because you're making your customers mad by seeing you stand here and ignore them. 

**Karen:** No, I don't feel safe going back there because if I had an accident, you would all **IGNORE** me. 

**Me:** You **KNOW** that's not what happened. If you don't want to work here, then you can't be in the server station, as it is employees only. Just leave. 

**Karen:** Well I **JUST DON'T FEEL SAFE** so I'm waiting for my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I give up, and go tell **Barb.** She rolls her eyes and transfers **Karen's** tables to me, and goes out and tell her that she doesn't have to do her side work, but she won't be able to collect the tips from the last tables because she refused service. **Karen** says something rude to her and stands in the lobby. I clean up the clusterfuck of a mess she just left us in. Her customers were very happy to see me take care of them and I made sure to tell them that their server has decided to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Karen's parents come.** And they yell at **Barb** for like half an hour. **Barb** is an angel through it all. She just stood there quietly and let the bitch of a mother chew her out about ""proper protocols"". **Karen** is standing beside her with a shit eating grin. Well, now I know how she grew to be such an absolute twat. Whenever she didn't get her way, she called her mommy and daddy to do her dirty work. **Barb** didn't bother trying to explain anything to anyone, because she knew that she had a written statement from both **Joe** and his mom. So any ""calls to corporate"" that this blowhard was threatening her wouldn't stick. They all finally leave, and the other adult server and I feel bad for **Barb**, but happy now that we don't have to deal with **Karen** anymore as she was a horrible server for obvious reasons.   


After all that, the GM rehired **Karen**, much to our dismay, a few months later. Surprise, surprise, when she didn't get her way about something, I think it was an argument over side work, she had another hissy fit. IIRC **Barb** was her manager that night and I think the only reason **Karen** was arguing was because she thought that she could win again. Only now, she was an adult. This time when she said ""I'm leaving"" **Barb** replied.  ""Okay, well you have to leave the premises **now** as you are an adult and trespassing. You can wait for your parents in the parking lot. You cannot come back to this store for any reason. Have a nice day."" **Karen** was absolutely astonished now that her being an adult meant she couldn't play the whole ""I don't feel saaaaaafe"" card anymore. I never saw her again after that. And I bet she was an absolute JOY to all of her professors in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, this story is why I refuse to call out behavior of others unless the group it affects is actually mad about it. People are able to speak for themselves and so it is just as bad to ""come to the rescue"" for someone who doesn't want it or ask for it as it is to be an ass to them.

She is wandering around near the front counter, looking around.  Usually in cases like this, the person is just looking for a takeout menu, so I grab one and approach her.

Me - “ Hi!   Are you looking for a take out menu?”

She stares at the menu in my hand like I’m trying to hand her a loose turd.

“ No. “ she says “ I was just looking at what you have.”

“ Would you like a take out menu?  We are closing up the shop right now.”

Her (completely ignoring my words.) “I think I’d just like a nice piece of cake.”

“Ok, well we are closed right now.”

“What?”

“ We closed a half an hour ago, ma’am.”

“ I want one of these cake slices”.  She points to pastry case, ignoring me again.  “ It’s a dollar, right?”

“I think you are confused, ma’am.  The cookies are a dollar. The cake is $3.  But I have already closed the register for the da...”

She begins rummaging through her purse.

“I’ll take the cake for $1” she says.

At this point, I am just bewildered.  I have no desire to reopen the register but I don’t want to send her away empty handed, so I just decide to hook her up.

“ I’ll tell you what.” I say “We are already closed for they day, but why don’t you just take a piece of cake on the house!”

I box up a piece of the cake, throw in a fork and hand it to her. She looks at the box.

“How much?”

“The register is closed so it’s on the house today!”

She snatches the box and walks out without a word.  
Really glad I made an effort for her now. 😡",0,Your Welcome!,25

At this chain pizza joint I worked in we did bingo weekly. I always had the same section and always had the same grumpy vaguely white-trash family. First couple of weeks were fine but they left one dirty diaper on the table. 


Then they did it two more times. So I said something like “hey this is unsanitary and there’s trash in the bathroom for this reason” and the mom was like “oh ok”

Happened two more weeks in a row 

And I told my manager cause I hate confrontation and didn’t want to mess up my tips. 

My manager went off a bit - along the lines of  “this is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen and if you can’t throw out your diapers in the bathroom don’t ever come back” and the family just was like “okay you didn’t have to be so rude about it” 

This was all pre diaper on the table my manager did it as a pre-warning kind of like just a reminder 



Went to clean off the table after they left - hasn’t seen a diaper - apparently they hid it wiped it on the table and left me $0 on a $50 tab. 

They never came back though so yay

TLDR: white trash family can’t throw baby diapers away in the bathroom upon being asked to do so again they stiff me and smear the diaper on the table and never come back

So, not a server but I used to work at a chocolate fondue store (if this doesn’t belong here please let me know) about 5 years ago, to make it simple we sold white, milk and dark chocolate which would be covering fruit of your choice, in addition to sundaes and fruit with whip cream, etc.

On this specific day a woman came up to me to order, she will be crazy lady (CL) and I’m me. 

Me: hello, welcome to place! How can I help you?

CL: give me some pineapple, bananas, apple...

Me: May I know what kind of product do you want first?

CL: Im telling you the fruit first

Me: I understand but I can’t start your order if I don’t know what product you want and what size 

CL: No, Im going to tell you the fruit first *continues to list fruit*

At my job we at least need to know what product you’re getting because sizes and prices vary so let’s say you want a fruit sundae, we only have one size for that which also happens to be the size of a large chocolate cup with fruit which costed more. 

I really didn’t feel like arguing with her so I pulled out a notepad and wrote down what she wanted while explaining to her I couldn’t fill the cup with the fruit yet because she wouldn’t tell me what she wanted and what size. So after a couple of minutes I finish her list and continue.

CL: I want the white stuff 

Me: you mean white chocolate?

CL: no no I don’t want chocolate, I want the white thing

Me: Whip Cream? 

CL: no oh my god THE WHITE THING

Me: vanilla ice cream?? *while pointing at the ice cream machine behind me*

CL: yes that, I want that

Me: Ok great! A sundae it is!

So she insists she pays me before I start the order so ok she pays me and so I fill the cup with the fruit she wanted and proceed to pour the ice cream on top

CL: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

Me: Excuse me?

CL: I TOLD YOU I WANTED THE WHITE THING 

Me: Im sorry mam, I asked you if you wanted ice cream and you said yes

CL: NO OH MY GOD I MEANT THIS

She proceeds to walk to the other side of the store and points directly at the white chocolate fountain 

Me: Oh, thats alright we can definitely change your order and the sundae costs the same as a small chocolate cup so I just need to switch cups...

CL: OH NO NO WAY I ALREADY PAID FOR THAT CUP YOU’RE GIVING IT TO ME IN THAT CUP

Me: Im sorry mam but this cup is the equivalent to a large chocolate cup, if you want this one I can reimburse you and you can purchase this size instead

CL: NO WAY NO NO GIVE IT TO ME IN THAT CUP NOW 

Me: I cannot do that so I can either serve you the small cup or refund you

CL: BUT YOU GOT IT WRONG WHY ARE YOU CHARGING ME FOR YOUR MISTAKE? 

She keeps screaming at me about how this is my mistake and she shouldn’t even be charged at all etc etc. She obviously asked for a manager (guess who?) got even more pissed when I continued to refuse her the larger cup and when I finally told her either she takes the cup or I will hand her back her cash and she needs to leave she agreed to take the small cup. 

But it doesn’t end there.

She walks away with her cup and a nasty look, and not 5 minutes later she comes back with a half empty cup and drops it in front of me

CL: YOU FORGOT THE BANANAS

Me: *looking directly at the banana pieces at the bottom of the cup* they’re right there, at the bottom

CL: THATS PINEAPPLE 

I seriously wanted her to leave before I went ballistic on her so I filled the cup a tiny bit with more bananas and handed it back to her

CL: wow I gave you 2 tries and you fucked up both times....

And she walks away... thankfully this was a seasonal job so I wasn’t there for much longer but I was pissed about it for a while. VERY thankful I don’t deal with people in the food industry anymore. 

TLDR: Lady comes in, asks for the “white thing” then agrees she want a sundae then screams at me because she actually wanted chocolate and wants to get the item for the price of the sundae which was much cheaper. I didn’t let it happen, gave her a smaller cup which is what she paid for, she leaves and comes back asking for more toppings I “forgot”.

It was an incredibly busy night, and most of our traffic was there for pickup as we didn’t do delivery. The restaurant is packed, there’s 25+ pizzas in the process of being made, baked, and boxed, nonstop orders are being called and walked in, and I’m taking phone orders while working the register. This guy comes in, walks up to the counter and says “Yeah, I’m here to pick up my pizza. Under Joe.”

I go to the pizzas ready for pick up and I don’t see a pizza for Joe. I looked to see if it was still being made and I can’t find his order. I returned to the counter. 

Me: Did you give a last name? We have an order for Joe Smith, two breakfast pizzas, is that you?

Joe: That’s not my last name and I didn’t give you one. I just ordered one large supreme pizza. It’s under Joe. 

Me: [check everything again, there is definitely not an order for Joe fitting that description] I’m sorry sir, but I’m not finding your order. What time did you call it in? Do you remember who you spoke with?

Joe: [rolling eyes, tone coming in hot] Are you kidding? I spoke with you, Jesus Christ. I called in, you took my order, said it would be ready in 20 minutes, and I’m actually 10 minutes late and it’s still not ready. Maybe you should figure out your timing a little better, huh? I’m not paying full price for this shit. 

More people stand in line behind him. So I’m racking my brain, trying to think of who the hell would have told him his food would be ready in 20 minutes, positive it wasn’t me. I can’t think of what else to tell him other than be honest and move on so I can get back to the rush. 

Me: Sir, I apologize, I don’t know who you spoke with when you ordered, but I assure you it wasn’t me. I can have the cooks throw in a pizza on the fly for you if you don’t mind hanging out for a bit. 

Joe: This is bullshit. Unbelievable, how could you be such an idiot. Is your really job that hard? My girlfriend is waiting in the car, and you expect me to waste more time here? I’m never coming here again. This pizza better be free. I’m gonna call in tomorrow and complain about you. 

Suddenly I have a break in my anger with this asshat, and realize I’m certain this guy has *never* called here. 

Me: Sir, what phone number did you call?

Joe: What. 

Me: I just want to know if you called this restaurant. Did you call 555-123-1234?

Joe: [scoffs, but his eyes dart around] Yeah. I’m not a fucking idiot. 

He pulls out his flip phone (dating myself) to search his call history so he can rub my “mistake” in my face. But he keeps staring at his phone. He looks up slowly, puzzled. 

“Wh—what’s the area code for this city?”

I tell him. 

“Well...um. What’s this area code?” he asked, showing me his phone. 

“That’s Des Moines, Iowa, sir. We’re in [city 200 miles away.] You must have looked up the phone number online and that was the first number that popped up.”

“Oh.” 

He didn’t apologize. He turned toward the door like he was going to leave. The people behind him in line were a combination of annoyed and fighting back laughter.

\*Look at the end for the edit: there was an unexpected development that makes this rant even more enraging."" 

Brief context: My restaurant is located in the part of city that is surrounded by 4 universities/popular millennial jobs. Therefore, brunch is one of our busiest shifts. We do on average 500-600 covers between 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM. I also had another large party (8) at the same time of bitchy 40-year-old white women who were just as rude. Other than that, I still had a full section (approx. 13 more people in different tables).

&amp;#x200B;

My ""banquet"" party (*we are going to call them: family C)* was meant to arrive at 12:30 PM (they did not)  It was supposed to be 15, but 8 showed up. Okay, that is fine. They still had a minimum ($420) to meet. At 12:45 PM, those who were there sat. Before I even said: ""Welcome to ...., my name is ..."", one of the older guests (there were 6 millennials and two parents (late 60s) at this point"" barked at me: ""DO Y'ALL HAVE BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me, with a smile: ""Yes, we do. The only rule is that you have to order an entrée with it.""

&amp;#x200B;

Once they all decided they were ordering bottomless, I said ""Welcome.., my name is .."" One of the millennial ladies cut me off before I got to the additions, and said: ""I have a $150 deposit, I want to use that for the check for me and him (points to the man next to her).""

Me: ""Yes, the deposit is applied to the final check.""

She deadass looked at me and said: ""No, we are splitting the check 10 ways, and I want the deposit to be used ONLY for me and him.""

Me: ""I apologize, the $150 is applied to the entire check, and then I can split it from there. If there is any issues with payment, at the end of your meal, I'll make sure a manager is taking care of it.""

The bar is backed the fuck up, with service bar tickets piling up (*we also have two full bars, so this is an indicator of how fucking busy we were.)* I drop off their drinks when they finally come about at the bar (*it took prooooobably 15 minutes).* A newly joined person was offended I didn't get her a drink, even though she just got there. Whatever. I go ring in and get her in overpriced sugar water Bellini.

Back to Family C, and another person joined. She asked for a mint tea. I had three for the people who ordered, but one of them was in the bathroom so I served her first. They were not ready to order so I went to grab more mimosas for these fucks. The older gentleman orders a cocktail, so I grab the heavy-completely wood menus (*we run out all the time, I try to return ASAP).* Family C decides NOW that they are ready, while I had mad shit in my hands.

Me: ""sure give me one moment, I am going to drop these off."" My request was **ignored.** They started rambling their orders off.

Great, now I am holding all this shit awkwardly, while I pull out my book, and struggle to write the order. Afterwards, the man who ordered the mint tea says to me: ""also I NEVER got my mint tea."" I put the order in, tend to my other tables, and go look for a mug. **SURPRISE**. We had no mugs/saucer/teapots/spoons.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, I was sweating, with my ""concentration face"" on. I have an RBF, and I cannot help it

&amp;#x200B;

While I am waiting for mugs and shit to come up from dish, I check on family C. The man who ordered the tea looks at me and barks at me: ""how many times do I have to ask for my mint tea to get it?"" I was beet-fucking-red because I know I got visibly angry, but tried to hide it with one of those smiles where your eyes look crazy. I literally go (while I am busy af), grab a dirty mug/saucer, grab a sponge, and wash it in the sink. He scoffed when I finally dropped it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview of Family C experience: got their apps on time, three entrees were sold out, so they had to order something else. it took them 15 minutes to order again, so we couldn't fire the food until 20 minutes after I actually fired. The restaurant is absolutely packed. It took 45 minutes for their food to come out, which is not okay but I also don't make their food. While they waited, I informed them of the status twice. We ran out of brunch bread (it is basically cake) to give them while they waited. I didn't send them an app, since they only order three apps to share amongst themselves. Y'all *cheap*. But also, if food wasn't coming out of the kitchen, why would I put in apps that probably won't get to the table fast enough? When they got their food, they flag my manager down a few minutes later and he goes over. They complained that their food was cold, but still wanted boxes to take it home??? While my manager is there, I went to grab their refills of mimosas. By now, they have had like 5 refills each. One of the pretentious millennials points to one of the guests glasses and says: ""he needs his SECOND refill NOW."" While I am doing this, one of the men (it was his 30th birthday) starts saying: ""I understand what you are trying to say, but I am talking about getting some discounts because the food and service was terrible."" They basically were refusing to pay their check. However, since they had a contract, they HAD to pay it. They were still over a hundred dollars away from their minium. They refused to get anything else or get a gift card to reach the minium. While talking to my FOH manager, they asked to speak to his ""superior"" who was the AGM. My restaurant group has a specific banquet coordinator. If they wish to receive a refund, they had to go through them. There was literally nothing we could do.

&amp;#x200B;

The AGM goes over, and talks to them. When the AGM left the table, I went to her and asked what was happening. She said that they were unhappy, said I was overwhelmed and did not want to serve them. WOOOOWWWW, okay. She said they didn't want to pay, but they couldn't leave w/o paying. She built the check for me, including the deposit, automatic gratuity (22% - 20% for me, 2% for concierge). I drop it off, they made a note that one of the sides that never came out (because he changed his order to an entree that included the item). I had to go to my manager to get it taken off, he forgot to apply the $150 deposit. I go over again, and the millennial cock-sucking bitch states: ""HOW IS THE CHECK HIGHER IF YOU REMOVED AN ITEM? OMG CAN YOU NOT GET IT RIGHT?""

At this point, I am annoyed as fuck. They let me know they were going to split it by amount. I give them a pen and simply reminded them to not forget tax when splitting the bill. One of the guests looks at me, sarcastically says: ""yeah we know that obvi (*yeah she said obvi)*, thanks.""

&amp;#x200B;

I came back multiple times, and these idiots were still trying to figure out their math. Dude, I get it, you are all early 30s to late 30s with the exception of the parents who were late 60s. It is obviously too much to give me four to five cards to split it evenly. No, you guys decided to come to an expensive restaurant, but couldn't afford to pay $78 each. Here is a financial tip from someone who is actually broke: don't spend what you can't afford. don't do what you can't afford.

&amp;#x200B;

They FINALLY leave. I spent NO time apologizing for their experience, because it was inaccurate. I need a cig, a drink, maybe a joint even to relax after that. While I was smoking (*a cig, calm down)* I randomly decided to check Yelp because I wondering how long it was before the bitch posted one about me.

&amp;#x200B;

It took no time. She wrote it while she was at my table. It was something along the lines: ""Our waitress X seems like she doesn't want to serve our party, and it's taking sometime to get the items we are requesting.""

&amp;#x200B;

K, bitch. You posted this review before y'all truly pissed me the fuck off. I kept smiling up until y'all decided y'all needed to discounts and compensation. After that, I was just cordial, and was trying to get y'all tf out of my section. *I am getting flashbacks from my Applebee's days, where if you breathed wrong, a table would complain and try to get free food.*

&amp;#x200B;

I had no problem with just one review. But almost a week later, the banquet coordinator decides ""no I am **not** refunding them, I am offering them a $100 gift card, but not actual money because fuck that. You went to the restaurant, you ate, you had whatever experience you decided to have, so you have to pay (*benefit of having a contract, eh*?)""

&amp;#x200B;

They left not one, not two, but three separate reviews. They literally used accounts that haven't been active in years/had no reviews. The first review that was posted when they were at the table, was updated to include that we offered them a gift card in exchange to remove the bad review (*not true, and the second review posted a week later literally proves it wasn't true lmaaooo).* The second review was posted by the man who kept asking for fucking mint tea. He was all like ""I have money, and I won't spend it here. blah blah blah I need to receive actual payment (not a gift card) to even consider coming back here."" Finally, the third review was actual comical to read. It was SO dramatic. It was the older gentleman who was in his late 60s who jumped on the bandwagon for shits and giggles. I shit you not his review was like ""well I would have to question why? why, did it take so long after we were seated to get water (*I pre watered their table LOL)?* why did our waitress X seem like she didn't want to take care of us? (*oh im sorry, I forgot my subordinate-iwilldieforyou-behavior at home with the fake smile that I have to keep plastered on my face to fight my RBF)""* The fact that he wrote his review starting off every sentence with why is fucking hilarious. \*insert ""why video from the pastor"" here\*

&amp;#x200B;

Like one customer before kept kissing his girlfriend like... everywhere.. and he didn’t hear me speak like three times because he was so occupied with his girlfriend. I work at a poke restaurant so it’s pretty much server and customer interaction the whole way through. So these customers are being all flirty with each other and I’m trying to just ask them “do you want a regular or a large” but they don’t hear me. And it’s so awkward to disrupt them cause then they glance at me and they’re like “:|”. Sometimes couples are dancing to the music together while I’m trying to serve them and they don’t pay attention and UGHHHHH.

Also sometimes when they make sexual references with each other to food and they’re joking with me too along with it I’m just like “oh...haha......” but really I don’t need to know your girlfriend likes her fish raw like she likes her dick okay (he implied it but didn’t specifically say dick) 

Please, if you go to a restaurant, keep your PDA at an appropriate level. If it is a romantic restaurant or a sit-down restaurant where it is appropriate and the environment calls for it, sure. But ahh, I dread being the person who has to disrupt a PDA customer couple so I can just take their order and go on to the next person!

It, which should’ve been a red flag.

So my packer makes the order. I have the big pizza box of nachos in my hands and I physically opened the box to show this man what was inside. It’s the chips, chicken, pico, guacamole, cheese, jalapeños etc. (ya know the shit that comes on LOADED nachos) and he said everything was great. I even got him EXTRA toppings. He checks his fish and chips. Same thing. No issue. He leaves me a tip and leaves.

The next day comes and I’m working the host stand. This is like 1pm on Sunday. He walks in with the box. But I can’t make out what he’s saying to the girl at the takeout counter. She eventually gets our manager and he walked over, briefly talked to the man and retrieved the box from him. But his face was weird. My manager comes over with the box and says “the man was unsatisfied with the nachos.” I asked how is that possible when he said everything was perfect. The next thing my manager did literally BLEW MY MIND.

My manager opened the box and it’s literally ONLY tortilla chips. Dry ass. Plain ass. Chips. I was so confused. I’m not sure what the purpose was but I was irritated because I was made to look as if I served him his nachos that way. My manager leaves to tell the kitchen to make him more. That’s when the old guy walks around the corner and points as me. He’s like “you never gave me tartar sauce either.” Mind you, I didn’t make the order (the packer did), he never asked for any if he noticed there wasn’t any and HE ATE ALL THE FISH AND CHIPS ANYWAY. 

Long story short, he ate the nachos, replaced the chips, ate the fish and chips and came back to complain. He got his whole meal recooked for free and I was so salty the rest of my shift 😂",0,"You ate the food, tried to replace it and now you want it remade??",276
669,paranoidforest,0,t3_bbhk2p,4,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bbhk2p/insane_manager_that_did_not_deserve_her_position/,"I was a server for about two years for a crummy restaurant that is best described as the Murphy's law of food service. It was a chain family diner restaurant in Pittsburgh, specifically in Squirrel Hill on Murray Ave. Most of my managers there were understanding and cool. Even the General Manager, who for all her faults in prioritizing money/corporate over her employees, still treated me with respect that was unexpected from a low-end shithole.

Enter Bitch. Bitch was yet another new manager, fresh out of corporate and definitely bottom-of-the-barrel, seeing as my workplace went through managers and servers like a woodchipper inhaling plywood. No, really, the turnover rate was awful. Now Bitch had possibly the worst attitude of the team, and that's even counting the other manager I despised who would yell at and belittle her servers for no other reason than she ""felt like yelling at someone"" her words, not mine.

Bitch was elderly, gangly, and her face drooped down to the floor. Really, I'll never meet another person who looked so sour without even trying. She had a short temper, and frequently lashed out at the servers as well as CUSTOMERS (we'll get to that). If servers asked her to change her tone and show respect, she would intentionally worsen the situation and send servers home, telling them not to return until they spoke with the GM, who was almost never in the restaurant.

There are three things that ultimately got her on my permanent shitlist. The first time I got a taste of her poor attitude was when I came to the back to ask her for an ETA of a customer's meal, a common practice that servers partook in with the cooks (they never minded if you were chill about it). For context, management cut corners so we only ever had 1-2 cooks at a time, and when rushes came, the manager on duty was expected to help cook. I'm a relatively formal and timid person with co-workers and superiors, it's in my nature. I lean over the food window and ask, ""Excuse me, \[Bitch Manager\], do you have an ETA on \[Customer's order\]?"" to which she glared at me and viciously spat back, ""I'm cooking it, aren't I?!""

Wanting to avoid conflict, but clearly taken aback at her unnecessary virulence, I said ""I know, I didn't mean to rush you, the customer has asked me to check.""

She just looked at me as if I had insulted her. Her ugly lips, which were wrinkled enough without strain, shriveled together like an abused leather seat still recovering from someone's bulbous ass. ""I said I'm working on it!""

This clearly isn't an appropriate answer to give to a customer, so I went back to them and explained that I saw it on the stove, it shouldn't be much longer, and even offered a free complimentary cup of soup or salad to eat while they waited.

Offense number two is a little hazy, but I remember it was busy that night and she intentionally misgendered me (I'm transgender). I told her what my correct pronouns were and she said that she didn't care, my performance was poor so she wasn't going to ""make accommodations for \[my\] comfort"". I told her I would tell the general manager if she was going to continue being discriminatory towards me, and she shut up after that.

The third and final nail in the coffin that cemented the unchangeable fact that this woman was irredeemable satan-spawn was when I was greeting one night. Spring was beginning and bugs were getting into the front end. Specifically bugs that looked like ants with wings. I FREAK OUT when I see bugs, let alone ones that FLY, so I tried to tell her in hopes that she would at least put a word in to the GM and work out maybe some kind of repellent. Clearly, customers would be upset to see bugs as well. I'm on the literal verge of a panic attack from how many times insects have landed on me/bitten me since my shift started and when I tried to ask for a moment to collect myself in the back, she said ""There are bugs EVERYWHERE. Get over it."" By the way, that night we comped literally $600 in food. That was beyond unacceptable.

Fast-forward to the last few months of my employment there. I was moving out of state soon and had told my GM, who always valued me because I'd stayed with that shit company when almost every other server would quit/get fired within a week or two, that if I'm scheduled with Bitch, I would walk out. Knowing that my work was more valuable than Bitch's she agreed to keep her from being scheduled on weekends as much as possible. One of the few nights we were forced to work together, a customer had politely asked to see a manager because she found a hair in her food. She didn't want a refund, she didn't want free food, she wanted her dish to be remade. I reluctantly went to get Bitch, who I overheard as I was bringing food and checking on a nearby table. She said TO THIS POOR GIRL'S FACE, ""Do you know what I think? I think that you didn't find hair in your food, you put it there.""

My expression turned into abject HORROR. The girl was clearly hurt and quietly said that she wasn't trying to start any trouble, she just wanted her food to be remade without hair in it. The man she was with piped up that they'd take their business elswhere and she said ""Okay, bye. Don't worry about your meal, you're getting it free just like you wanted. You want to-go boxes too? Mason, get them to-go boxes."" I fucking looked at the customers in disbelief and as soon as Bitch retreated to her cave (the back area), I followed after them and asked if they wanted to speak to the GM for that horrible behavior and even offered to buy them a pie with my own money. They declined and left me a tip despite not paying for or even eating most of their food, and I hope that if they went somewhere else to eat, they got service befitting of royalty.

The final straw for me, however, was one Saturday night. One of my last, in fact, before I was to move out of state. We were understaffed because Bitch decided to goad one of our best servers into arguing, telling her that she had a horrible attitude and go home. I have to wonder if she was aware of her hypocrisy or if she really was just delusional. We were swamped to the point where people were crowding the lobby forty minutes after close, still waiting for something as small as fucking cheese sticks. I stole so much soup and salad, I even made free milkshakes on the sly to keep people in the waiting area as appeased as possible. Everyone was so kind and patient with me, but understandably very upset with the service and how management was treating everyone. She tossed orders at people, slammed the pie fridge doors, stormed around the restaurant, spoke in an aggressive and condescending manner to everyone. She even tried to ring people out up front despite being needed in the kitchen AND not knowing how the fuck our POS worked. I tried to tell her that I could take care of everything, to which she fucking shoved receipts into my hands and said ""Fine! You clearly don't need my help up here so don't ask for me again.""

One customer chewed her ass out in front of me and I was fucking DELIGHTED. I would pay money to witness that sweet, sweet justice delivered to her one more time. Perhaps the best thing I heard, while not entirely true, was when he pointed out that I had done more for the customers than she was, and the way she was treating me was insane, because as someone who owned a business himself, he would do anything to have an employee this dedicated to customers. He also left me his business card and offered me a job if I ever needed one. I've never taken him up on the offer, but I still have that card. It's a nice momento that I regard with fondness.

That night I handed out corporate's number a LOT, happily encouraging customers to complain about Bitch's behavior without even being asked. Needless to say, an ex-coworker has informed me that Bitch no longer works there. Neither do I, but hey, I left on my own terms and she was just getting the right end of the karma stick.",0,Insane Manager that did not deserve her position.,28
670,sonjabae,0,t3_bbhsl4,38,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bbhsl4/im_leaving_my_job_tomorrow_with_no_notice/,"I recently started my first serving job at a new, local chain. I got very little to no training and was just expected to know what the fuck I was doing. They had me serving alone three days after hiring me. 

I had a couple times where I would accidentally input 2 of the same item or mess up an order and I would have to pay for the food. I thought whatever, I made a mistake and I’m gonna pay for it. But I was annoyed because these mistakes were happening because I had no training. It especially sucked because I have hearing problems (I’m only 18 but yes, and the manager knew this) and tend to mishear things and I would read back the order and I wouldn’t get corrected only to find out they weren’t paying attention and the order was wrong.

But if the kitchen messed up the order, or did something weird with the dish if I added a modifier and they fucked it up, I was still paying for it. I was losing a lot of money. 

After a few weeks I got better and made less and less mistakes but the pressure was still on. We’re severely understaffed because everyone quits and as a new server I would be taking on multiple tables I just couldn’t handle, because I was still getting the hang of something I’d never done before and was still learning how to time manage all the tables. 

I’m working open to close 6 days a week and half the time we’re slow in the AM so I’m making no tips. Keep in mind my hourly rate is only two something an hour. So my overtime pay was only 5.00.

I decided to quit when I saw my check today (3 weeks built up) 100 hours and only a 650$ check. What I wasn’t told in the beginning is my tips are shared with the untipped staff that makes the normal minimum wage while I make 2 dollars an hour, which IMO is ridiculous. All my coworkers complained that they were shorted on their checks, we don’t have a payroll company our checks are handwritten and calculated by the manager. We all asked about our checks and our concerned were dismissed.

This was a huge red flag, the money on my check wasn’t enough for the amount of work I do. It feels like I’m getting slave labor. I left work early today after “throwing up” and I will definitely not be returning tomorrow morning. I don’t care how unprofessional it is. I’m not toughing out another two weeks getting paid very little for 12, 13, 14 hour shifts. Maybe this just isn’t the industry for me but I’ll gladly go back to a retail job where my hours aren’t as ridiculous and I get a guaranteed wage.

Not to mention I’ve never been treated so badly as I have working here by the guests. In my other jobs (which I kept for a long time and gave notice) I would get cursed out every once and awhile but here that’s a regular thing and I get treated like a dog. Checkbooks waved in my face, my shirt being grabbed, being yelled at. It’s not worth it to me.

So for some context, I work at what we call a casual fine dining restaurant (emphasis on the casual a lot of the time) inside a botanical garden. On the second Tuesday of every month, the garden opens its doors to the public free of admission (it usually costs $20/person). Everyone who works at the restaurant dreads the second Tuesday of every month because you just get a different crowd of people. Most of them are  shocked at our prices, some of them have clearly never eaten at a full service restaurant before, a lot of people want us to cut a burger into 3 pieces for them, etc. Tip averages take a deep dive below 10% across the board on these days. Tenured servers request the day off to avoid the crazy. It’s a shit show all. day. 

Today was that Tuesday. 

In the middle of this monthly melee, I have a full section when a couple (mid 60’s ish) come in and the dude is pretty weird — making weird comments, using two straws to create a giant straw with which to drink his beverages, whatever. That’s fine, be weird. Everything is fine. Until the end. And this dude. This dude. He holds out a ten dollar bill in front of him and says, ‘Now this is your tip. And you can’t tell Don about it.’  I think he meant Trump??? I don’t have any idea. He continues, ‘And the only way it’s legal for you to get a cash without reporting it is if you just... find it.’ And that point he releases the $10 onto the floor, and sits back, obviously very proud of himself. 

I had no idea what to do so I just froze. To avoid bending over in front of him, I stepped on the bill, slid it to the next table, picked it up and walked away. Looking back, I wish I would have left it on the ground. It was a small thing, but it bruised my dignity pretty significantly for the day. And on Free Tuesday, dignity is a thing that tends to be in short supply. 

So, sir, because I didn’t have the presence of mind to say it at the time: Fuck you.

The outside smoking part was fine but i sat down to do it. I had been busting ass for 7 hours and 50 minutes and i was tired. 

This hit me way too hard. I was in a horrible mood for most of my shift that day. I am the cashier who calls you honey and sweety and smiles and laughs and makes chit chat.

I would like to start by saying that I have never expected or asked if an establishment gives industry discounts. I believe that regardless of your occupation or social status you should want to patronize an establishment without feeling a sense of entitlement. Nobody owes you anything.

Do yourself a favor and don't count on this as something that is built into your life.

I immediately thought of this place after it happened.  This happened Saturday night.  Might be kind of a long read.

I work at a pretty nice farm-to-table restaurant.  Not fine dining exactly, but it's fairly upscale.  After a pretty slow Saturday, we got a late rush and I had a 4 top move from the bar to one of my tables.  It was 3 women and an older gentleman that looked like if Sam Elliot was a beach bum.  HUGE mustache, mostly unbuttoned Tommy Bahama shirt, and numerous rum and cokes in his system.

We had a pretty good rapport going, their food took a little longer than I would have liked, but I had them laughing and happy through the meal.  As I was clearing the table, they do the SUPER FUN ""let's argue about who's going to pay"" game.  Both sides shoving credit cards at me while I have a handful of dirty dishes.

I tell them ""I'm going to take this to the kitchen and let you guys sort this out."" and walk away. Tropical Cowboy starts yelling across the dining room at me ""Hey!  HEY!  LOOK AT ME!"" But i keep walking.  After dropping my dishes off, I turn the corner and discover, to my horror, that the guy is IN THE FUCKING KITCHEN talking to the chef/owner.  I immediately go into panic damage control mode.  ""SIR.  SIR!  Why don't we go back to the table?  How about you follow me?  SIR.  THIS WAY SIR.""

Then, to my horror again, the owners wife rounds the corner and gives the guy a big hug and says ""OH HEYYYYYYY!""

Well, fuck.  He's friends with the owner.  His son helped open the restaurant.  Would have been nice to know.  So he finally leaves the kitchen and tells me to ""Calm down.""

Later back at the table, I think the worst is over.  We've slowed down and I'm having pretty good post-dinner conversation with a woman in her 20s, I guess his niece or something.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see him reaching towards me.  I think he's going for the pen in my front pocket but he reaches right past and gives my nipple a good solid pinch.  

The entire table goes silent, totally mortified.  Everyone's bright red and looking at me, wondering if I'm going to freak out or storm off.  The tension is unbearable.  I'm standing with my mouth open, mid sentence.  Old dude is sipping his rum and coke with a big grin on his face.  My brain is broken at this point, and I do the only thing I know to do in this situation.

I reach over and pinch his nipple.  The table immediately relaxes, everyone cracks up laughing, and the night is un-ruined.  Old dude pays the bill and leaves a hefty tip, and the girl tells me where she bartends and that I should come see her sometime.  The table next to them saw the whole thing and left me an even bigger tip, and tells the manager I have the patience of a saint.

Please people.  Don't pinch your server's nipples.  In fact, just don't fucking touch me.  I handled it okay but if I had been in a worse mood, or had a much more stressful night, things could have gone a lot differently.

Welcome to Hell, home of the Masters Golf Tournament. If you live in Augusta and work in FNB, I wish you guys good luck. I'm sure every town experiences something similar to what we are going through right now.

First off I would like to ask you to hold us in your thoughts as me and my restaurant crew tries to make our way through this week of hell. This week brings in a load of high-end clients and it's just an all-around SUPER STRESSFUL week.

That being said I'm looking for some advice as to how I can help keep morale high and attitudes positive among my staff and team members. I'm asking for help because of a situation that has unfolded.

One server, let's call her Suzanne, when she gets in the weeds she won't accept help when offered. She shuts down and her service starts to lack a lot. She really fucked up Sunday night and the owner of our restaurant was not happy. I am not sure of the details, but there were a lot of things that went wrong apparently.

I managed Monday morning, the first day of the masters, and he told me he wanted Suzanne to have a smaller section that night. He was really pissed because this of all weeks is not one you want to fuck up. We are selling 50$+ entrees and 300$+ bottles of wine. We have one shot this week and we have to get it right. Word of mouth is a powerful tool.

I told the night manager about the owner's request. This manager tends to spread a lot of drama, talks shit, and can definitely cause a rift between staff. ((Luckily she is leaving soon)) I was leaving my 10 hr work day and I saw them smoking and ""talking"" about the situation. Suzanne did not look happy. I overheard basically that she didn't want to take the blame for the situation. I mean who would? But I wasn't there that night so I have no say on the matter or opinion. I just follow orders...

Today, I walked in not as a manager but a server. From the moment the shift started Suzanne just had the biggest shit attitude and no one knew why. I thought at first it was just me but noticed she was being like this towards everyone. She wouldn't smile. She wouldn't talk to anyone. She was short, rude, snarky, and kinda a smart ass. She just looked pissed and like she didn't want to be there. I wanted to smack her across the face. THIS IS A HARD WEEK FOR ALL OF US but you don't see anyone else acting like a child. It's only Tuesday and this hell doesn't end until Monday. We just don't need this kinda shit happening especially not this early in the game.

Before I left for my break in between my double I asked some of the funnier kitchen guys to try and cheer her up. But I'm wondering if there is something that needs to be addressed here with her. Do I need to set her aside and talk to her and see what's bothering her? Or should I just let this blow over and not worry about it? Her attitude had an effect on the staff today and it was obvious. We just don't need that this week. So what can I do to help everyone stay happy and motivated? Especially when I have people like Suzanne that is bringing everyone else down. 

Thanks for your help and advice.",0,Server with an attitude is breaking down morale during Masters Tournament Week,6

Only one of them had ID, and he ordered 2 shots of our finest tequila. My co-bartender served both shots in one glass, and refused to bring an extra glass. (Duh. What do you think we are, stupid?)
Between courses, the entire table stepped out to smoke. Our busboy cleared their table, and found $230 in cash under the table.

I had 16 people walk in 45-15 minutes before close.  One table was some of our local college football players.  They all ordered strawberry lemonade (made at the bar) and needed sooo many refills.  They all ordered their own appetizer and food.  One of them told me how much he appreciated me and then stiffed me.  Two more left me $1; one on 50 and another on 35.

The next table was 3 adults and 4 kids.  Everyone kept switching positions so it was hard to keep track of.  While I was taking the childrens' order, the single woman exasperatedly asked 'Can I order yet?!'  When I passed out their food, the last plate fell off of the tray onto the floor.  Five minutes later, the single woman told me her prime rib was terrible and to take it away.  I tried multiple times to get her to tell me what was wrong with it and she still just kept saying 'It was bad'.  So I ring her in something else and the kitchen wants to murder me but is patient.

The last table was a table of people clearly from another country, this is only relevant because of bacon preferences.  Our menu is very clear and lists what everything is made of, save for the salads and soups.  This table ordered a Sampler which is cheese fries with bacon, macaroni bites, and onion rings.  They send it back when it comes out and say that they didn't know it had bacon.  I have the cheese fries remade; the kitchen hates me more.

I proceed to take their order which was an entre and an iced tea, and it came out to like $12. The leader of the pack pulled out a huuuuuuuuuuuuge wad of cash and flipped through it out in the open like nothing. He must’ve had at least $3000 in 10,20,50 &amp; 100s.

700,b0hannon,0,t3_bb4ys4,12,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bb4ys4/working_at_a_cuban_restaurant_rant/,"I’ve been working at a family owned Cuban place in Florida since I was 14, starting as a dishwasher and eventually becoming a server. The owners are a white couple with a few young kids, who live 5 minutes down the road from their restaurant. I got the job because they were my neighbors and family friends, and a lot of people in the town know the staff/ are just regulars (the place has been open for around 15 years now). My point is that the place is a small, family owned business with a loyal customer base and cheap food. We never have issues with any of these people we see all the time, they love the place. 

Which brings me to the people that don’t love the place. Obviously no restaurant is going to be universally liked, we can’t please everyone. But when a customer comes in and starts trashing the food/ staff/ menu because they’re hispanic and think they know better than us, I get annoyed. As of right now we don’t have any hispanic people working at the restaurant, simply because the majority of people who apply are white. We have had customers walk in, peer through the kitchen window, and turn around and leave because they only saw white chefs. 

All of our recipes come from the owners’ friend’s family cookbook (who is cuban). The issue is that Cuban dishes, like many ethnic dishes, can be made in dozens of ways depending on who’s making it. Items like ropa vieja, vaca frita, or arroz con pollo can be made many different ways, and there’s a very good chance the way your grandma made it will not be the same as the American Cuban restaurant you’re eating at. Not to mention people laughing at me when I don’t know spanish. I grew up in the US, at no point in time was learning spanish necessary for me. It might benefit me one day, but I’m not going to learn a language so I can be a server at a restaurant. I wonder if I went to a hamburger joint in Mexico and complained when the staff didn’t speak english what they would do. 

What finally drove me to rant about this issue has to do with  a new customer that came in the other day during the lunch shift. He was hispanic and nice enough, ended up ordering just a cuban sandwich. When he got it and I checked on him, he asked me “your deli guy isn’t cuban, is he?” So I told him the truth, I have no idea what race our “deli guy” is. His reason for asking was that a cuban sandwich isn’t supposed to have ham on it, it’s supposed to be roast turkey and roast pork. 

And this just floored me. Never have I been talked down to like an idiot by someone who had no idea what they were talking about like this. I can understand if you think a cuban should come with salami, like the italians do it, or with lettuce and tomato like others like it (we do ham, pork, mustard, pickle). But NO HAM? I just told him I had never heard that and walked away. Usually I can make up some crap about our recipes being different than others, but I just couldn’t bring myself to pretend that he was teaching me something about our food.

Another fun note is that all of the cuban people who come in and tell me our food isn’t authentic enough have probably not been to cuba recently. A friend of mine told me the majority of people in cuba eat a diet of rice, beans, and eggs. Im sure they’d think our food was fine.",0,Working at a Cuban restaurant (rant),13

Anyways, I had brought a snack for myself today; after the night guys had been there for a couple of hours it came up missing. Of course no one took it (so they claim).

I was upset and not as personable. Until one of our regulars pulled up and told me, “I know that you make sure to remember things and take care of me. I just want to let you know that I notice this and it is appreciated.” Made me smile the rest of my night!",0,A conversation that turned my day around,20
705,xohl,0,t3_bb09gv,38,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/bb09gv/is_this_normal_or_did_i_get_fired_unreasonably/,"So last week i started as a server at a little breakfast and brunch restaurant. During the interview, I told the owner i had no serving experience. 

My first day consisted of following around another server while she did not teach me anything. 

The very next day I was thrown out onto the floor having half the restaurant to myself. It was very stressful and the server who had been training me seemed annoyed whenever I asked her any questions. So I asked one of the cooks instead, and he would always be like “what?? They didn’t teach you that???” and kindly helped me out. 

It went pretty good and I made around $150 in tips on my first day of serving. I got food out on time, remembered all my tables (...half the restaurant. Ugh) and didn’t mess up further than writing something incorrectly on the ticket (which the cook helped me to correct). 

The next few days I started really getting the hang of it. Whenever I mentioned to customers I was new, they’d tell me I was doing a great job. On my first day (of serving, so my second day), I had an old lady come up to me and say “I have been watching you and you are just so sweet! I’m so glad you are working here and I hope to see you a lot!” And customers quickly began learning my name and wanting to chat for a second even when I wasn’t serving them. The other servers (except the one who was training me) said I was doing great as well. 

I really began loving my job as I’ve been wanting to be a server for quite some time. However I was pretty stressed because I kept having to ask for help/clarification (mostly from the cook because the training server seemed annoyed with me). But I was getting pretty comfortable with it and I really looked forward to going to work. 

But yesterday after a long Sunday shift, the owner stops me before I leave to talk to me. He said “I don’t think serving is your forte”, and I am clearly confused, as I know I have been doing a good job, especially for not having been trained AT ALL. He said that I never smile or talk to the customers, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Ask anyone I’ve served and they would tell you. I chat with them and I smile and I am very sweet and kind to them. And he continues “I’m gonna have to let you go.” And i don’t even say anything because I’m trying not to cry. He said the server (who had been “”””training”””” me) said I was “annoying” because I asked questions. I’m sorry... but I was not trained at all. I had no choice other than to ask questions. And the not smiling or talking to customers baffled me... first of all, he’s never even on the floor to see what I’m doing. And if he was, he would see that he’s very much wrong. He said “now if it wasn’t part of your personality, then I could train you to be better”... he doesn’t know my personality, and I was doing everything he said I wasn’t doing. I’m just so confused and by this point I am seriously having to fight off bawling. 

So I leave and immediately start crying my head off. I really loved this job. And I’m so confused. I wasn’t trained at all. Don’t you guys get more than 1 day of just following someone around while they ignore you? Or is that normal in serving? They knew I had no experience. 

To be fair, the owner was kind of picking on me since the beginning, he had asked me to take out my nose piercing even though one of my server coworkers had 4 piercings on her face and other one had a nose piercing as well. But I’m more concerned about why he fired me like that? I know I was doing well, damn well for having not been trained. 

I would just like some insight on this because I feel like this isn’t commonplace in serving, however I could be wrong. I still want to be a server, I am just very sad and confused by this. I didn’t ever see that coming.",0,Is this normal? Or did I get fired unreasonably?,33

We go to a local place that is pretty small (maybe 16-18 booths) but the food is good. They have a long front counter where you can order your food to go, with the rest of the counter being space for placing orders for the servers to take to their booths. I saw our order come up with the steam rising from my hot, fresh, crispy waffle. The servers were doing their own thing, tending to other customers, etc . and I watched forlornly as the steam dissipated until finally there was none at all (maybe 6 minutes). When it was delivered, it was cold and rather than ask it to be remade, I asked if perhaps they could put it in the microwave for a few seconds? It came back hot but soggy and subpar. (I ate it anyway.)

The counter was maybe 6 feet from us. If it happens again, would it be OK to pick it up ourselves if it's getting cold and the server doesn't notice that it's up?

This lady is really excited for this wine and says she wants to be “the taster” so I pour her her thing, which she then SPIT TAKES in my direction, then says “just kidding, tastes great” and motions her glass for me to fill it again. 
Her spit wine soaked my apron, got all over my arms, shirt, and face. I was a little shocked and so it seemed were the rest of the people at the table. One yells out “MOM!! I hope they don’t throw us out”, which I should have done, but the people at the table seemed mortified and remorseful so I just responded with “okay well you’re getting the smallest glass of wine...”

Dear god, was I wrong.
 
At peak rush hour, a family of about four comes in to order. Their order is taken, and as I’m putting other orders on a tray to take out, I hear behind me “make sure there’s extra chicken on it this time, last time you guys were fucking stupid and forgot it.” As soon as they left to go sit, my coworker and I looked at each other and sighed. We both knew how this was going to go.

We get them settled in, being out their food, check up on them regularly and refill their breadsticks at an incredible rate (like 10 breadsticks every five minutes. My oven is crying.) basically just trying to keep the peace. During the entire meal, he is incredibly rude. Demanding (not asking) for more breadsticks, leaving a mess on the table/floor, etc. Annoying, but not anything I hadn’t seen before.

Now they get up to leave, and we sigh with relief. 

He wasn’t done, apparently.

Now, where I work, we use very heavy ceramic dishes for our baked items. They’re SUPER hot, so we have to use a plate underneath a bowl to avoid burning fingers. They weigh about 3 (??) pounds with food in them. I have THREE of these dishes balanced on a tray, which is sitting on my right and and shoulder to carry it. I’ve got breadsticks in the other hand, so there’s little room for error in this scenario.

So as I’m leaving to the dining room, this GROWN MAN decides it would be a funny idea to jump out from behind a corner and scare the ever-loving shit out of me. While carrying heavy plates. That are hot. That he clearly watched me plate. 

Something along the lines of “NO sir! Do NOT DO THAT! DO NOT EVER DO THAT! THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY!” Came out of my mouth as I was standing there, struggling not to drop these plates that shifted out of position when I jumped a foot out of my fucking skin.
 

He had the audacity to laugh at me and complain to my manager that I “couldn’t take a joke” and “shouldn’t be so sensitive” when he could’ve caused injury to me and himself by scaring the shit out of me.

I hope to god he doesn’t come back, and if he does I’ve made it clear I won’t serve him.

Edit: There’s a lot of people shaming my manager for not stepping up, and I understand now why that was fucked up.

They let the others off the floor early to do the extra side work we all have, fuck call outs.

Well my favorite host took a handful of single people and double parties, while giving me more and larger groups. It was rough on us both but we made it through and both made money. She’s awaiting official server training until a few new cash/hosts are up to speed.

The cashier and I have an amazing work relationship. I let her know how much I make from time to time and have quickly motivated her to go for this promotion as soon as possible. She ran 1/3 of the tables during that period last night while fully hosting and cashing. I can’t wait until she officially make the jump, but in the meantime she always goes above and beyond!

Shout out to all our host/cashiers to help us out, we value you more then we can ever express, just getting drinks and silverware to our tables before we take an order saves us one of a few thousand trips to the floor that night!

Shit and even when I finally got caught up when people sat in the area she was unofficially serving in I helped her and took orders under her name. Would never mess with her making extra money the lazier hosts don’t try to.

Last Karen arrives at 7:30 so then they order. 

MIT then brings complimentary round of champagne to further tame the Karen's, seems to work, Karen's tell MIT things are great.

8:00 pm Bachlorette party leaves and on their way out calls Karen's out on their shitty attitudes and how rude they're treating their servers.

MIT keeps checking in on them and Karen's keep saying that things are fine but constantly state otherwise to servers, going as far to say that they won't be tipping.

Bill time comes, Server asks if they want split bills or one bill, birthday Karen says that since the night was such shit they want the server to do extra work and split their bills (which we just implemented a new POS system and there were still A LOT of kinks, separate billing takes 15 mins) and that they better see a discount on every bill. 

Karen's then state that some of them need to go throw up...

Cue 3 Karen's going up to host stand 10 mins later to yell at me (senior manager on shift) that they've been waiting 3 hours for their bill, another lady corrects her and says it's been an hour and a half... (uh huh sure, sounds legit) 

3 Karen's complain that:

First round of drinks took an hour (duh, I know, I agreed it's unacceptable and remind that we did not charge them for the drinks)

Service was slow and choppy, they clarify that the courses (4 course experience) came one right after the other, some before they finished the previous course... But they felt neglected and ignored and the service was slow... (are you confused? cuz I sure am)

Remaining Karen's come up and join in on the complaining as they got their bills they see no further discount beyond first round of drinks has been applied. 

Remaining Karen's complain that:

Experience took too long (told them that 3 hours was average but based on when they ordered it only took 2.5 hours) said they've been here before in a large group and its never been more than 2 hours (LIES, only possible if guests inform us immediately and we bust our asses to cut an hour off)

That the service was slow and they felt ignored but then tell the server, to his face, while he took payment that he gave great service and it's the restaurant and management's fault that failed (again do you follow? Cuz I sure don't) 

MIT states her interactions with them and how every time she checked on them they said things were fine, Birthday Karen says they NEVER said that...

After 10 mins of this nonsense back and forth I ask what could I do to try and salvage the evening at this point, birthday Karen asks me what I think I should do (I think to myself... I fucking already did what I think is fair Karen)

*As this is going on cue AMAZING table who overheard this whole interaction walk by and call the Karen's out on their shitty behaviour as they leave the restaurant (hallelujah there are good people in this world! I relished in them saying the things I can't)*

At this point the Karen's are more fired up so I cave and give them a 50% discount just to get them the hell out of my face. 

They accept but demand my boss's card so they can tell whoever is in charge of me what happened here tonight... (sure go ahead Karen, I'm not scared)

Some backstory: There's a lot of drama about why one of my coworkers left (in reality, she was 'fired') that I won't go into, but the gist of it is that a small minority in the restaurant banded together to out her after my former coworker reported one of them for inappropriate behavior at a workplace. 

One of my former coworker's regulars came in and ask her where she had been. One of the small minority decided to go up to them and tell them that she had been fired for doing drugs at the restaurant. NOT TRUE. The worst part is that he came into the kitchen with a smug look on his face and told all the waitstaff that he did that. 

I don't care if you don't like your coworkers, but don't be a humongous dick and spread mean-spirited lies about them. Be better.

Even years later, one of the tables I had there still stands out in my mind and still makes my blood boil. A middle aged couple was sat at one of my tables. I went through my usual routine, greeting, chatting, taking their drink orders. When it came time for their meal orders, the wife ordered a salad from the menu, as is. The husband however wanted to order our steak dinner, and he began making alterations and substitutions. Change out the side for this, add that - with each request, I plainly stated ""Absolutely, but just so you know, that will be $2.00 extra"" or however much each thing would cost. He said repeatedly that's fine, I understand, add it on there.They were extremely pleasant. While they were eating, I printed their check and was looking forward to what should be a fantastic tip on a larger bill. So, the moment comes where I drop off the check. I come bac a moment later to collect their card, as usual, and I get stopped in my tracks. The husband is holding up the bill, pointing to all of the upcharges for his requests and says ""What is all of this? Why am I being charged extra? You told me there was no charge."" Bewildered, I said ""Sir, I mentioned these upcharges when I took your order, and you said it was alright."" He shook his head angrily and said ""No, No i did not"" and then got up to go to the front and ask for a manager. Looking as shocked as I did, his wife said ""I remember you telling him that, he is wrong. Don't worry honey I will go take care of this."" I clear off their table, and then head to the front, and what do I find? BOTH OF THEM are near yelling at my manager that ""Our server didn't tell us all of this cost extra, he told us it was free!"" I could not believe and to this day still cannot believe the audacity of these people. What made it worse was my manager pulled me into the kitchen, proceeded to berate me in front of the entire staff for lying to customers,  and when I said that they were lying he said ""Why would they lie about this? For what reason would they possibly do that? Just admit that you messed up."" He walked away from me before I could continue to protest, and then comped their entire check so I lost out on my sales, tips, and wasted my time entirely on this couple.

Had a lady come in at 9 alone and ask for a table for 2 but the other person wasn’t here yet. We’re slow so it’s no problem. She sits down has water and eventually orders an appetizer to eat while she waits for the other person.

Eventually, around 9:45, the man arrives and they switch to another larger table set for 6 (again not a problem as we aren’t busy and we close at 10 so they can have whichever table they want) as they say they are slow eaters and will have multiple plates on the table. In addition to the previous appetizer they order a salad to share, a pizza to share, and a bottle of wine.

I’m attentive to them for the duration of their meal making sure to keep their waters filled and to pour their wine for them as well as box up the salad and pizza they couldn’t finish. At about 10:30 (30 minutes after close) when I’ve finished pouring their bottle of wine and am refilling their water the man says, “we can settle up if it helps you.” And I say, “no, please enjoy your wine, it’s my pleasure.” I continue to finish my side work and even finish a number of my opening tasks for the next day to make it easier for me tomorrow. At 11:00, after they’ve paid their bill and have maybe 1 sip of wine left, the owner tells me I can go home as he and his wife are sitting at a table talking and drinking their wine and they can finish up.

So I go to my table and I say, “thank you so much for tonight. It’s been a pleasure having you tonight. I’m leaving the floor for the evening, however, if you need anything else “Owner 1” and “Owner 2” are here to help you for the remainder of your evening.” And with that I leave to the back to get my backpack and coat to leave. 

I come back to the front and my gf who was sitting at a table waiting for me to get off tells myself and the owner that they made a huff and got up saying “wow! I thought we were guests!”

I’m just confused honestly. No one was kicking you out. You were welcome to stay and finish your sip of wine, I just won’t be here for it as the only thing left to do is run the end of day which the owner does so there’s no reason to have me on the payroll doing nothing.

So, my final table last night walked in and I could tell that the two of them were gonna be fun. 

Me: Hi th-

Him: WE WANT THE HAPPY HOUR STUFF.

Me: ""....okay, so... table for two?""

I then asked what they'd like to drink

Him: What kinda beer do you guys got?

Me: Well,

Him: *cuts me off* : Oh, domestic is on the happy hour menu. What's that?

Me: Domestic is anything made in this country, so stuff like,

Him: Oh, so Stella

Me: No, definitely not Stella. Canadian, Coors Lite, Bud.

Him: Okay we'll have two Coors.

Me: Awesome, bottle or draft?

Him: What's the difference? 

Me *thinking ""REALLY?!""*: Well, one comes in a bottle, and the other comes out of a tap.
Him: Which one's more?

I was about to ask ""more what? Amount of beer, or money?"" but the girl cut in then.
Her *in possibly the snottiest tone I've ever heard*: It says right there the draft is more. So I don't know why you're even asking us this. Why is he even asking us this?

Me: Okay, two bottles, coming up.

Everything after that was a bit normal, they ordered an app while looking at the menu. I brought out their app, and they started ordering. He ordered a caesar salad that comes discounted when you order a pasta. She ordered a pasta. Spaghetti alfredo with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.


Then this happened:

Her: Can I get like, a lot of mushrooms?

Me: Okay, so do you want a double order of mushrooms?

Her: No, I just want extra mushrooms.

Him: Yeah mean, like, we don't wanna order double of them, just get them to put like, extra mushrooms on it. Heavy on the mushrooms.

Me: Well, everything is weighed, so they put the same amount of mushrooms in every order. You'd have to order double if you want more.

Him: Nah man, you're not getting me. Just, just tell the chefs to put heavy mushrooms in it. They'll know what it means

Me *thinking AS IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HAVEN'T WORKED IN RESTAURANTS FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS*: Will do.

Her: Do you guys have feta?

Me: Yes

Her: Does it cost extra?

Me, now getting worried because they added stuff already to the pasta: Yes, every addition to the pasta costs extra.

Her: Okay never mind.

And with that, we were done ordering. I didn't tell the kitchen anything about the mushrooms. Things are fine, I bring their order out, do a quality check, and then later, guy flag me down and asks for more garlic toast because it's ""so good"". Well, at first he asked for ""more bread"" so I had to clarify which bread he meant. He then ordered four more pieces of garlic toast. So I go punch that order in. Five seconds after I punch in the order, buddy runs up to me.


Him: Hey, does that garlic toast cost extra?

Me: Yeah, when you order more things in a restaurant, we charge you for them.

Him: Ah, buddy, you didn't tell me that.


....WAS I SUPPOSED TO? Should I explain to everyone who comes into the restaurant that they *actually* have to PAY for things?

Him: Well, how much more is it?

Me *checks*: They're $2.39 for two pieces, and you wanted four, so about five bucks. 

Him: Can I cancel two of them?

Me: Sure... *as I run to the kitchen to stop them from putting in four pieces*


So, they get their garlic toast, I'm doing my close, and my coworker asks if I can watch the bar while she smokes. So I go over there and am standing around, wiping stuff, looking busy, and I see my best friend in the world get up from his seat in the dining room and walk back to the serving area and out of my sight. He was FULL ON *IN* the dish pit before I got to him. When I got there, he was talking to one of the kitchen guys with his plate of toast in hand. The kitchen guy (who no doubt stopped him before he went all the way into the kitchen) was telling him to talk to the manager.


Me: Hi there, what can I help you with?

Him: This toast man, it's not that good.

Me: Okay, first we need to get out of this area, customers aren't allowed in this area.

Him: HEY MAN. DON'T SHOO ME. (He didn't yell, he just said it quite forcefully)

Me: Okay, sorry about that. So, you don't like the garlic toast? What's wrong with it?

Him: I don't know, it's just not good. It's stale.

*I looked down at the plate. One piece was fully intact, and the other was cut in half with the other half missing*

Me: I don't know how it could be stale, I brought it right from the oven to your table.

Him: I dunno, it's just not as good as the first one

Me *fully done dealing with them*: Okay, so you don't want it. 


I took the plate away, and hoped it would be over soon. He asked for the bill about two minutes later, and I brought it over. He then asked for the machine, and I was very thankful. I got it ready as I walked over there and when I got there, he just tapped the billfold. So I looked inside, and there was nothing there. I looked at him and this happened


Him: Nah, man, just leave the machine, I'll do it when I'm ready.

Me: Well, I can't do that. I need to push certain buttons, and if I leave and you don't pay right away, the machine will time out and I'll have to come back and get it started for you again anyway. I can come back later if you aren't ready.

Him: Nah *starts fumbling in his pockets and pulls out a card*


The payment went through, I got the slip (with a whole 2 cents as a tip. Probably because he couldn't figure out how to not tip me), and went on my way. I'm about 99.9% certain they would've just gotten up and left if I had left the machine at their table. So I'm finishing up my close, walk near them, but can't see them, and the guy is looking pretty sketchy, so I figure they're doing something to mess with the table. After they leave, I go to clean their table and find their plates neatly stacked....

With their beer bottles on top, a thin menu placed on top of them, and the parm and pepper shakers balanced on top of that. I imagine they thought they got me good and had the last laugh, but jokes on them. The ""tower"" was very stable and took 0.2 seconds to take down, and they stacked their plates very nice and neatly for me to take to the dish pit. 

So, random couple who I'm pretty certain were quite stoned, if you're out there, I just want to thank you for making my job (at the very end at least) easier, and giving me a novel to post on reddit.

Happened a few hours ago. 

I work a local family run restaurant/ takeaway with an old pub across the road. Security guards who work there often order dinner gave us warning that there were a heap of people partying that were quite drunk. We had just locked up the courtyard and front entrance to the restaurant when a middle age woman came running down the drive, following the kitchen hand into the kitchen through the backdoor. She then ran past us and into the bathroom. Another lady had followed her but we told her to wait outside. After a minute, the headwaitress, J (a super lovely mum) checked on the lady to see if she was okay, but returned saying she didn't respond. 


We continued clean up, J checked on her a few times to make sure she was alright. Eventually the lady came out, she wasn't blind drunk - but she had clearly had a fair bit. J asked her if she was okay, and that the other lady was outside. The 1st lady said that they weren't friends , and she was trying to escape. She kept repeating constantly that they weren't friends.  J asked how she was getting home, to which she said a Uber was coming for her. J, unlocked the front door (as the kitchen had been mopped by now and is slippery), and waited out the front with her.

 The uber picked up the woman, and J approached the other woman who had been waiting for her. J offered to call a taxi to make sure woman 2 could get home, but it turned out woman 1 had the keys to a Air BnB and told her not to come back. 


By the time J got the work phone (having left the kitchen hand with the lady for safety), two undercover police had arrived. Woman 1 had called them. Woman 2 asked if they could take her to her home (nearly an hour away), and got upset when they said the train station was the best that they could do. She left with the police to get her stuff from the air bnb, and we left later far than usual and little confused.

I worked at a pizza place in the mid 90s with old school red booths and a sitdown Pac Man game.

A young couple in their late teens came in and sat down. It was already after 8pm and they had apparently gone to a movie earlier as they were talking quite loudly about (I know, wow, right?)

They order a supreme pan pizza (pepperoni, beef, pork, green pepper, onions). I ask if they want everything on the pizza and they both say yes. Less than 15 minutes later I bring it out and serve the first slice to her then a slice to him. Ask if everything is good and walk off to get some more drinks for them.

I hear a yell ""why does this pizza have onions on it?!!!?"" from across the dining room. Of course everyone stops to look, including me. This kid is standing on the booth, yelling at me. Immediately I walk back with their refilled cups to see what the problem was.

I get back to them and he immediately goes into a tirade about onions throughout the pizza. I apologize for the onions and offer to get a new one made. Instead he starts yelling about the green peppers and how they are super spicy (yes, bell pepper is spicy according to this guy) and I was just trying to make his night horrible. I look over at her and she has her face in her hands.

I rush to get a new pizza made for them, this time I confirm every item on the pizza and get it comped by my manager who was sitting in the back laughing at the absurdity. She finally goes out there to talk to them and this guy tells at her. I look their way and the girl is with her face in her hands again. 

The new pizza comes out and my manager and I both walk it out and again, I serve the first slice. He immediately goes off that the pizza is too hot and will cause injuries. My manager tells me to go away while she handles it. This time the girl gets up and walks towards the restroom. She stops me and apologizes for his behavior, that it was their first date and he bought a lot of stuff at the theater. 

I immediately understand what he is doing, he doesn't have any money so he is trying to get free food for his date. It worked.

My manager has gotten him to stop yelling and the young couple has started eating. They finish and get up to leave. She starts yelling at him for not tipping. He says I didn't deserve a tip after messing up so much. She calls him out for being a cheapskate and tosses some money on the table and walks off. He picks up the money and pockets it.

Out in the parking lot she starts yelling at him again. She walks in and asks if I got my tip, of course I answer no and she storms out again. Yelling at him for stealing. She walks back in dragging him behind her by the hand and forces him to give me the tip and apologize.

I don't think there was a second date.

I greeted them again, louder this time, and one of the girls looked up at me and said, ""I want a Sprite."" I knew what kind of table this was going to be, so I just wrote it down without saying anything. They all ordered a drink, I brought them their drinks, and asked them if they wanted an appetizer. *No response*. I ask again, louder this time. *No response.* So, I walked away.

5 minutes later I'm carrying 5 plates of food in my arms to the table directly next to them. As I'm setting down my other table's food, I hear a boy's voice. ""EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME!?"" I'm with my other table, so I ignore them for a moment and then return to the young table.

""Hi, are you ready to order?"" I ask one of the boys who I saw waving at me out of the corner of my eye.

He looks me and asks, ""Do you have an outlet?""

*He just wanted an outlet to charge his phone.* I tell him no, and he responds with, ""That's fucking bogus, bro."" I ignore the comment and ask if anyone is ready to order. One of the girls orders a steak entree. A couple of them order appetizers and more drinks.

20 minutes later, I set the steak down in front of the girl and ask her to cut into it to make sure it's grilled to her preference. Her boyfriend sitting beside her mumbles something under his breath (I still have no idea what he said) and his girlfriend told him to shut up. I lean down and politely ask, ""I'm sorry, what was that?""

He scoffs at me and replies ""Nothing,"" in a sharp, snarky tone. The same way a kid talking back to their mother would.

I blink. What was this child's problem? I hadn't done anything wrong, I was being as polite as ever and treating them with respect...so why was he acting like such a brat? I stare at him, but decide against barking something back in fear of getting in trouble. I smile and walk away.

I check on this table every 5 minutes *for 4 hours*. They eat a ton of the free bread and don't even have to ask for refills because I brought one before they could ask. I bring them their tabs, and one girl ditches the table and runs out on her tab. I had to pay for her. The others leave me $3 cash for a tip after 4 hours and over $150 between the 6 of them.

The group of 8 is a family, and they had come to have dinner after attending the wake of one of their family members. (Kind of a funeral for anyone not familiar) The wife of the man who passed was with them, and was elderly.

We knew something was wrong when they first walked in. The old woman started to get dizzy, and her family members practically carried her to their table. We asked repeatedly if she needed help and they said no. 

Throughout dinner their server kept telling us the woman was clearly not well. She could barely keep her head up and had to have someone else order for her. Right after they finished dinner, their server runs into the bar area and yells for my manager to call 911. 

The woman had collapsed on the ground and was not responding. One of the women at the bar was a police officer and former emt and rushed into the dining room to check on her. The old woman was breathing but still not responding. 

Ambulance comes and loads her up and her family members hug everyone on their way out, thanking us for helping. We all finally start closing up the restaurant (at this point it’s almost an hour past close) and their server goes to grab the check. 

The guy who paid (the old woman’s son) tipped $5 on a $150+ bill and wrote a note saying “food was shit”.

766,1919am,0,t3_ba13e3,4,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/ba13e3/the_past_few_shifts_have_been_interesting/,"So working today and yesterday has literally blown my mind with both how kind, and how dumb people can be.

Let's start with yesterday. A woman walks into the restaurant and says she is waiting for a friend so gets sat at my Co workers table of two. As I'm walking past I notice she's finished her starter and ask if I can remove it, no problems so far. She then asks if I can take her order, as I scan around my section I notice I'm up to date on all orders, check backs and food running and thought ""screw it, why not"" and proceeded to take her order of carbonara, a side of cheesy garlic bread and recommend a burger for her friend who still hasn't shown up. All the while she's looking me up and down smirking but I just put it down to another snobby guest. I thanked her and removed her plate. I then returned to my section to have a quick check of my guests and they're all fine (I've gotten a lot better at serving recently and I'm quite happy with staying on top of my section, soz for bragging) and walk past this woman's table again. So far she's on her second bottle of wine. She then stops me and quizzes me on what I see myself doing for the rest of my life so obviously I'm a bit taken back but tell her that I love my job and would be content on solely working in hospitality for the rest of my life, hopefully to get as far as owning my own business. She didn't seem too happy with that and asked if I had any degrees and what hobbies I did so rather than just walk away I indulged her questions with very simple responses, after all, it's just another guess, right? But get this, she then very clumbsily takes out a pen and a piece of paper, writes down her name and email and says,

""Give me an email tonight if you're ever interested in social care/social Work.""

I honestly thought she was joking and laughed asking her if she wanted me to send a CV over too to which she replied,

""No no, no CV needed. I can already tell you're right for the job.""

Erm... I'm pretty sure you need training and relevant qualifications to progress into that line of work but sure. I took the piece of paper, stuffed it in my pocket and thought nothing of it, just laughed to my manager in the kitchen. But get this. Her server comes running to the bar to us about half an hour later while I'm filling the glass wash saying table 16 just left with all her stuff ""for a smoke"" a whole ago and hasn't been back... The. Same. Woman. So naturally I let a manager I know her name (or at least the name she gave me) and her email. Turns out that was her real name and we have a mutual friend on Facebook... Another manager who's one of my close friends. But I have to ask, who even does that? Order's a starter, two meals, a side, two bottles of wine, literally gives an employee her contact details and bolts? The dumbest of the dumb...

I also had a group of three girls come in and sit at one of my tables who were absolutely lovely and at the end of their meal asked if they could request me on social media because they said I'm the kind of people they'd like to be friends with which was pretty sweet of them to say as I have difficulty making friends, and it doesn't go against our restaurant policy.

And moving into today. I had a table of nine younger girls (about 14 years old) who honestly were one of the most polite, sweetest tables I'd ever had the pleasure of serving. I gave them decent service as I usually do, ran their drinks and food without any issues and grabbed their desserts within 10 minutes of them ordering. They were chatty and friendly and being so young I didn't expect a top but again, that doesn't change my perspective on a table. Why should I give half assed service to a guest when all they're trying to do is enjoy a nice night out, right? I drop the bill and say I'll be back soon and when I return I was stunned. They'd handed me the money and the bill and told me,

""There's a £10ish tip in there for you too.""

Sorry... What? I was totally blown away by their kindness. All I could do was stutter and thank them and say how kind they all were. But what really shocked me was that these girls tidied their table, stacked their plates at one end and glasses at the other and all thanked me on their way out for the service. I honestly just wanted to shake the parents hands and thank these girls for being such an example! If you girls are reading this thank you so much for being so lovely! You guys honestly made my night! ",0,The past few shifts have been... Interesting,18

We always have to steal them off other tables because they keep going missing. We always chocked it out to being the customers taking them but we’ve never been able to catch one. Today I finally caught one in the wild.

It happened right after the lunch rush or else I honestly might not have noticed it. She was facing away from me, and at the angle she was sitting, I was perfectly out of her sight and about only ten feet away from her, and so I kind of crept up on her after I saw her slip the salt into her purse first. Just as she slipped the pepper in, I leaned in behind her, and so very kindly, in my absolute nicest and most professional voice, almost above a whisper, leaned in behind her and asked, “May I please have those back?”

I hope she was wearing Depends, because I’m pretty sure this old lady shit her pants.

She jumped first, but the look she gave me when she turned around was more of astonishment than embarrassment. She sheepishly told me she really liked them and wished she had some like that. I told her if we didn’t have such a problem with customers taking them and because of that we’re always short on S&amp;P, I would gladly give them to her if she would have just asked, but unfortunately the shortage struggle was really shitty. She handed me the grinders and looked up at me and gave me a sad look, like I took them away from her like she was a toddler or something. It was so weird. She left me $11 which is probably how much those salt and pepper grinders cost in the first place.

768,StarsAndTakoyaki,0,t3_ba2mq2,13,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/ba2mq2/advice_on_closing_early/,"I work at a Poke Restaurant with only two people per shift. I’m a college student and I usually work closing. 

Today we were overwhelmed with customers to the point we couldn’t even stop to make white rice or prep any other toppings for the next day because we had a constant flow of customers. I was frustrated because my managers had worked in the morning and had left all their dishes from the morning shift for us to clean at night. I’ve worked with them once a week every morning and they don’t bother cleaning dishes. They start to cook food in the back with the pan and watch shows on their laptops instead of washing dishes. We also had a lot to prep because it was a bit busy in the morning. Even if it was busy, they had time to just relax and chitchat whenever I worked with them for :9’e periods of time. For basically my whole shift, I stepped foot into the kitchen only to grab more toppings and fish. 

We usually have one person do toppings and one person do proteins and such. It seemed manageable at first, but people began ordering multiple bowls at a time to the point where our bucket of dishes was overflowing and didn’t even fit in the sink anymore. The whole floor had dishes on it. 

The employees are required to both serve and clean dishes at the end of the night. There is really only two of us and I don’t know why my boss only scheduled us two when he is aware that it is super busy on Friday nights. I’m sure if we had an extra person, we would have gotten out earlier.

We close at 8:30, but I tried to close after I was finished with the last order around 8:05 because most of the toppings were done and if I had refilled them again, there would be nearly none left for the morning shift and they would have to do the prep work we do at night for hours while also getting the restaurant ready. Also, a lot of people complain and try to get a discount from us when we don’t have enough, which I can’t do since I’m not the manager. We also had a lot of dishes to do. People think we have a dishwasher? Nope. We handwash all of our bowls, so when there is two people working and about 100 bowls and other trays, rice pots, and bins to clean, it got a bit overwhelming. However, the customer kept persisting we served them and I felt so guilty for trying to close early on them. I told them if the toppings we have left were fine, then we’d serve them. We did and they proceeded to order and one wanted their fish seared so I had to spend time cooking that. By then, more people started trickling in and it was about 8:27 when the last person left. We only got out a little before 10 because someone had come to help us wash the crazy amount of dishes we had. If not, we would have gotten out so much later. Usually, we get out at 9.

Because there were so many dishes and things we had to do, and not many things left for the customer to get the best quality of food, was it wrong for me to try to close a bit early and attempt to turn away a customer? I’m a bit new to the food industry and I really dislike when we obviously are ready to start cleaning up and a customer comes in and demands we serve them.

I know Poke is a fast food, but it’s hard to handle when there’s two people per shift and we’re responsible from prepping to serving to creating the bowls to cleaning.

tldr Is it rude for me to attempt to turn away customers at Poke who come in with a family of 5 when it is 8:05 and we close at 8:30? We usually start cleaning up at 8:15 but we can’t wash dishes if a family comes in. I’d be happy to serve maybe 1-2 people, but when a family comes in that requires both of us workers to come to the front and do an assembly line instead of one person starting to clean in the back, it makes it harder for us to close. And if we were to serve the family, a few more people would come in and we wouldn’t be able to turn them away. So I tried turning them away and we didn’t really have many proteins and toppings left since there wouldn’t be any left for the next day. So I allowed them to choose to be served if they were okay with what we had. Ended up serving two of the guys and another couple came in as a result.",0,Advice on closing early,8

Hey all, I'm back.  First, I just wanna say thank you for the love on Part 1.  I honestly didn't expect this little story to go anywhere, but here we are.  I have today off, so I'm actually able to sit down on my laptop and make this look pretty.  Without any further delay, let's finish up the tragedy of Mad Man.  


A day or two after MM's first visit, I was scheduled for a closing shift with my coworker, who we'll call Ray.  I arrived as the lunch rush was beginning, around noon.  **For context, on a typical day, foot/drive-thru traffic dips down for the remainder of the day until close.  Our store is also open later than most of the other locations in the district, so we'll get the occasional person grabbing a late lunch or snack; basically, it's not too difficult to run a store with just two people post-lunchtime.**

We went through the rush without incident, customers were getting their food out the window and from the counter in a timely manner.  Now around the start of my shift, I'd helped one person, who had come in and grabbed a half dozen, along with two sandwiches.  He'd seemed unusually dead-set on making absolutely sure that the sandwiches were correct, before going on his way without much fuss. Come 2:30-3ish, Ray and I are both getting our closing duties started and helping out people as needed.  Both of us are on the DT headsets, with one of us taking the orders and the other making the food.  We're both pretty quick on the draw in terms of answering when someone pulls up.  I'm cleaning the line when I hear the ding go off in my ear.  I answer with my typical ""Hi, what can I do for you?""  From the other end, I hear a curt voice reply, ""Yes, I had my colleague come here earlier to pick up some bagels and sandwiches.  My sandwich was not made correctly, and I would like to have it remade.""  I immediately remember the guy from earlier, and while I'm generally pretty good about order accuracy, I reason that perhaps his coworker had misread the order.  I give the usual dry apology (you know exactly what I'm talking about), and tell him to come up to the window.  I meet him, and since he had not bitten into the sandwich, I take it back, and remake it.  Salmon, onions, mayo, tomato, capers, and lettuce, all on a pumpernickel bagel... sound familiar?  I bring it back to him, apologize again, and leave the window, thinking that was that.  Well, it wasn't.  **Keep in mind, I'd only been told the story of MM at this point.  I'd not actually had the misfortune of meeting the legend himself, or so I thought.**  
A couple minutes later, we hear another ding, but the person has already driven up to the window.  Every now and then, we'll have an elderly driver or ever-observant individual ""not notice the speaker"", and while my coworkers and I continue to wonder if there are DTs without speakers to this day, we suck it up and meet these people at the window anyway.  This time, Ray gets to the window before me.  From the line, I can still make out the annoyed voice at the window.  Ray comes up next to me, rolling his eyes, with a sandwich in hand.  ""What'd I mess up"" I ask.  ""Do you remember that douchebag that General Manager banned the other day?""  I look at him incredulously.  ""No fucking way.  That's not-""  Ray nods, grinning and sighing before saying,  ""Let me deal with it.""   Now, I'm not someone that goes out of my way looking for a fight.  However, I can be pretty vindictive in certain situations, particularly when I know I'm in the right.  Fortunately, my patience and impulse control has improved thanks in part to my job, and I trusted Ray to handle MM.   


So Ray remakes the same sandwich, brings it to the window, while I keep my distance.  After several minutes, I hear the window slam shut, and a car revving away.  I walk over and see Ray texting quickly, a scowl on his face.  ""Soooooo we might be having a visit from the cops again.""  I begin laughing.  ""You're kidding, right?""  He nod, starting to laugh as well.  He fills me in; apparently, MM had decided that second time would be the charm, and tried to do THE EXACT SAME THING he had done with GM.  That's right.  Our antagonist wanted a remake of his Academy Award-winning performance, with another golden statue on top.  Ray calmly informed him that he not only knew the sandwich was made correctly BOTH times, but that he would allow MM to keep both sandwiches for free (typically, we'll just throw the dud away, but Ray did this more out of spite than anything else).  He also reiterated that all store staff, including himself, had been informed of MM's ban from service, and that if the situation further escalated, he'd be forced to call the police.  MM had replied, ""Oh, so that's how it is!  WHAT'S YOUR NAME?!""  Ray said, ""Sir, I don't think that's necessary.""  ""You people are unbelievable!  You brought this on yourselves!  YOU'LL BE SORRY!""  And, sure enough, 15 minutes later, a cop car rolls into the parking lot.  This time, a female officer comes inside the store, and asks to speak to the manager.  Ray and I both give our sides.  The officer doesn't even try to hide her amusement, and lets us know that we had nothing to worry about.  She grabbed a coffee, got back in her car, and drove away.    
So that's it, folks.  I know it wasn't as thrilling as the first part, but that's the tale of Mad Man.  We've not heard or seen MM since thankfully, and nothing has topped his saga since.  Thanks for reading!

EDIT/UPDATE: Back on mobile again.  I asked my boss if she’d heard anything from the police after this all went down.  MM apparently has had other incidents like this at other restaurants.  He’s got some sort of personality/dissociative disorder, and his family has been keeping closer tabs on him since the last outburst at our store.  I do feel sympathetic, as I have several friends with similar disorders.  However, I do feel that this could’ve been prevented or at least handled better.  Again, NOT SHAMING HIM OR HIS DISORDER.

I have this thing, and I guess it's just the stress of bills and life, where I shoot for 20% every table. Now, that's a good thing, at the same time it can be bad because when i don't get that 18-20%, and especially when i get below 15%, it really upsets me. 

I've gotten a lot better at not letting it get to me. 

I'm wondering though, what are YOUR tips for not letting it bother you.

It's mostly frustrating when it is a situation where say, the food came out wrong but was rang in correctly, and was the kitchen's fault. Or management took too long to come to a table and talk to them. Or the host didn't give them silverware, etc. And they take it out on the tip (on me, in other words). 

I know when i mess up, and i adjust myself accordingly. If i mess up on the order, or on the service, it's a lot easier to let it slide. 

But what is your advice for when something out of your control was the ""cause"" of a less than stellar tip, as far as not getting upset over it?

So this happened the week before Christmas. It was a really busy Saturday night and I had a big round table with 8 people at it. There was a second part of 10 that came in and they had a 7:30 reservation for the same table. The hostess told them that she was really sorry but they needed to wait a few minutes for the party of 8 to leave. Everyone seemed cool with it, and they went to the bar to get a few drinks while they waited.

7:45 they sat down at the table. I went over and apologized for the wait and took their drink orders. As I left to get their drinks, my bus boy brought them bread and water. When I came back to the table I saw one lady, we’ll call her Karen, standing up and dabbing at her pants. I also saw my busser apologizing profusely and offering her more napkins while he picked up some ice from the floor. Apparently he tipped a water glass on his tray accidentally and a little water spilled on her. I asked Karen if she was alright and she said very calmly, “no it’s okay! Accidents happen and it was just a little bit of water. I’m alright.” She also refused the extra napkins we offered her. 

All throughout dinner I checked on them and asked if they needed anything, how’s the food, etc. Everyone was happy, even Karen said everything was fine. Towards the end of the meal another guy at the table, Joe, privately told me to give him the bill at the end as he was treating everyone to dinner for Xmas. I gave him the bill. He paid for everything, including a 25% tip. The party got up, thanked me and my busser, and left. 

I collected the bill and went to the bar to give it to the manager so he could close it. Out of nowhere, Karen walks back in and said she wants to speak to a manager. She came up to me and my manager, and proceeded to tell him that this was the worst service she ever had in her whole life. They waited over an hour for their table, the busser spilled a lot of water on her (“my ass is STILL wet!”) and didn’t offer napkins, and the busser spilled food all over her cousin. (I later asked my busser if that happened and he said as he was clearing he dropped a fork on the floor near the cousin. The cousin was also pretty buzzed, and while trying to be funny exclaimed that my busser got food on him. Karen apparently missed the joke.)
At this point my manager looked at me to confirm that any of it is true, and I just stared at her with my jaw dropped. She also continued to say that our bathroom was covered in shit (which was a lie since we constantly check to make sure they’re clean) and that we should have offered to comp their desserts at the very least since they spent a lot of money. My manager snuck a glance at me that said he knew she was full of bullshit and fishing for a comp. Then she finished her tirade by sticking her finger in my face over the bar and exclaimed, “You know we were very generous with your tip, but if it wasn’t Christmas time you would get NOTHING!!!” and stormed out. I was so taken aback from the whole thing. Karen didn’t even pay for shit! Joe did!! Absolutely the worst customer I’ve ever had!

Incidents like this remind me why I preferred bar over serving.

It was a fairly busy night and I had several tables, but everything was going smoothly so far. I had one couple come in and just order some sodas and an entree a piece. No appetizers or alcohol or any menu substitutuons, so by all means they should have been an easy table and a guaranteed tip. I brought them their drinks and put their order in and went on doing my normal duties for my other guests. 

I wasn't in the kitchen when their food came out as I was taking another table's order at the time, but this shouldn't have been an issue as our busser staff was awesome and could take the food to its correct tables with no problems. It was also common for other servers to bring food to someone else's table if they had nothing to do and that table's server was busy.

So I went into the kitchen to check on my orders and saw that this particular couple's ticket was no longer up on the screen, nor was their food waiting to be delivered. ""Great!"" I thought. ""They have their food already!"" I went to go check on them to see if everything looked okay and their table was empty. No food. That's weird. 

I went and asked the kitchen ""Hey, do you remember sending out a personal pizza and a chicken dinner for table X?"" The cooks said they had put it up on the line and it had been taken. A busser said they saw server such-and-such take it. I went and found server such-and-such and asked about it, who confirmed that they had, in fact, taken my table's food. BUT. Now here's the fun part: they brought the food to table Y instead of table X. You may be thinking ""oh, that's no big deal, server such-and-such can just reread the ticket and bring the food to the correct table."" 

Nope. 

Instead what server such-and-such did was assume IT WAS A WRONG ORDER and that IT WAS MADE BY MISTAKE and THREW. IT. AWAY. Without even asking anyone else if they knew where it went! Or asking me, WHO PUT IN THE ORDER, where it should go! WHO DOES THAT?!?

And I took. Every. Single. Hit. For it.

I had to send in those entrees again, which had to be comped off the ticket, which hurt me. The guests were given a 50% discount by my manager, which hurt me. They had to wait around 40 minutes to even get their food, when it should have taken maybe 15, which hurt me. They ended up not tipping even though their bill was smaller and I did everything I could to make things right for them, and I can't really blame them because I was just as frustrated as they were. 

I was livid. Like crying angry tears.

Thank god it was a busy night and I was able to make up for it in tips. Although I still had what was practically a 150% comp on my checkout which sucked. 

What I would have given to be on bar that night instead and to be in charge of fulfilling and delivering all of my own orders. 

I heard that server such-and-such was fired recently and I can't say I'm that surprised.

Good ol ""Garnet Thursday"", the only restaurant where you can go in with a great mood and leave feeling shittier than the Great Mighty Poo. This story has apparent rudeness, angry managers and servers, and a woman so entitled she could put most entitled parents to shame.

TL;DR: Who the fuck puts a TL;DR at the beginning?

So for context, for those of you who have never read my stories here before, I work as a salad bar attendant at the aforementioned restaurant (Different name F.O.R.). 

One of my responsibilities is to fill up the salad bar whenever something is low, and to help me make sure I got everything out in at least one trip, I have a paper list detailing all of the stuff that's on the salad bar. 

If there's a customer there and they asked me if I'm going to get ""X item"" I usually give them a response like ""Oh yeah, I'm actually making my list right now, so I'll definitely get to that. Give me like 5 to 10 minutes and it should be out."" Generally speaking, that's an acceptable response.

Not for this woman...

FW: Fellow Worker, AM: Amazing Manager, EM: Edgelord Mom, ME: Miles Edgeworth (Do I really need to explain this one?)

So I'm at the salad bar making my list, when this woman with high knee boots, Spike gauges, a choker, black hair and black lips decides to grab a salad. This is the interaction that follows.

EM: Hey are grabbing more of ""X Item""?

ME: Yeah, I'm actually making my list right now, so I was going to be grabbing that anyway. But, give me like 5 minutes and I'll bring that out along with all the rest of my stuff!

EM: Oh, okay...

I didn't know it at the time, but apparently I had said something to offend that woman. I never said anything to her other than that I was grabbing more stuff, but I guess she really took what I said the wrong way, because my coworker came to me like 15 minutes later telling me something to this effect:

FW: Hey man, I just wanted to let you know you should try and be courteous to any customer because you never know which server is going to end up having to deal with them.

ME: Okay..? Why are you telling me this?

FW: apparently a customer didn't like the way you said something to them, and I'm taking care of them right now. I'm sure you weren't even aware you did it, but I take it that they're just being a bitch right now.

ME: Gee, what a shocker.

We both kinda just laughed and went back to work.

Fast forward another 30 minutes.

My manager was already in a bad mood when she started complaining about a bad customer. 

I don't know exactly what had happened, but basically by bullshitting and whining, she brought down a $40 dollar check to $9.

I'd asked my manager if what I had said was rude by saying exactly what I said to the customer. She told me to pay no mind to her.

When I finally put two and two together that ticket lady and salad lady were one and the same, I told my manage and she said

AM: Well good, thats one pain in our side we'll never have to deal with again. I gave FW permission to tell her never to come back.

See one thing you should know about my manager, is she does not like to be fucked with, especially if it's already been a rough day for her. And considering she had to open that morning she was already in a shitty mood

Oh, and here's the kicker. That $9 ticket? She only left a $3 tip. She would left just a 7% tip on what would have been a $40 ticket. What a scumbag.

TL;DR: What's the point of being on Reddit not even going to read the story. No TL;DR  for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Little bit of backround,parents and me lived in Canada for awhile where my pops decided to open a restaurant.

Keep in mind this was back in early 90's and it was a spanish restaurant so 90% of the people thought we were mexicans rofl.

Ok,its story time:

1.-

First day we open the restaurant 3 ladies come in and order a paella for 3 (proper paella takes from 30 to 45 minutes to make) and i told the ladies this but they still complained...yeah chef mike wasnt used in our restaurant (chef mike=microwave)

well anyway i serve the paella,give them 3 plates and ask if they want me to serve them or they prefer to do it,they say they will do it so i walk away.

not 1 minute later one of the ladies takes off her stiletto and start wacking the shit  out of the paella pan...im like WTH!!! lady WTH are you doing?

she started screaming at me saying there was a spider in the paella,told her to show it to me and she then pointed to the squid legs...

I really didnt know if to cry or just laugh,took out an encyclodia i kept in the restaurant (for doing homework,i was still in highschool) and showed her a picture of what a squid looked like.

Even with me showing her the picture she decided to leave,they refused to pay at first but when i stood by the door and didnt let them out we just ended up playing the waiting game,after 30 minutes they just paid.

&amp;#x200B;

ok second story,ill leave the best one for the end:

&amp;#x200B;

2.- We had out restaurant located in an area of the coast where they sold fish and chips (white rock/vancouver),we didnt serve fish and chips since we were a only spanish food restaurant but  we did have tapas to go.

We had a small side window where people placed their orders,so one day this lady and her daughter look at the menu and order some calamares to go.

just a FYI that calamares is the spanish version of calamari (greek),almost same batter but no tzatziki sauce because in spain we only server them with lemon wedges.

So i cook them calamares and hand them over to the lady,lemon wedges and all...she looks at it and then says in a  *contemptuous* tone ¿where is the tzatziki? and im like lady this is a spanish dish in spain we dont use that sauce we just use lemons wedges which we squeeze on top of the calamares.

Nah nah nah i want Tzatziki!!

im like lady,this is a spanish dish blah blah blah,i explained it all over again...and the damn lady just wouldnt shut up about that damn tzatziki sauce.

Tired of the situation i get out of the kitchen,go outside,look down at the lady and ask here in a serious quasi comical tone:

excuse me maam,do you know how to read?

lady looks back at me with a look of WTF!! of course i do,who do you think i am?

i respond,well it seems you do not know how to read...i point up to where the sign that was at the front of our restaurant and tell her:

please read.....i beg you,PLEASE READ!!!

thing is our restaurant was named Picasso's so ok,maybe you dont know that picasso was a spanish painter but then you had the huge letters that said SPANISH RESTAURANT!!!

told the lady we werent mexican,greek or any other country...we were SPANISH and in spain that is how we serve calamares.

&amp;#x200B;

last story,short but one of my favourites:

3.- 30'ish old guy comes in with 2 woman (they were pretty hot)

i sit them down and when i proceed to hand them the menus he says:

Nah we dont need them menus,this is a spanish restaurant right?

im like yes sir it is.

the douche then proceeds to say:

perfect,ok we want a big platter with an assortment of fajitas you know chicken,beef and whatnot.

some nachos,3 quesadillas and some extra guacamole.

I laughed for like a full minute while the guy and the 2 woman looked at me with a puzzled look,wish i could say i tried to educate them but to be honest that is not my job so i told them to GTFO of my restaurant hehe

The majority of our clients are business execs, often taking clients out to dinner. You are not special because you've been at IBM for 25 years. I literally see your type every night.

 I bet you thought you were being clever when you asked for the house wine to be served ONLY from a decanter and to never display the bottle at the table. I've been doing this for a while man, I knew instantly what you were going to do. But it didn't bother me. Again, you are not special to me. I'll do whatever I need to for a good tip.

Just as I expected, you drew on and on all night telling your client how special they were, how this dinner would show them the level of service You would provide yada yada. Your starters hadn't even hit the table before I heard you bragging about ""how expensive this wine was"" ""you only get the best from us"" bullshit. 

I know your type, but I was honestly surprised when I saw your tip; $20 on $400. Some people tip like shit, sure. But you paid with company money. I have a corporate card too. I know the tipping guidelines. Normally I wouldn't care less about a bad tip, but something about you rubbed me the wrong way. 

As you were browsing cigars to enjoy after dinner I was fortunate enough to chat with your prospective client. Did you know he himself waited tables in his younger years? Or that his 3 sons all work in the industry? I bet you wish you had. 

Normally I never discuss tips with my tables; it's just bad business. In this moment however, I felt you were worse business. So when your client asked me how much you tipped, I was honest with him. This left a bad taste in his mouth, but not as bad as when I told him about the con you pulled with the wine. 

I guess he realized that if you were quick the cheat the little guy, you wouldn't think twice about cheating him. Low and behold, you already had.

Flash forward to modern times and corporate AMEX days.
 
I had terrific service at this one particular place. It was the type of place that if a fork dropped, before it bounced a second time on the floor there was a new one there for us. The food, however, was crap. I mentioned the food quite didn't meet our expectations. My guest and I agreed privately, but I'm the one who spoke up.
 
At the end of the finished meal (gotta at least do that) the receipt was presented. I tipped a penny on the card. It was an expensive place, an expense account dinner for work. I know nobody even checks the signatures anymore and it's only used if it is disputed. ""food sucks yet great service"" in nice cursive.
 
I mentioned the dishes we ordered were ""not to our expectation"". Honestly, by that time we just wanted to get out of there and would rather get KFC but our stomachs were under enough stress already. The waiter wanted to make things right but no, there's nothing that could be done.
 
As we got up after the process, we waited until they took the check back and from a few people... the ice daggers were coming full out. I waved the waiter over as we stood at the coat check, and I palmed the guy a $50. (We were given so much to spend on incidentals). Told him the service was great, the presentation was awesome and above par, but the food really sucked.
 
I dated a chef once. I know they have knives and know how to use them or throw them, and what we would say, what the meal was like, it would probably ensue.
 
So I figured I'd tip him in cash where others wouldn't know, but send a message that the food, for the price, really sucked. I didn't want it to fall on the service.

This whole process was less than 5 minutes.

Then a man came and told me his food had disappeared while he was taking his young daughter to bathroom and their table was taken now. They were only halfway through their meal, which they’d waited ages for and which I’d thrown away.. There was nowhere to seat them and the new table had already ordered. 

This was a pay-at-the-register place and any staff can cash people out so the server had no idea this happened. I was forced to ask another table who hadn’t ordered food yet to go back to the waiting area with their coffees so I could reseat them and reorder their food.. I was mortified.

I was finally able to secure a college job in a local fish and chips restaurant that worked for me: it was close by and the hours were perfect. 

In the past I had worked as a bus boy in two different places, and while the owner knew I was inexperienced as a waiter, he flat out said he was willing to give me time to learn and be trained. Great right? 

So fast forward about a week: I passed the trial shift and worked 2 6 hour shifts on a Wednesday and busy Friday night respectively. Nothing about the place or pace had thrown me off aside from one customer's salad dressing options that weren't on the menu, and the owner said he loved the way I was interacting with the customers.

Eventually the owner asked for my pay details which I happily give, and I go off expecting to be shifted for the next week... Nothing. Radio silence. I finally get an email asking me to come in ""for a chat"", where the owner tells me that he likes my attitude and I hadn't done badly.... but he wants to hire someone with more experienced. He gives me £50 for 12 hours work (minimum wage in the UK meant that I was owed £84), and sends me on my merry way.

Three months of searching, only to find a good place and then be immediately shown the door, because ""ExPeRiEnCe"".

I had to serve plates of pizza slices and the first few rounds were fine, but suddenly the chef asks me to carry this huuge plate around. I was nervous, of course, but had the feeling it would go great.

For those who don't know, the restaurant I work at has at least one supervisor visit our store who times how long it takes for them to get their food.

This guy comes through, gets one thing (real supervisors get a meal to test a variety of quality), and says he's doing a shop of our store (supervisors never say).

He pulls up to get his food and neither I or fellow employees have seen him before. I should also mention that occasionally managers, from the store they work at, do shops also. There was no way in hell this guys was legit, despite the managerial badge he had. And the actions he did following that confirmed it.

We have lots of regulars and lots of big parties. My last party of eight before we instituted this policy ran me for over an hour and left me just under $5. 

I have been bracing myself to hear people complaining about this policy for two weeks, and there has been almost  none of that. The first day, a party of nine saw the sign and asked the manager if that was actually the policy and when they were told yes, they threatened to leave and the owner and management let them go. Apparently the owner wants to start weeding out some of the cheap-ass customers that seem to love coming to our place. 
We all usually make pretty good money so we sort of accept/endure those customers as part of the cost of doing business. But no more.


The first party of 11 that I served I was a single check and the person paying the bill handed me their card without even looking at the bill. I hesitantly informed her that this was actually my first time adding a gratuity per restaurant policy and I still wanted to ask her permission to put the 18% on. She replied with a very sharp ""NO"" and my heart sank a little. Then she went on to say ""I want 20%."" At least half of the parties that I've auto-gratted have asked to add more. One woman tried to complain to the hostess when the tip was added to her portion of the split check because she had to ask twice for a to-go cup. I overheard her and offered to remove her $3 from the bill but she relented and we just let it be.

So far, there is a noticable increase in tip % against sales. We are incentivized to upsell and sales are up, but we are also experiencing an increase in business due to a temporary tourist influx in our area. Not sure how it will pan out in the long run. 



Does anyone have any tips on how to talk to customers about this? Do you have a specific way of presenting the bill and informing them that the tip is included? 


Any experiences you want to share about adding gratuities automatically?

So Sunday, March 31 was my last day at my serving job. Why? My General Manager. He doesn’t like me. A few weeks ago, my baby sister (14) had to go to the hospital for a few days (attempted suicide) starting that Monday. My mom told me and my other sister that Monday where she was, which was obviously very upsetting. I had to work that Saturday so on Tuesday I called work. Of course the GM answers. This is the conversation that happened:
GM: “thank you for calling ———— this GM how can I help you?”
Me: “Hi GM it’s me, I’m not gonna be able to work at all this weekend”
GM: *already getting annoyed* “well why not?!”
Me: “my sister is in the hospital and she’s gonna get out in a couple of days and I think I should be home to take care of her and spend time with her.”
This, in my opinion, is where it should have ended. He should have just said sorry and that he’d see me my next shift after that. That’s not how it went tho. 
GM got really intrusive/nosy: “well what happened?”
Me: “I don’t want to get into it over the phone right now.”
GM: “well which sister is it?”
Me: “my youngest sister”
GM: “well how old is she?”
Me: “14. Listen, I’m not coming into work and I’m sorry. I will see you next time I work. Good bye.”

Am I over reacting? There are other managers/supervisors there who said they would have ended the conversation after I said my sister was in the hospital and they wouldn’t have pressed any further. I just feel like he shouldn’t have been so nosy. I know he probably has to be thorough to make sure people aren’t lying, but like, really? I just want to know if I’m overreacting. Thanks!

Said server had to pre close and I was stuck closing. I was pissed off. Everyone was pissed off over this. Most of the servers I told were quick to take my side as said “I don’t blame you”.  One even told me that she hopes you get fired or quit over this. Us Bussers catch enough shit at work no matter how hard we try, I got apologized to by several servers because our Bussers are so unreliable. Myself and maybe another busser are exceptions to this. And that’s just two out of the 9 total we have. It’s not fair to me or anyone else, if you are scheduled, you show up, unless it as a really bad situation. As a busser I try to help and make the servers jobs easier. I really hope you learned your lesson, as you ruined my night of relaxing after work.

I was a server/barista and I live in a very small country and in a town with a population of about 5000. During the winter it isn’t very crowded so when summer comes it hits you hard. 

Cafés and restaurants tend to rely on tourists and usually get huge profits from tourists and especially during town events such as festivals and when cruise ships come to town. 

The cafe that I was working at is very small and can only fit about 30 people inside and about 30 outside on the patio. And to top it all off there’s a maximum of 4 people who work each shift (2 people normally, one barista/server and a cook. The other two are called in during the shift to either take the server part, working the register or wash the dishes).

In the first weekend of August there’s a three day music festival in town (Thursday through Saturday) and I had the on call shift on Saturday, which means if they needed help they’d call me and I would come running to their rescue. Since that was my only shift throughout the festival I decided to go out drinking on Thursday night. I went out and I partied way too hard and wake up the next day with one of the worst hangovers of my life. At about 12:30pm a coworker of mine called me because she had found out that she was put on a double shift meaning she would be working from 1pm to 10pm. I agreed to take from 1pm-5:30pm and went down there. 

When I had been there for about 2 hours my boss (let’s call her Sharon) comes in. She obviously saw that I was not feeling well and told me to hide my hangover. When I finally got home at around 6:30 I noticed that I was in fact not hungover and actually had a very high fever (40 degrees Celsius to be exact, 104 degrees Fahrenheit) and I immediately posted on our Facebook group that I wouldn’t be able to be on call the next day and explain the situation. I even text Sharon to tell her with a referral from my mother who’s a doctor.

I woke up the next day feeling worse than the day before and my mom had forbidden me to even leave my bed. At about 5pm my phone vibrated. It took all the strength I had to pick up the phone. I looked and saw that it was Sharon. She was asking me to come in to work. I told her that I was too sick to come in. She was pretty annoyed and asked me to phone anyone on the team to cover me. I did it but I couldn’t find anyone who was willing to cover me. I told her that and she asks me to pop two painkillers and come into work. At this point I’m fuming with anger and I realise there’s nothing else to do but to quit. She kicked me out of the Facebook group within seconds of me quitting. 
I later found out that she was trash talking me all over town and would use me as an example to describe a bad work ethic. Which is such a lie because I always went above and beyond for that lousy café and gave it my all.

Some times I regret not coming in, then I could’ve taken her to court but let’s not dwell in the past.

Hi everyone!

I just needed some advice, I had some concerns.

I recently had an interview at a pretty high end sushi restaurant and I am scheduled to train with them next week as a server.

The manager who interviewed me told me that they all pool tips. In the beginning as I train, I will not make any (I understand). But once I am scheduled proper work shifts and finish training she said that once all tips are collected, I would receive a share of 70%. So if there is a $100, I'd receive $70. Over time I will qualify to earn more percentage of tips. It is a pretty expensive establishment. She said an average night I should expect $100, busier nights more possibly. I should have asked more questions during the interview, but I don't know why I didn't. I feel like I would sound like a fool if I called and asked, even though she did say that I could call if I have any questions.

Is it common to pool tips in sushi and Japanese restaurants? I come from a different background and work mostly in bars (no food), although I have worked in restaurants before.",0,Anyone have experience with sushi restaurants?,7

So I've been at this game for a while and my experience with a lady last night is definitely on my wall of fame. I didnt know whether to feel bad because she actually seemed mentally unwell. Anyway, she came in and asked for a table for two outside, mind you the sun is down and its in the 40s, I greet her and get her drink order. Then I take her food order and as she goes to hand me the two menus back, she looks to the empty seat and asks ""and for you?"" I looked at her a little confused and she just laughed. Weird but whatever. Then, as I am walking back inside, she yells ""Excuse me!"" and asks for a straw. Sure thing, I turn back around and hear ""Excuse me!"" She wants another tea. Yes maam. i Turn back around and get the third ""Excuse me!"". She needs another water. By the time I make the drinks, I turned around and she was moving inside because it was ""cold out there"". Less walking for me, cool. Except she left all her drinks and whatnot outside. I ran out and grabbed them for her and put the plate across from her and she stops me and asks me to move it slightly to the right, directly across from her. Then it starts to escalate very quickly.

She set the extra drinks up in a place setting and when the food came, she put a slice of pizza on the plate and started reading aloud from a journal she had been writing in. Its not the first time I have seen people do stuff like this but the talking to the empty seat was a little weird. She ate her slice and then the other slice off the plate opposite her and then asked me to remove the extra setting, one item at a time. She then got up walked to the bathroom, and stopped me to ask me if it was in fact the bathroom. She was probably in there for close to ten minutes before she came out and walked up to our expo and told him the bathroom needed cleaning. This lady had taken all of the cleaning supplies, trashcans, plungers etc. out of the bathroom stalls and placed them in the hallway blocking the bathroom door. She went as far as emptying the trash and placing the full bag in the hallway. Oh and then filled an entire toilet full of toilet paper. Wtf.

At this point, I dropped off the check and a box for her while she aimlessly wandering around the restaurant chatting people up. She cornered a coworker and told him about her future husband, Jesus, and her poetry and so on. And then I see her walk over to our expo window which has garnishing herbs and cheese out, cough all over it and then pick up a big block of parmesan cheese and a grater and start going to town grating it right on to the floor. I ran over and told her she needed to stop because it was a health code violation, and she had just touched everything in the bathroom, and she said ""oh"" and handed me the cheese that I promptly threw away. She then started playing in the container of chopped basil. I did my best patient server voice and again told her she needed to stop and get away from the window and she asked me why all this stuff was there then. I explained it was a healthcode issue and I now had to throw the whole container away and she responded ""oh, well then throw it away"" and stuck her hand in every other herb there and walk away. She continued wandering around the restaurant touching everything and tried to wander behind the bar. After harassing the kitchen staff for a while she finally did a lap and said goodbye to everyone and I server mode kicked in because I knew she hadnt paid her bill yet.

She packs up her stuff and stands up and starts walking toward our side door. I ran over and grabbed the check, chasing after calling loudly for her. She made it out the door and a couple steps away when she turned around and acknowledged me and I asked her to please come back in and pay for her food. This lady turns around, walks back inside and slowly walks across the entire restaurant and out the front door, while I'm walking right behind her. She walked about halfway down the patio while I was following and calling her before I finally lost it and yelled ""Ma'am, I know you can hear me!"". She turned around and said ""Wow you're so patient"". Trying not to fully loose it, I got her back inside and paid. What. The. Fuck.

I am a Host at a local restaurant in my hometown. I typically work Saturday nights and Sunday mornings (as I'm attending/living at college an hour away and it just makes things easier for me and the other hosts). 

It was a Sunday morning shift (We open at 11 am) and some regulars come in. It is a man with (usually) both of his parents who are disabled or they both just have a hard time walking on their own. (The son is about 50-55 and his parents are in their late 70s). 

The son and the Dad come in, and the Mom wasn't there for some reason (I honestly don't remember why). They eat their food and they are ALWAYS smart asses, but overall nice people to serve and deal with as Sunday mornings suck. 

They finish their food and the son is carrying multiple To-go boxes and is struggling (for some reason he hates the To-go bags?) So, the Dad had already started walking towards the door with his cane. Seeing the son struggling, I open the door for the Dad. He smiles at me and thanks me. His son thanks me and gets into his car to place the food down (he was going to be coming back for his Dad btw). There is a little bit of a step down to get to his car so I just helped the Dad down and opened the door to his car to help him out. 

The Dad stopped in his tracks and said, ""You know, out of all the years I have been going to restaurants you're the only one who has gone above and beyond to help me out."" 

I was a little shocked. All I did was open the door and help him into his car because him and his son were struggling in that moment. 

I kindly told him it was no problem and closed the car door behind him. The son thanked me again and I went inside to continue working. 

I'm not gonna lie, I had a pep in my step for the rest of the shift. ",0,Old Man Makes My Day,83

so my question is, would you give her perfect service, or save your attention for tables that are actually going to tip? i’ve done both and it doesn’t affect her lOvElY attitude or her lack of tipping. in a perfect world i’d ask why she always comes back when all she does is waste her server’s time.

A husband and wife in their 60s sit down. I give them some time (3-4 minutes) with the menu and approach their table. “Hello -“ I say, barely, before the woman interrupts me with “I almost left! I didn’t think there was service here.” I apologize profusely. She asks for a wine recommendation. I bring her two tasters and she’s very happy with my suggestions, they order a bottle. They order the lowest calorie appy because “I’m on a very strict calorie counting diet, darling.” She asks if she’ll be able to share the appy with her husband AND have a salad after. I tell her that the appy is very light - sautéed veg and peanuts in a chili oil sauce with a lettuce head on the side to wrap the contents. There should be no issue eating a salad after that. 

Appy hits the table. I check in 1 minute later, and she says to me, “Cancel my salad. There is literally no way I could eat a salad after this giant appetizer.” She’s had two bites of lettuce. Maybe the fact that she’s had almost half a bottle of wine is at play here. I cancel the salad. I come back to tell her, and ask how everything is.

Here’s the kicker. She says to me:

“I don’t come here often, and always forget how fantastic the food is. But my biggest issue with this place is how bad the service is.”

I’m almost speechless, I simply say “thank you for your feedback I’m happy to pass that on to the manager.” She nods knowingly. 

Bill time comes. Her silent and apologetic-looking husband makes small talk with me as she tips me 10% - I was expecting 0%, so I’m glad that at least I don’t have to pay to tip out on their $100 meal. 

ANOTHER twist - bear with me guys - half an hour after they leave, the husband comes back. I run up to him thinking “shit god damn it fuck what did I do.”

He reaches for my hand and says to me, “my wife was being very cranky this evening and I was so impressed that you were unwavering in your kindness and professionalism. I want to apologize her her behavior and emphasize that you were fantastic. Thank you.” 

He puts a $20 in my hand and walks away. Most surprising turnaround, and a 10% tip turned into a 30%. Could not believe my ears and almost started crying. Good people do exist!

So he’s taking a families takeout order and at first all is well. The father and kids put in their orders like normal people. When it gets to the wife she starts asking a lot of questions. From here on out I’ll call her Deep Fried Crazy Lady or DFCL for short. 

My friend: what can I get for you?

DFCL: what kind of chicken do you have?

Friend: we have platters with grilled chicken or fried chicken. 

DFCL: well I need the healthy option but not the normal way. 

Friend: okay no problem, how would you like it?

DFCL: I want fried grilled chicken with the fried on the side. 

Friend: um I’m sorry but I don’t understand what you mean

DFCL: (getting irritated very quickly) I want the grilled chicken but fried. 

Friend: oh okay, you’d like us to deep fry the chicken breast?

DFCL: yes but with the fried in the side!

Friend: do you mean with fries in the side?...

DFCL: no! I mean with the fried part on the side!

Friend: ma’am I’m not quite sure how our cook would do that.  

This goes on for awhile with my friend offering to do the chicken sautéed but she kept insisting she wanted “fried grilled chicken with the fried on the side.” Finally he realized that she was asking him to stick a grilled chicken breast in the fryer with nothing on it and to put the breadcrumbs on the side. He consulted the cook to see if that could be done, and got hysterical laughter from all the kitchen staff as his response. He went back and told the woman he could not do that. She refused to order anything else and asked to speak to a manager, at which point he had to awkwardly explain that he was the manager.

They are not outright rude, just short.  I get them their drinks and go to take their order.  He asks me, ""your porkchop is a tomahawk, right?  With the long bone?"" I reply ""Yes!  It's delicious."" 

Fast forward to when their food comes out.  For some awful reason, his doesn't have the bone sticking out.  Of course.  He calls me over and points this out to me.  I've never seen our porkchop come out with no bone like that before, and I told him as such.  I inquire with the chef, and he said that it's the same cut of meat and our new sous hadn't trimmed the meat down all the way and that the bone is still there, and I guess technically the guy is getting more meat.  Alright then.  I go to tell the man what the chef told me, and he goes ""Well I don't know if I believe that.""  Guy is sitting with his arms crossed and still hasn't taken a bite.  

At this point, I decide to get my manager involved who checks with the chef, goes out and tells the man the same thing I told him.  I didn't hear what else my manager said, but I think he said someone along the lines of ""well I hope you like the taste of it at least."" My manager comes back and says the guy doesn't want anything else, so I figured the matter was over.

While he didn't really make a scene in the restaurant, this guy FLIPPED over social media.  He wrote a FIVE PARAGRAPH review about what a ""proper"" tomahawk is, posted it on yelp, google reviews, facebook AND emailed the company.  He even copied a review that someone else had posted, with the picture of our tomahawk, and said ""it looks like (restaurant) DOES know what a tomahawk is"" A week later, he uploads a picture of his boyfriend chewing on a tomahawk bone in another restaurant, making it our cover photo on yelp.  Lovely.

The situation made me angry on many different levels.  One, I looked like an idiot because he SPECIFICALLY asked me if it was tomahawk, and I said yes.  Two, while I understand that this guy didn't get what he wanted, he is literally just upset he didn't have the bone sticking off of his plate.  It was still the same cut of meat and it still had a bone (albeit smaller) Three, I wish I had spoken up to my manager because I thought he would take care of it, and he didn't, although if we had gotten him another porkchop it's likely it would have been prepared the same way anyway.

To set the stage, I currently work for a bagel shop with multiple locations throughout the states.  I initially started out as a seasonal worker, doing mostly summers between college semesters.  I graduated with my bachelors in music business in 2017, and after deciding starting close to home would be the wisest decision.  Unfortunately and understandably, jobs within my field that offered opportunity for advancement and networking aren’t that plentiful in upstate New York.  I returned to the store as a “full time employee” (I could go on about how liberally this term is used at my store now, but that’s a story in of itself).  Working in food service, less and less shit actually ends up surprising you.  Still, there’s always that one customer who somehow finds a way.  That being said, let’s get into it.

The first encounter happened on my day off, so I relied on a coworker/friend to fill in the blanks.  It was the morning shift, and the crew was busy.  Being located close to the express way towards the downtown area of my city, people will come to grab half dozens and full, sometimes multiple dozens for the office every day.  On top of that, we also have a drive through, so there isn’t exactly a lack of work to be doing.  On this morning, my general manager (GM from here) was running the DT, and up pulls the star of this story (we’ll him Mad Man or MM).  He was your typical dress-shirt-wearing, middle aged man.  He had ordered a sandwich and some additional bagels; okay. GM begins to cash MM out.  

We’re in the middle of a rush so it takes about 5 minutes to get his stuff out.  After slowly going through the contents of his order, he knocks on the window.  “Got the sandwich wrong, try it again.”   GM isn’t the type to let someone walk over her, but she smiles, says she’ll be back, and goes to make the sandwich herself.  There was nothing wrong with it, but she makes a new one from scratch, returns to the window, apologizes as she gives MM the food, and begins to close the window.  He’s already shaking his head.  “Again?  Really?  It’s just a salmon sandwich with mayo.  Do it again.”  At this point, GM realizes what she’s dealing with.  “Sir, I assure you that this is what you ordered.  I made the sandwich myself, and we have a line behind you.  If you’d like to come inside and have someone make it in front of you, we’d be happy to oblige.  I am going to need you to pull around though.”  MM replies in an overly-combative tone, “Are you serious? I come here every week, and this happens.  This is unacceptable!  Just remake it!”  **For full context, this was the first time ANYONE recalls seeing him at the store**
GM is half- dumbfounded, half-irritated, but doesn’t break character, and goes to make the sandwich.  Again.  As she shuts the window, she hears MM mutter “Guess they’ll just hire anyone as a manger.”  Take three, and he’s more indignant than ever.  I don’t feel comfortable repeating what was allegedly said here, but there was apparently a good sprinkling of a word beginning with the letter, R thrown in.  Before he can really lay into her, GM calmly but firmly cuts him off.  “Sir, you’ve been here for 8 minutes.  There are 10 people behind you, and I have a store to run.  I can comp your meal today, but regardless of whether I or anyone else on my staff is making your sandwich, I will not allow you to speak to anyone here like this.  I’m afraid I will have to ask you to take your business elsewhere in the future.”   MM looks like a balding tomato at this point. “WHATS YOUR NAME?”  GM gives him her name.  “This is the worst service I’ve ever received.  I didn’t want to do this, but you’ve left me no choice!”  MM takes his food, and FINALLY speeds off.
A half hour later, a cop car rolls into the parking lot.  A male officer gets out, walks into the store, and asks to speak to GM.  Guys, MM actually called the cops on the store for “verbal harassment and intimidation”.

Long story short, GM explained her end of the story, and the cop laughs, rolling his eyes.  He assures her that he believes her account, and that this isn’t the first time this subhuman has made a report like this.  He gets back into his car, drives off, and the rest is history.  The crazy thing is that MM ACTUALLY HAD THE GAUL TO COME BACK, this time while I was working.  That is another story, but this is long as is.  If you guys want, I’ll share that another time.

Not sure if it fits here exactly since I'm not a server/staff in the restaurant but I saw this happened as a customer.

It happened in a local fast food restaurant that was close to a university.

My SO and I were eating our lunch on a table just a few feet from the cashier. We suddenly heard a woman raise her voice, then shouting. Like really loud shouting.

She was so loud that I'm sure everyone in that floor of the restaurant could hear her (not just us who were near the cashier).

There was a general ruckus/freak-out scene but I can't remember what the exchange was exactly except for some insults directed at the cashier like “You are really dumb, aren’t you?”. Just before the woman (and her friend/sister) stormed out of the restaurant, she shouted something like ""You are all useless. We no longer care about the food, you wasted our time. Take the food and shove it up yours."" (translated from our language)

After the commotion, I overheard the other restaurant staff talking to the cashier about what happened.

Turns out that the woman presented a receipt that was dated for a previous day (the cashier said the receipt was “old”), but she claimed that she ordered minutes ago and had already been waiting for quite a while to be called by the cashier. I guess the cashier wasn’t having it and so the freak-out ensued.

The way she talked to that cashier, goddamn. The restaurant employs students to work part-time and I’m pretty sure that the cashier was a student. The cashier is a 4’10”, 40+ lbs. teen who just took insults left and right, from this rotund, middle-aged woman, like a champ. She went on to take orders from customers like nothing happened. Completely smiling and all.

Now to give the woman the benefit of the doubt, it may just be that she did have the wrong receipt (I guess that could happen?) and that she was just not able to produce the correct one (if there were one at all). Also the fact that this restaurant is super busy (especially during lunch time), I guess lapses like this do happen. OR she could have been trying to get free food and was shut down because she didn’t know receipts have dates on them. ",0,Freak-out over fast food,11

This happened a few months ago but I ran into an old coworker yesterday and he reminded me of this story and I thought it fit here.

I’ve worked in food service (FoH &amp; BoH) since I was 14 and I have my share of ridiculous/awful/sexist etc customers but this is one of the few that grossed me out so much that I took a shower as soon as I got home to physically wash the creepiness off of me.

Up until a few months ago I was working as a hostess in a small mom &amp; pop diner. The way the my job worked meant that in addition to seating customers and preparing take out orders, customers would come up to the host stand to pay for their meals as well. 

The day in question was relatively slow, and I was working the 12-close shift, and the incident took place around 3:30, in between the lunch rush and the early bird dinner rush. Most of our customers were regulars, and one of my favorite regulars, an older man named Andy, came in with another man (Willy) at his usual time, and I sat them in Andy’s favorite spot, a booth at the opposite end of the restaurant.

I’m on friendly terms with Andy so I make small talk with him while I seat him and Willy and bring them their drinks because their server was nowhere to be found (the degree of laziness of the servers here could be its own post). I list off some of our daily specials for Willy’s benefit, since they’re the same every week so Andy already knows them and when I finish, Willy gives me this unnerving smile that didn’t reach his eyes and said “those sound great, but are you sure you’re not on the menu?” 

Okay, gross but nothing I’m not used to, so I smile and laugh awkwardly before telling them that I’ll send their server right over. For the rest of their meal, every time I swing by their table, either to give them refills or bus their plates, Willy manages to make some awkward or sexual remark to me including “your skin looks like cream, I’ve always liked sweet Irish girls.” (I’m pale with freckles) 

By the end of their meal, I’m throughly grossed out by Willy and slightly disappointed in Andy for not saying anything to his friend, but it’s not that big of a deal. EXCEPT for when they come up to the host stand to pay. 

I split their check and Andy pays without incident, but when I give Willy his total and reach out to take his card he GRABS my hand and yanks my arm forward, forcing me to lean more than halfway over the counter. 

“I thought you said you had a fiancé?” (I don’t, but sometimes I lie and say I do when guys get too sexually aggressive towards me when I’m working) 

“I don’t see a ring on that lovely finger of yours, you weren’t lying to old Willy were you?” At this point he’s stroking my hand and my arm and I am choking back revulsion. Willy was easily 40 years my senior and at the time only had about half of his teeth. 

I managed to keep my game face on and told him I don’t wear my ring at work because I don’t want it to get damaged or lost, and I gently but firmly pull my hand out of his grasp so I can run his card. After I handed him his receipt, he managed to stroke my hand again and winked at me before he and Andy left. When I was closing out their tickets a few minutes, I saw that Willy had written down his phone number on his receipt with the note “for my delicious hostess” 

I’ve gotten a lot of gross comments while working FoH, but something about that interaction left me wanting to scrub the places on my arm where he touched me raw. And apparently, according to my coworkers, he came back on his own a few times after that when I wasn’t working and asked the servers and hosts what my last name was, what my schedule was, and if I lived in the area. Thankfully none of them told him and I left that job (for a number of reasons) a few weeks afterwards so I never had to interact with him again but now at my new job I’m a lot more conscious of my body and proximity to others when I’m interacting with customers.

&amp;#x200B;

They had a co-worker who one could only describe as old-school; he had a depression-era mentality about food waste, and would regularly eat cornbread that was on its way to the trash despite this establishment having it in endless supply and letting staff snack on it whenever they wanted anyhow.  This sets the stage for an incredible interaction with a customer who did not like the free snack that came with their oysters.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a Melville-like aside on marine biology:  [pea crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea_crab) are, as the name suggests, pea-sized crabs that often take up residence inside the mantle cavity (the mantle is the curtain-like outer part of the soft body of an oyster, responsible for depositing calcium on the shell and growing the shell) of oysters.  They are perfectly harmless, and their presence in an oyster is not an indication of the quality or freshness of an oyster, only an indication that oysters come from the ocean and that the ocean, like many dangerous and exciting things, has crabs.  The especially salty among us just eat the pea crabs when they find them, which is really no different from eating the oyster they're in except for a little crunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the tourists who frequent this restaurant are perfectly ignorant of all this, of course.  This is amateur hour all day every day - often this is their first raw bar.  You see where this is going: a customer gets a pea crab in their oyster and gets ready to call the health department, NASA, and the National Enquirer about the contamination.  Our server, ever the problem solver, simply looks at the plate of oysters, points to the crab, and asks, ""You don't want it?""  The customer replies in the extreme affirmative, and then he simply reaches in, picks it out, eats it on the spot, and walks away, assuming everyone has gotten what they wanted from the exchange.  

&amp;#x200B;

I further heard that he was eventually let go, not for this, but for taking home a bottle of wine every night for more years than you'd think you can do that.

This guy was well into his 50’s and replied by saying: “o man would I just love to take you home and cover you in garlic”. Gross. I gave a wtf face before another host took him to his table. I’ve been on the look out ever since then... When will some old men stop being so creepy!? Why can’t people just be normal out in public where boundaries and respecting others is important!

We dont have a computer system for seating so everything is done on paper. So even where the table assignments of where their sections are supposed to go is on paper. This is usually done by the morning host. Three weeks in a row one server has erased someone else's name and wrote her own name and stolen her section. It caused such an argument the last time this happened that I had to grab my manager and get it sorted out and it caused a line of about 30 or so people to form (I cant seat anyone until I know who is going where)

They blame me for a lot of things that are out of my control. Some sections are going to be less popular than others and may even vary depending on the day, they know this, that is why their sections rotate (duh). They accuse me of skipping them when seating people but within reason I have to seat people where they want (for example, our outdoor spots are generally more popular). They will come right up to me with attitude and make rude comments whether it's in front of customers or not. I have even seen them cuss each other out. 

Now most of them are not that bad but the ones that are, are really bad. I am not sure what to say to make them stop. The manager is aware of how they are since most of the servers have been there more than a decade or at least several years (we are somewhat upscale and they can take home 300-500 in tips a night so turnover is low) but we are union and at times it's hard to do anything about their behavior. I am super new, only been there a month, and I'm not assertive so I'm somewhat of an easy target for their childishness. To be honest, unless I'm at an extreme boiling point, I usually just freeze up if someone is being mean to me.

Before we were just a typical open at 11am until 2am  with a full bar, we're the local spot for late night party goers which is what I'm used to and only like to do, night cocktail serve.

I told them I didn't want anything to do with breakfast, which starts at 7am, not a morning person at all. They were cool with it. They actually hired a whole new staff just for breakfast cuz its an entire different breed of work. Especially since many of us refuse it and just want to stay nights. 

Well, they last minute remodified my schedule to work not only breakfast today, but also at night, a horrendous double. I haven't even been trained on breakfast they just threw me on. Couldn't get it covered, I knew it was gonna be a shit show for me and that's exactly what it was. 

We got BUSY. Were talking like as busy as it gets on a Friday night, but around 8am in the morning. Wtf. So I had to learn as I went. Barely know the breakfast menu or how to ring stuff in. There's a lot of modifications you have to type in for orders. GM was constantly yelling at me for ringing in stuff wrong and I'm like dude, I have NO training on this and this is actually against my availability so why am I even here? We also have to give out French press coffee to every table so getting drinks and shit takes longer than normal. It felt like I was working in an entire different restaurant.

Some of my tables understood. They would ask me questions I can't answer, so I would say, ""I'm sorry, this is my first breakfast shift and haven't been trained for it, they just threw me on. I'm mainly a night server but I'll go find out for you."" Some even felt real bad for me cuz they could tell how frustrated I was. Others though were impatient and annoyed. 

The other servers who've done breakfast were a big help but we got so busy they cant be on the spot to help. Because lunch also starts at 11am and breakfast is until 1pm so now you're getting people for both coming in. A total of almost 250 people I'm that 6am to 1pm time frame. It was chaotic.

Let me preface this by saying I made a post a bit ago about how busy south by southwest was. Psssh! I have never seen it so busy than it was today for brunch. I worked the bar section today which has about 12-15 tables.  Not that big a deal but, like most bar sections, it's open seating. When there is nowhere to sit in the main dining room, the hostess just tells people to sit in the bar.

 Have you ever been dodeca sat before? I don't even know if that's the right term cause I've never had to use it but that's what happened! The entire room went from having three people to every table being filled all at once, plus an 8 top in the back. I was by myself and was trying to get to people in the order I noticed them sit down. I've never had so many people waving me down, asking for coffee and just trying to get me to their table.

 One man in particular, waved me down about three times and I told him I'd be right with him. When I finally got to him to take his order, he didn't even know what he wanted! I was so frustrated and it definitely showed. He said I sounded 'nervous'. I told him I wasn't, that I'm just trying my best to help everyone and I could give him a couple more minutes to decide if he wanted. But instead he just wanted to NOT read the menu and ask if we had certain items. Benedict? Yessir, it's right here on the menu. Eggs? Yessir, here on the menu. Do you have oatmeal? Cue me screaming internally. Another woman said I seemed flustered when she asked for her latte a second time. All I had said in response was ""yes, I'm so sorry. It'll be right out""

So last night I had an 11-top, 4 top, and then got seated with a 2 top. 

Definitely not the busiest I've been but my 11 was somewhat needy so I did have to give them a lot of attention and was somewhat flustered. My 4 top was standard, nice people, not very chatty, didn't need much. Then I get this lovely little two top, a dad and his super sweet daughter. Honestly I kind of needed them because I needed a bit of pep.

The daughter was soooo sweet, super shy but was admiring my very bright pink hair, so I told her that it was a shampoo and she could get it at our local beauty supply. I emphasize, super nice table. So imagine my surprise when I get their ticket (I had been a bit busy closing out the 4 tickets on my 11 and trusted the 2 top would pay) and he had left only $21 on a $31.xx ticket. When they got up, I had seen them putting cash down and even in the middle of being busy I asked them if they'd like me to grab them change, he said no so now I know why.

I was pretty disappointed, but whatever, not the first time this has happened to me, I just asked my manager to comp off some of the ticket so I could at least not lose the whole $10. I honestly couldn't believe they would do that at first, looked my whole section and walk for the $10 I must have dropped, tried to reason that he must have read it as 21, (but that would still have stiffed even the change) but our tickets are definitely concise and the total check is decently large on the receipt.

It was an average Sunday at work. I was swiping people in, and since it was the day before the meal swipes reset for the week, a lot of people had to pay with the university's version of currency, cash or card. Then, at about half an hour before my shift ends, YB walked in and gave me his ID to swipe him in for his meal. He was out of meal swipes, so the following conversation took place:


Me: I'm sorry, but you're out of meal swipes. Would you like to pay with cash, card, or university bucks?

YB: Aight, university bucks.


So I complete the transaction (about $7.50), and as the machine was printing the receipt, he got a mad look on his face as he looks at the display on the opposite side of the register.

This one lady, all very dressed up in her period costume, was annoyed at the line situation and projected it onto me and was complaining. You could tell it was a really special thing for her.

There were no receipts, no tickets, no cash registers. Just cash tils and pure chaos with us shouting the orders into the kitchen windows.

And then the lines would dissolve into a mob of people pretty frequently.

So after complaining at me, the lady goes up to the cashier guy right next to me and says ""I like you a lot better."" I guess because he really sucked up to her to get her to calm down.

I’m working away with my coworker on a busy Saturday, making lots of smoothies and serving a bunch of little treats (cookies, muffins, etc.) We have a bit of a lull after the lunch rush, and my coworker goes to the back to do some dishes. Then in walk two ladies in their 60s. 

They order without incident (though they do ask an excessive number of questions). I make both of their smoothies and grab the chocolate bites they ordered and pop them into a paper bag. 

As I’m cashing them out I mention that they can grab straws for their smoothies on their side of the counter. That’s when one of the ladies launches into a tirade about how plastic straws are horrible for the environment and that I should be ashamed of myself to be providing their smoothies in plastic cups with plastic straws. I agreed with her that plastic wasn’t the most environmentally friendly option, but that unfortunately I didn’t have a say in the types of cups and straws we stocked. I mentioned that we happily pour smoothies into jars or tumblers brought in by customers, and that we even give a discount for it, but she wasn’t listening. Just going on and on. Meanwhile her friend is saying nothing. 

Finally she stops educating me on the dangers of plastic and goes with her friend to sit outside. I think that interaction is over with, and tell my coworker all about it when she comes back to the front. 

Fast forward to 15 minutes later, when she comes back inside and asks me if I have plastic wrap. 

Me, confused and cautious: ”Pastic wrap?”

Plastic Lady, impatiently: “Yes. Plastic wrap.”

Me, still cautious: “I believe we do have some in the kitchen, yes.”

Plastic Lady, imperiously: “Well I’m going to need you to go get some.”

Me, confused: “May I ask why?”

Plastic Lady, even more impatiently: “This paper bag you gave me to hold these chocolate bites is getting oily. There’s no way I could put it in my purse like this. I need these bites individually wrapped in plastic and put into a new paper bag.”

Me, in shock: “... Um... Ok, yes. You want me to use MORE plastic. Right, let me take that from you.”

I go ahead and do what she asked, barely biting my tongue. When I’m finished I hand her the new bag. 

Me, in my friendliest customer service voice: “Here you go. Two bites individually wrapped in plastic in a new paper bag, as requested.”

Plastic Lady, rudely: “It’s about time.” 

They leave. 

My coworker and I burst out laughing. 

I think about this lady’s hypocrisy often and smile.

Red Bull was really picking up steam at this point though. I was working at a mid level chain restaurant. Picture a steakhouse that is a step above your typical TGI Bennigardenbees. We had a patio with 10 two top tables that could not be moved, so it was kinda limited in use. We only used it for private events and busy weekend nights. I loved working the private events and could upsell extremely well, so management loved to have me work those events. Needless to say, I was pretty stoked to see someone booked 6 consecutive Monday nights for private events since typically I'd make 100-150 off those parties and it was an easy in and out shift.

I show up the first Monday and meet sales douchebag guy(DB). Right away I knew this was gonna be bad just by the way he started talking to me. ""Hey, boss! So you're gonna be my right hand man for then next six weeks I hear?"" Then proceeds to hand me menus that he made himself that drastically limits our menu down to all the lesser priced items, but he wants me to pass them out as if they were coming from the restaurant. Not too big a deal, we've done stuff like this in the past for large groups. Then he proceeds to tell me that he only wants me in the patio twice. Once to take the orders, then once to pass out the food and then disappear. No refills, no anything else. It seems really odd, but ok, that's cool I guess cause it's less work for me. The first night goes off smoothly from my end and I'm wondering what exactly is going on out there. People come out looking either excited or a little confused and it's just really a weird dynamic as they all trickle out of the restaurant. I bring out the bill and this is where DB drops a bomb on me. He pays the tab and tells me that if I do a great job all six weeks just like that night, he'll tip me really well at the end. I do not like this. I do not like this at all. Typically anyone that says they will tip you well does not tip really well. Its what we refer to in the industry as a ""verbal tip"". 

3 of these weeks go by and everything goes off without a hitch, but I finally get a chance to talk to one of the guests. Turns out he is doing hard sales pitches to distributors, entrepreneurs, and anyone else who might buy 5 Hour Energy in bulk. Yup, 5 Hour Energy is an MLM gimmick that people bought right into and many many people are rich because people are/were dumb enough to buy a tiny bottle of stuff with caffeine in it for like 3 bucks.

So anyway, jump to the end of the 6 week stint and DB finally tips me. Now mind you that each night's food totals were roughly 20 people x 20 dollars. So about 4-500/night. Which at the low end of tipping is 60/night, so 360 for 6 nights would be acceptable, but low. The guy pays the final bill and takes a crisp 100 dollar bill out of his pocket and hands it to me like he's making me a fucking millionaire with his amazingly gracious tip. I literally didn't say a word and just walked away biting my tongue not to call the guy out on all the levels of douchebaggery that he represents. 

So, not really that great a story overall, but I just kinda wanted to vent and let you know the type of people who got rich off that 5 hour energy drink garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Germany and during my summer break from university I worked in a small, old cinema in a small town. I mostly worked the snack station in the front (aka I prepare your snacks, sold the tickets, took reservations, cleaned and made sure everything was stocked) but most of our drinks were served inside the rooms. You would go to your seat, press a button and one of us would scurry to your seats and take your drink orders and prepare them at the bar in the back. So you got your drinks in actual glasses with ice, if you were 18+ you could actually get alcoholic berverages.

We did not have a soda fountain and we did not have big papercups to pour drinks into. The usual serving size was 0.33 litre for soda. There were no smaller or bigger sizes. The most popular popcorn flavour in Germany is also sweet. Not caramel, just sweet. Salty popcorn can usually only be found in big chain cinemas in big cities.

&amp;#x200B;

One day a man (a regular I had seen plenty of times before), his wife and a random woman wearing a bald eagle shirt which I don't recognise walk in. I greet them, sell them tickets and since it was a slow day (we would fight over who got to do the next task because we were bored af) my colleague was eager to handle the sale of snacks while I took reservations for that evening. I'm not paying attention to my colleague until I hear someone yell in English: ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY CAN'T SELL ME A BIGGER SODA?!""  
The regular tries talking to the woman I didn't know in English to the best of his abilities and my colleague motions for me to help.   
Putting on my best smile, I walk over and ask in German and English whether I can be of any help. The woman (henceforth we shall refer to her as AW) turns and continues yelling at me how she wants a gallon\* of coke. I tell her that we only offer this one serving size but she is free to order multiple of those throughout the movie. She goes off on a little rant about how stingy Germans are with soda which I ignore because I get it. It's weird being in a foreign country and adjusting to everything around you. No need to be an ass but whatever.  
My colleague has NOPED out at this point. She's disappeared into the back and I can't blame her because that poor girl had only started working there two days earlier.  
It's at this point that the regular already starts profusely apologising. AW is some very distant relative who got in touch with them when she discovered she still had relatives in Germany and because they seemed to get along they decided to host her for a while and show her around the area some common ancestors had originated from. I tell him it's fine and him and his wife should just get to their seats. I literally tell him that I got this.

I return to take her order. She wants salted popcorn. We do not have salted popcorn and I say as much. She asks me why and I tell her that it's just not as popular in Germany hence we don't make it.

""Then go make some.""

I explain to her why that is not possible (we only have one machine which would have to be cleaned in order to make salted popcorn. For which we also lack supplies etc.).

AW is not having it. She keeps going on and on and on about how Germans are stingy and weird. How we clearly have no taste in food (to her defense: the area this cinema was in and that I am also from is not known for its amazing cuisine.). Of course, I'm getting annoyed but when dealing with customers you have to have that unwavering smile plastered on your face and just silently swear in your mind.

She eventually settles for nachos with cheese (not without complaining about or ""tiny"" serving sizes) and gets to her seat where she proceeds to order a coke. Surprise, surprise: She only ordered one bottle of coke. Guess the 0.33 l were enough after all.  
Accoring to my colleague who served her drink she made it a point to tell her that she would not be tipping. Bohoo. We get paid 8€ minimum wage per hour and don't have to rely on tips for survival. Anyone who works full-time earns more than that. You only tip if you think the service was good and you can afford to do that.

During the pre-movie ads the regular comes out again and continues apologising. Again, my colleague and I tell him it's fine and that we're sorry he has to deal with her more frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

On the way out AW stopped by the snack station again to tell me that she would not tip (Bummer. I'm about to cry, lady.) and America is the best (she didn't say that word for word but I don't recall her 5 minute speech on the matter). 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to throw this out there before someone jumps to the conclusion: I know that not all Americans are like that. I've had plenty of good encounters during my various part-time jobs in university. She just sticks out like a sore thumb alongside the guy who complained about his beer not tasting like Bud Light and wanting a refund (he didn't order Bud Light because we don't sell that.) or the lady thinking that a manager will automatically give her stuff for free.

&amp;#x200B;

\* A question about the gallon of coke: Was she just making that serving size up? Because that would be 3 litres of coke and I am worried because that's a lot.

I work at an independent seaside amusement park to help fund my living expenses at university, today I was on the dodgems (aka bumper cars) training a new guy. We were doing it for about 4 hours or so without any real issues or bad customers. 

About 3pm it starts to get a little busy, which isn't a problem for two people as it's usually only the one person up there regardless of how busy it gets. We have a load of young teens come on as well as a father, mother, and their child - they all get in separate dodgem cars. All is well for about 2 minutes, then then the father and child get stuck on the barrier side (it goes child's car -&gt; fathers car -&gt; barrier, so the kid's car is what's trapping them). Neither of them can move, the cars are working regardless because I can see the sparks come off the metal grate above their heads and as the reflection of sparks underneath the car off the metal floor. I shout (I have to shout bc it's very loud when it's going) at the child to ""turn the wheel"" and motion as such, which is the solution to 9/10 problems we encounter, especially as I could see the kid wasn't turning it. The father starts getting angry, rapidly flaring his arms and shouting ""he fking is"" (I can see he clearly isn't), and shouting ""it's not fking working"". 

I stop the ride at this point as I realise it's easier to just pull the cars out than have to keep shouting or have to deal with a complaint. While I do this the father is still shouting profanities and what not after pulling them both out. I start the ride up again, and the kid's car isn't moving. The father then really loses his rag, almost screeching in anger, shouting real profanities. 

The issue now is the kid isn't pressing the pedal to move the dodgem, I can see this clear as daylight and shout over ""he's got to press the pedal"", the dad shouts back ""he fking is"" (he's clearly not because I can see his knees pointed up and kids' knees have to be straight to reach and then press the pedal). At this point I turn the ride off again so I can go over and reassure the child on how to operate the dodgem car, the dad has none of it, gets out of the car, drags his child off, and the mother gets out and leaves looking very embarrassed. 

This all happens while my coworker is standing there behind the operator desk with a ""what the fk is going on"" expression, I kinda feel bad for him as it's literally his first shift here and he's already had to deal with a random going apeshit. As well as feeling bad for the other customers who just wanted to enjoy the ride without it stopping several times and having to watch me deal with someone losing their shit.

I know it’s terrible but to be fair, I only was going 5 over the limit at this time (50 in a 45). Anyways, the road is clear and I’m about to make it to the light when a white dirty van pulls out of a nearby community complex into the lane next to me.

As it’s happening I’m thinking well shiz something is wrong with my car so I roll my window down to talk to him.

At this point I’m now thinking well shiz this dude is an undercover creepy cop trying to give me a heads up (this ends up not being the case as the inside of the van doesn’t look very copish).

This conversation takes maybe 10 seconds and the light turns green and I continue. I’m a little frazzled by this encounter but go to work brushing it off. 

Couple of hours into my shift I notice a dude by the bar booths waving and giving me strange eye contact as I’m greeting my table. I of course ignore this because I’m in front of guests and I’m not going to interrupt their service for some random dude. I end up forgetting about the guy and finish my tables up only to have a coworker tell me that his table wants to talk to me. My coworker does this in close proximity to the table so I can’t play it off and walk away. 

I approach the table and they guy immediately is like “hey! Do you remember me?!” and I have no clue who this dude is until he tells me that’s he’s the same guy who was giving me a hard time on the road earlier. I don’t recognize him right away because the whole ordeal was seconds and so strange I didn’t take time to remember him. Anyways, he goes on to tell me how cute I am and how he noticed me right away (this dude is well into his 50’s so I feel uncomfortable with the conversation for multiple reasons).  Me being a friendly and an awkward person, I continues to talk to this dude and inch away from the table. He then tries to set me up with his son and proceeds to ask if I have a boyfriend and if my boyfriend is “big”. I tell him yes I do have a bf but he just continues to ask if he’s “big” like his son and how I should really give his son a chance. Poor kid is red and so embarrassed and eventually I’m able to end the conversation by changing the subject to college. The van dude doesn’t like how we’re done talking about me and his son so I’m able to get away shortly after. 

Weird experience and by far the strangest that has happened to me so far! 

TLDR: creepy van dude tells me that I’m a speedster and ends up hours later at the restaurant I work at and tries to set me up with his son.",0,A Strange Story!,11
897,novacandy,0,t3_b77k8j,28,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b77k8j/dont_ever_do_tip_pool_another_week_of_me_getting/,"I work at a casual restaurant as a bartender. Average check for two people ranges from $80 to $100. We do tip pool, and also have a tip out of 5.5% on total sales including tax. No idea where this money goes because we have one support staff for weekends.

Last Saturday I worked a double that included a party of 30 during the day (served them alone, while still being the only bartender for the entire restaurant). My end of the night cashout was: sales $5152; total tips $930; tip out $262; meaning $667 went into the pool. 

I ended up getting $395 that day. 

My tips were double, triple, or quadruple any of the other servers that day. One server put $350 in the pool, the rest were all $200 or less. 

Cue me asking the owner for clarification because I have no idea how this is possible. 

He starts freaking out at me. Saying he put the support on pool for a few hours, and his assistant on pool for a few hours. We had a BOH come in and help out with taking tables from 2-4pm, but they put him on pool for 1-5pm. As soon as it was 4pm he was off the floor, no help with end of shift duties or anything. 

The support staff and assistant rolled cutlery, helped with clearing tables (you have to tell them and direct them to which table) and seat guests with menus. They didn't even help me with clearing and resetting the second floor after the party. The first evening server came in and helped me with that. 

They literally did what they are paid and tipped out for. But for some reason they are being put on pool making the same as a server for a portion of their shift? 

Fuck that. ",0,Don't ever do tip pool. Another week of me getting screwed over.,112
898,maybe-drunk,0,t3_b78zgg,7,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b78zgg/i_jinxed_myself/,"Last week, one of the local high schools did a thing and there were 50 or so kids in the back room until midnight, a planned thing, so the servers who worked in that room that we usually close after 9, stayed and took care of it. It was a lot, and loud and the air was heavy with teenage sweat and angst and fried food. I thanked my lucky stars I was in the main dining room and don't have to deal with huge parties. For the record, they had 2 great servers, an added 17% autograt and the kitchen cranked shit out perfect. 


Tonight was slow., as I'm finishing up my dining room, I usually stay late and move over to the bar side, TRYING to grab a quick smoke, I get told I have a table. I have 2 tables, and one is my husband! Yay. And then I get seated again. And again. And dining room is filling up.. but then I notice my manager in the back room pulling tables together. 


My husband tells me, oh hey, I was talking to our neighbor, the school put on a play tonight, you're about to get busy. Crap.  Like 100 teenagers pile in. No joke. I am so lucky I am dealing with my few tables in the dining room still. I tell my tables I want to get their orders in quick before the party.. oh, wait. These are their parents. Ok. 


So now there are literally 100 teenagers in the back, I have a few other tables just trying to live, and then parents, who keep joining my parent table. 2 servers are staying late to do the party, not my prob.. until it is. I got asked to pick up 2 booths. There are at least 6 kids at each booth meant to seat 4. Chairs everywhere, people squashed in everywhere. 


Ok, I can handle 2 more tables. Holy crap, these kids are on some kinda theater high or maybe meth, idk. Trying to take one order is 36 voices coming at me at once. ""I'll have a fr.. I love your earrings.. no sit next to me.. I'm with her.. my sister is somewhere over there and gluten free please put her on my check"" .. I had to just stop and look at them multiple times because I had told them this can only work one at a time. 


So I've got my manager on milkshake duty because everyone wants milkshakes, not just my tables, but everyone's. Luckily teenagers want mostly burgers and chicken strips. My 2 tables are fine.


Then this long table I have to pass by has been forgotten, and keeps asking to order. My tables' food is out, so ok. I'm already in this. I take half the table, then the other half. Everything is fine, everyone is happy.


I have about 25-30 people. Normally, I'd split it by person, but my new place doesn't have the option of entering by seats. When the first few people ask for their checks, I split theirs off and shit is fine. Until I have my manager breathing down my back to split it up all at once, kids throwing cash at me and saying they don't need change, people paying for each other, my husband just chilling in the dining room watching the show, enjoying his burger, ha!


Finally,  to get things straight, my manager had to add a few drinks and such to checks, when the drinks were on a different table and couldn't be combined. So I got bitched out for having people not pay when we literally added those new items to make up for the ""not paid"" ones, if that makes sense. And then I got called out for taking that big table, that nobody had even greeted, because nobody told me to take it. Sorry for helping. If I didn't take it, they might still be there tomorrow night waiting.


Oh, and I totally forgot about the parent table in the main dining room, although they tipped me well. The kids were all decent.


I guess the moral to my rant is.. Never be too happy it isn't you, because next time, it might be you, and double worse! And I have cool earrings.

Yesterday I served a table. I’ve been in the industry for a long while and this particular table really blew me away. Reservation was a 6 top, 3 guests present as I approached the table and offered water. The host immediately asked for a bottle of Opus One. Fair enough, we usually carry that wine, though it is quite expensive. I also sold the last bottle 3 days before but i immediately agreed and told the guest i would bring the bottle ($650 pre tax cost, btw). My manager went to get the bottle and the guest was happy.... for a few minutes. 
    Presented the bottle, opened and poured a taste. The guest asked me to “pour the whole fucking bottle” in his glass. The Barolo glasses we stock don’t fit an entire bottle. So he let his friends have a few ounces and poured the rest in his wine glass. Fast forward about an hour and he can’t finish the big boy glass of wine he poured, so he asks to have the wine to go. My back-waiter had thrown the bottle away, so I chose a different bottle to pour it back into. All should be good...
But then the guest ordered 9 shots of Johnny Blue for his table and his neighboring table.... for 675 bucks. Sure no prob, I bring them to the table and get an order for a triple espresso, which I serve and then immediately serve another triple espresso to the same guy.
I ran to put the check down just In case his heart exploded and he couldn’t pay the bill.
And then, he tipped 30% in cash an that’s the end of the story ",0,The best this week!!,35
901,randallflaggg,0,t3_b78awx,5,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b78awx/i_just_finished_my_last_service/,"Hey everyone. I have been a lurker and very occasional commenter here for the decade that I have been in the restaurant industry. Next Monday I begin a new career in sales at a pretty decent sized tech company. 

I am someone who has only worked professionally in the restaurant industry. I moved to city soon after college and was a delivery boy, dishwasher, food runner, bar back, bartender, server, assistant manager, and GM over the course of my career. I am changing industries because I got married and a daytime schedule is more conducive to our future plans. It's a good job and a good opportunity and I am excited about it. But I also feel like I've lost a part of myself and my identity and it makes me happy and sad at the same time.

The restaurant industry taught me how to be an adult. It taught me how to work. It taught me how to celebrate everyday excellence. It taught me to appreciate and understand the flaws that we all have. It taught me more lessons and skills than I will ever be able to list. It's so alien to me that I'm not a part of it anymore.

I have met so many people who are beyond amazing, including the person who got me this fancy new job. From dishashers to managers, from more countries than I can count. It has been my privilege to know and be with and fight for all of you.

I'm sorry I am having a hard time processing my emotions right now and I needed to tell someone. Until recently I thought I was a lifer; quite a bit of my identity was the industry. At the same time there are many good things to come out of this move. Stability, benefits, PTO (!), the opportunity for advancement, home life, etc. If you weigh the pros and cons it's not a choice. But I've been a part of this fraternity for so long, it is hard to say that I no longer belong to it.

Thank you for being your amazing selves.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I was called into the place early, as there were lines out the door and a packed dining room throughout most of the day. The whole staff was strained due to this, because it was an unusual rush, and we were being drained of food. During the rush, I get a phone call about a catering order and it goes something like this:

Me: Hi this is \*restaurant's name,\* this is OP, how may I help you?

EL: I'm calling about my catering order I placed earlier, does my order come with \*insert specific item here\* (Omitting it because it's a restaurant signature and would give away the restaurant)

Me: Of course ma'am, all of our catering orders carry that item. The manager who placed the order with you should have gone over the specifics.

EL: Well she didn't. She left me on hold for 45 minutes! It's unacceptable!

Me: I'm sorry to hear that! I can take down your name and number and pass along the message to the general manager when they get back.

EL: That's unacceptable, and I don't trust someone as low level as you to tell them. You'll probably just blow me off! I want to speak to the manager now!

Me: Well the manager is currently out, I can pass you over to the team leader. Please hold.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I can hear her getting angry as I mute the microphone and go to the back. I hand my coworker the phone and tell her good luck. She takes one look at the ID and looks flustered. She takes the call and tells me the story after.

&amp;#x200B;

This lady is a regular. Her orders have always been right and she's known to throw a fit in before the orders come and then act pleasant when her caterings arrive. Today she calls in the middle of the rush, so they took down her name and number and tell her they will call back when the rush ends, and they can properly give her a quote. I guess this was unacceptable, because 15 minutes later she came into the store in person, yelling about how they left her on hold. Mind you, she wasn't. She has her dog who is not a service animal, barking and creating a scene. She is demanding to be served right away in that crowd, when they finally took her order. She finally left and had called the restaurant at least 4 more times throughout the day, using a harsh attitude and yelling at people about various parts of her order.

So I serve/manage a small family-run restaurant, and I have recently injured my knee. It may be my ACL so I'm wearing a brace for stability while I wait for an MRI. The brace doesn't fit very well under pants so I have been wearing shorts for my shifts which leaves the brace completely visible. 

I've stopped trying to count how many tables have asked me ""aww, what did you do to your knee?"" And it's driving me crazy at this point. I can usually brush it off with just ""oh may have torn my ACL"", and turn around and leave the table because I'm always busy and I don't have time to sit there and talk with everyone about what I've done.

I’m a waitress at a small family owned diner in the middle of nowhere, and somehow I always have at least 3 tables a day that make me question whether I should abandon my job, family, and move to the other side of the country.

Today, as in 20 minutes ago, cause I’m writing this immediately out of shock, I had a 4-top, young parents and their twin(?) toddlers. They seemed nice throughout their meal, a little harsh on the screaming kid, but not really TOO disruptive or demanding, anything like that.
But right before they paid their check, the mom went into the bathroom, and when she came out, she was screaming bloody murder, even though she was quiet the whole time she’d been in there, doing her business, etc etc

So, yelling right into my face, she says “SOMEONE SHIT ON THE FLOOR, and it looks like it’s been there for DAYS! This place is FILTHY, AND” of course, what else, “we want a refund or I’ll report you to the health department!”

And I had to explain that I had cleaned the bathroom a few minutes before they’d arrived, and nobody else had been in there between mopping and the “Poo Discovery”, with 4 of my regular construction worker customers confirming this

I told her I’d be happy to give a refund to anyone in that situation, but straight up said that I wasn’t paying her for shitting on the bathroom floor

This is one of the many interactions that reinforces my belief that if you want to have a child you should pass a test first. 

Set up: middle of an incredibly busy service around 7pm in one of the busiest area in London, we are 3 members of staff down. The phone rings and luckily I am the one that picks up. 

This lady books a table for next week, I see from our system that we are nearly fully booked but I try and squeeze her party of 5 because our system recognises her name and apparently she’s been here few times. 

Based on this I expect the lady to know what type of restaurant we are, but she proves me wrong, so here we go with the conversation that makes me dread the day she will come and dine. 

Me is myself, SC is space cadet, the woman that has been in our restaurant many times and still has no clue what we do.

SC: my 2yrs (age is important here) old nephew is seriously allergic to gluten, dairy and eggs, what can he have from the kids menu?

Me: madam we do not have kids menu but we will be happy to suggest some items from the sides sections, such as fries or some veggies

SC: he doesn’t eat that stuff, can you tell me about your roast? Do you have kids roast menu?

ME (while the restaurant is bursting with guests,  walk ins at the door, the other phone line ringing, food on the pass): madam we do not have kids menu, our roasts are “adult size” but if you’re happy to order it we can modify it without butter/gluten and eggs on the day of your reservation”  

SC: ok but can you not make a smaller portion for him? Like a half chicken?

ME: no madam, as I said we do not do half portion or kids portion, it’s a whole baby chicken, usually guests order it anyway and the parents/relatives eat half of it, OR they order sides for the kids. Why don’t you have a look on our website and see what he could have? We can modify pretty much everything as we cook fresh. 

SC: can’t you tell me now what he will be able to have? 

After listing all the items he could have, but making clear that we do not do half portions, she proceeds to tell me that her nephew doesn’t like most of those things.

At this point I was about to loose my patience, the rest of the staff was silently calling for my help for the actual service so I found a way to hang up after assuring her we’d our best. 

Not even 5 minutes into the service that the phone rings again, deep down in that part of my brain that recognises trouble immediately, I knew it was related to the space cadet woman. 

I answer, it’s a man, phew, no more oblivious woman! But I was wrong, very wrong.. he was the brother of said lady, the father of this poor little fella that’s allergic to the best things in life! 

The father opens the conversation with: my sister just booked a table for next week and my 1yrs old son is allergic to dairy, eggs and nuts.

ME: sorry sir but I thought your son was 2 and allergic to gluten eggs and dairy? No mention of nuts from your sister! 

TF: what? No! He’s only 1 and no no, he can have gluten but no eggs and no dairy and nuts so from your kids menu, what can he have? 

ME( I don’t have kids, I have no idea what they eat that young but I highly doubt that the diet of a STEAK HOUSE is recommended for a one year old): well sir, we don’t have kids menu but he can order some stuff from the sides?

TF: he doesn’t eat potatoes or vegetables, do you not have some plain chicken? Or what about your nut roast? 

ME: nut roast.... has nuts in it, isn’t your son allergic to nuts? It also comes with a cheese sauce! 

TF: Ah right, yes! He can’t have it then.. Well do you sell steaks? 

At this point I started to think it was all a prank, what kind of person calls a steak house, tries to modify the menu on the phone for a baby that could easily eat some baby stuff that you buy in shops and then drops this stupid question?

ME (with a very exasperated voice) : we have steaks, we have lots of steaks, if at 1 year he eats steak then you can order it on the day of your reservation. 

TF: wow cool! He loves steaks, we will see you next week then! 

Both conversations left me speechless for a couple of minutes, all the staff that was listening had a WTF face at the end. Now I’m left with so many questions.

Do babies eat steaks? Do the parents/relatives know the difference between the allergens? Is this baby going to live long enough to learn them by himself? 

And considering that was the easiest interaction of the evening I went home asking myself: did some kind of black hole full of stupidity opened up in our walk in fridge and now every single table is paying the consequences? ",0,You should know your kid diet better than us.,260

I walked into the office and announced myself to the receptionist.  Her abrupt response:

“You’re early.”  

I checked my clock,  It was 10:50.  

“Yeah” I said  “about 20 minutes.  Wasn’t sure how traffic would pan out.”

“More like 45 minutes...” she says tersely.  I check the paperwork in my hand.  It still says 11:15 delivery. Im a little confused now.  

I ask her where she wants the food set up, she points me to the conference room.

I set up the salads, sandwich trays, condiments &amp; utensils.  I asked the receptionist if I could walk her through the setup so she would know where everything was.  She declined, which I thought was weird.  I always walk the client though the set up.  It was 11 sharp when I left.

When I get back to the restaurant I read an email from the receptionist complaining that I was:  too early, a sandwich was missing,  that the sandwiches could “potentially” be soggy AND she was demanding a 50% discount.

A. Where the missing sandwich was ( on one of the trays)
B.  All the sandwiches are served dry with spreads on the side specifically so they wouldn’t get soggy

Worked in an upscale holiday park, with only one till that is used by the manager. All servers provide there own float and take responsibility for all there tables bills I.e if someone goes without paying, the server is liable for there bill. 
At the end of the shift the manager tells you what you owe the company in cash and card payments, you must pay the full amount regardless of what has happened during shift.

Always thought this policy was unfair. Especially as on the few occasions the fire alarm went off and the restaurant was cleared those who had finished eating rarely returned to settle the bill.

On this specific occasion I was working in the kids section (it had a soft play area in the corner) and a table of 2 arrived just before closing. The were seated the other end of the restaurant and I was told to serve them as well as my section. I complained I was too far from them to give the service they required but was told to get on with it.
Anyway, everything’s running smooth despite me not being able to glance over and check on them as often as I’d like. Gets to the end of the meal and they ask for the bill.
I bring it over and they say they have vouchers. I tell them I’ll be back in one moment to settle the  bill with them after dropping the bill at another table (giving them a minute or two in order to get the voucher and payment ready) and to make sure the vouchers are valid for our restaurant. 

I drop the bill on the kids section table and head back to find them missing and a £50 ‘love to shop’ voucher on the bill tray.
A voucher that isn’t accepted in my store. 
The bill is about £45 so I go speak to the manager.
He informs me I’m liable for the payment in full. I argue I was unable to do my job effectively while stretched across the length of the restaurant but the manager doesn’t care.

I’m annoyed, but accept it, begrudgingly. 
At the end of the shift when we are cashing off he manager asks me to pay the £45 on my debit card and return the voucher to him. 
Now I’m furious.
Firstly, I’m staff. So I expect 50% off the bill making it £22.50 not £45, and more importantly, why does the business, which does not accept these vouchers, taking the voucher from me?! 
I argued angrily for about 30 minutes until the bill was reduced for a staff member and it was agreed that I could keep the £50 voucher against the £22.50 I paid for there meal.

Sure the manager wanted to pocket the voucher himself, and that the customer was aware the voucher wasn’t acceptable after I motioned for them to check if it was but they were unlikely to know I would be responsible for there bill.

Long story short;
Customer tried to pay bill with invalid voucher, manager expected me to pay full price for there meal and keep the voucher for himself.

Back in my 20’s, I would fly off the handle at the drop of a hat. Never directly to my tables — but the amount of f-bombs and curses I called down on my customers was biblical in proportion.

I went into another job field for about seven years, then came back. Now that I’m older and wiser, I can see right through people. I’ve done this job long enough that I can tell what kind of person you are, and how the experience is going to go, within the first thirty seconds of talking to you. 

(Now, mind you, I had this skill even back in my 20s. But back then it infuriated me because I hoped against hope that maybe this time the table would be different. It never, ever was, which was why I would get so angry.)

Now I just don’t give a shit. I mean, I do, I’m a professional, it’s my job. But I can see through all the bullshit and at this point, I honestly don’t care. I want to give you an awesome experience, but some people come in with the specific goal of being pissed off, remaining pissed off, and spreading that pissed offness to as many people as possible. I cannot help those people.

But if a table is being assholes and they’re running me and asking for stupid little stuff, I bring it out in embarrassingly inordinate amounts. Setting down a salad bowl full of ranch for one couple may seem excessive but it gets the point across and I don’t have to bring them 18 ramikens of ranch like they want me to. Same with drinks. If the kids are sucking them down, or the adults, you’re getting less and less ice. I don’t give a shit if your kid drinks nine Dr Peppers. It’s 9:50 pm and you’re gonna have to deal with the sugarsmacked maniac later, not me.

Even if I get stiffed, I don’t punch the wall anymore or scream in the freezer. I just shrug, say fuck them, and forget them — because I’ll most likely never ever see them again, ever. So why should I let one table of schmucks ruin my night? I get way more good tips than bad tips, so, eh.

I greeted them and laughed along with them as they were looking through the beer lists, as “it had been a long week”.  Only the mom orders a beer - a 22oz Shocktop.

I bartend at my local bar and grill and have quite a few regulars that I enjoy, some that are alright and one or two that I don’t mind seeing when they’re around. 

So last night I have a regular, one who doesn’t fall into any of those categories. He’s just there. Doesn’t talk much, tips decent to average (which honestly doesn’t bother me because I make minimum plus tips.) 

I am slammed last night; full bar, 30+ people and taking a table or two, and seating people because we’re short a server and host. Bar guest orders boneless wings sauce on the side. A server runs the food and the sauce, of course, is on the wings. The server makes a comment that they’re bringing correct ones but since we’re busy to just enjoy them for now; and he does. 

Fast forward about 15 min and he has about 2 of 10 left, I ask if he wants the other wings or not since it’s taking awhile. He says “no.” 

I mentioned to my manager he no longer wanted them but they were already being made. Fast forward 5 min and he brings them out. Instead of dropping them off to him, we dropped  them off to a group of regulars who are always there, fun and easy going people because why not; plus we were just going to throw them anyway. He sees this and flips out.

Reg: “well?!” 

Me: (hands flailing) “well?!!” 

I proceed to tell my boss and he begrudgingly takes them off. I’m so mad I don’t want to talk to him and of course as I’m passing he makes a comment on how busy we are and I fill him in on all the other things I’m doing aside from bartending. I drop off his check at the end of the meal, with his wings clearly missing because he only paid for two drinks. He didn’t say a word, didn’t even bring up the fact that we took it off his bill. He left $3 on what should have been a $30 tab. The tip doesn’t bother me. What does is that he didn’t even bother to say thanks after all of that, which I feel is the least he could have done. 

TLDR; Regular asked for boneless wings sauce on the side, they came out wrong we’re  in the process of making him new ones, said he didn’t want them, ate the wrongly made order and was mad that we gave away “his” wings when they were delivered to another group of regulars.

Hey y'all!

Background: So I work at your typical Bovine Wacky Wings and we're all trained to check for valid IDs for the purchase of alcohol. We have the right to refuse an ID for obvious reasons; underage patrons, scratches, missing chunks, expiration etc etc. The most common issue we have when refusing IDs is people bringing in very old identification and getting upset when it won't be accepted. Our managers are great about this, they will almost always back you up in refusing to accept ID but will sometimes make exceptions if the customer is nice enough.

So on to the main story. I had just sat a 6-top and was grabbing drink orders for them when one guy in the group asked for a tall beer. I ID'd him and he produces a passport for me to view. This passport has expired. 6 years ago. So this is our exchange:

M: Me

C: Customer

B: Bossman

M: ""I'm sorry do you have a non expired form of ID?""

C: ""No, that's all I got.""

M: ""Unfortunately, I can't accept this as it's no longer valid. Can I get you anything else to drink? Soda or water?""

C: ""No, I want a beer, just use that ID.""

M: ""I'm really sorry, sir, but I cant.""

C: ""What's the problem? It's got my face and age on it, they always let me use it here!""

M: ""Would you like me to get the manager? He may be able to bend the rules for you but I don't have the authority to do that.""

C: ""Yeah, go get him.""

So I go to the back and find the Bossman and give him a rundown of the situation. He says he'll go over and talk to the table. So, me being nosy, I hid in the corner near the table so I could watch everything. (You never know who's gonna kick up a fuss but I LOVE the drama so I was waiting just in case.) The man talks to my manager for a few minutes before the whole table got up and left.

Bossman come over to me laughing:

B: ""You should've told me it was over 6 years expired! I was gonna make an exception if it was only off by a year or less but that's ridiculous! Who can't get a new passport after 6 years?""

Very anticlimactic ending but Team Bossman for sticking with me.

Then we find out a week before the event that it’s not for you. It’s for your 12 year olds birthday and there will be 50+ kids in attendance. With all the grace of a wet paper napkin hitting a blender on full speed you asked us, *is that a problem?* 

Yes it was a goddamn problem. But we explained to you kindly that we could not provide childcare, that supervision would be needed and all you’d be getting was the space. You asked if we could show the kids how to make mocktails and again, we threw that in for free while you complained about the price, £200 for an entire night and a bartender with seven years experience. 

On the day, you showed up half an hour early and ordered drinks while I was still setting up the bar. I’d prepped some beers in a nice little ice bucket arrangement, but you and the  three Karens of the apocalypse wanted cocktails at your 12 year olds goddamn birthday party.

As an adult I decided that until something changes legislatively to ensure a living wage for service workers I would do my little part by being a good tipper.

Now my wife and I do not go out to eat much.  We go to breakfast at a southern chain on the weekends and occasionally to dinner.

I started about 10 years ago always giving a 100% tip when we do go out.  This isn't a lot of money to me and I just feel like as many crappy people as a server has to deal with every day it might be nice for them to have someone ""settle up"" for them so to speak.

Now when we go to a random restaurant for dinner, it isn't a big deal.  We usually tip on the CC or if I happen to have cash I'll slide it under a drink and we get out dodge as there really isn't a need for an awkward thank you.

The problem we are starting to see is with the routine visits to the same breakfast spot.  I guess word has gotten around to all of the servers and now there is a lot of ""jockeying"" when we come in to get us to sit in their sections.  This makes us very uncomfortable.

We just want to enjoy our breakfast and do our little part to help out people in an industry that I think gets the shit-covered end of the stick when it comes to respect and compensation.

This could probably be considered an r/entitledparents but I'm just gonna throw it here.

So I work at this place near a pretty popular Jewish deli. We serve Japanese/Hawaiian food and our plates are about $7-10 and are actually worth the price since the portions are sizeable.
My boss is a bit of a cheapskate and we have our fair share of easily fixable problems that just haven't been dealt with because Mr. Boss Man thinks $300 is too much to fix the 3 broken sinks we have in the kitchen. We also use these plastic cups with numbers on them for in house orders, and little cards with numbers for to-go ones. (this is important later!!)
We have a lot of regulars and even though I've been working there for only a few months I know a lot of our customers really well and consider them good people. 
We also get a lot of people coming in expecting the old menu and getting irritated or disappointed that we've changed our menu. This happened before I started working here, but we basically used to serve sushi and chow mein but don't anymore because we don't have cooks trained to do those things.

So the family that comes in is one of the ones that hasn't been since the menu change and voices their irritation. 
I apologise and explain that the change happened before my employment and explain the gist of why things were different.

""We came here because the noodles were so good and you gave a lot of food and free sides""

I'm immediately on guard. Free sides? In this establishment? Internally I'm wheezing with laughter.
I, once again, apologise. A little less sincere now that this person has, for some reason, lied to me.

""OOOH! Money!!""

The plastic tip jar is yoinked off the metal counter and plastic order numbers fly from their basket. The only thing stopping a successful theft is a shitty little cord which I hated until this exact moment.  I stare in shock at the customer's son who just tried to take what little extra money my under minimum wage self earns. 

What? The heck? Did that really just happen?????

The parents immediately turn to their son and scold him for trying to take something that isn't his. I'm more surprised that anyone would try and steal two singles and a dime than anything, even if it is just a kid.

Things calm down for a moment, the parents order and I give their number to the boy, attempting to placate him a bit.
He immediately loses all interest in the blue plastic cup once he learns it is not for soda and instead turns his gaze on the cups he knows for a fact... Are for sweet sickly carbonated nectar.
He grabs a medium cup, reaching around his mom and up past the register.
I try to stop him vocally by saying 
""I'm sorry but I think you should ask your parents if you can get one of those""
But he's already grabbed it
The parents groan and scold him again saying now they have to buy it but I offer to either charge them for a small or just toss out the cup and let them be.

""No he already touched it just charge me""

Hm. Okay. I will.
So I charge the dad for one of our $2 drinks even though our smalls are like. $1.25

So I think this is the worst of it. They'll be fine once they get their $40 worth of food. They'll leave a message table and no tip but this is the worst it will get.
Boy howdy do I love being proven wrong!

Order number 3 is ready so I grab as many plates as I can and go
I see only the little boy seated at the table and do everything I can not to roll my eyes.

""Hey I have some plates for you and your folks! I have this right here...""

I slide a chicken bowl past him. No response. I put down a beef steak plate with no cabbage and extra macaroni. Still nothing. I slide a Portuguese sausage plate with eggs over easy right to this kid. 
He sneers at me as if I farted right on his food.

So I think. What the hell. I've been holding in a real fart the whole shift. Screw you kid.
And I attempt to crop-dust this kid while turning to go grab more plates of food for him and his folks.
But it is not silent. And I feel a trickle of shame creep up my neck
But. Within the exact moment I turn my back. 
This little evil child from hell yells

and throws an entire plate of food at me.
The sound of thick porcelain dropping onto the floor with a horrible CRACK covers the sound of my own crime.
But the entire restaurant goes silent.
Except for this kid.
He's going batshit, screaming at me for not bringing his food
I have been flipped off. Cursed at. Called all sorts of names. I have been SPAT on.
But nothing shook me quite the way the sensation of freshly cooked eggs and sausage scalding my lower back did.
I turned and looked at this kid. Not knowing what to do. How do I react? What do I say? 
Before I can do anything my boss rushes out from the back of the kitchen to see which one of his fool employees broke a plate. 
He looks at me. Looks at this kid screaming his head off at me sitting alone at a table.
The kids parents finally appear, I have no idea where they were. I don't care to be honest.
I look at my boss and I just start picking up the shattered plate and ruined food.
My boss comes over and asks me what happened and then sees my shirt.
There's really no way that I could've gotten egg on the back of my shirt and hair on my own accord so he puts two and two together
(My stunned silence is also probably a huge indicator)

And my boss looks this family in the face and tells them to leave.
And I damn near thought my knees would give out.
The last thing I expected was for my penny pinching boss to tell paying customers to get out but. Here we were. 
He told me to continue cleaning, so I did, happy to get the hell out of metaphorical Dodge.
But I overheard most of what was said
My boss gave an ultimatum. Either leave or pay for the broken plate and my employees ruined clothes.
The family left, not without yelling up a storm about the food they paid for or defending their kid. But they left. And my boss got me another shirt and apologized for what happened

And the rest of the night went by pretty fast after that.

We used to have a spinach dip on our menu that came with carrots, celery, and cucumbers. People could switch out the vegetables for corn tortilla chips if they wanted to. 

This woman is sitting with a man and orders the dip, but tells me she needs the vegetables to be on a separate plate entirely away from the dip because she is allergic to all vegetables. This sounds ridiculous at first, but one of my friends has this thing called Oral Allergy Syndrome where she can't eat a lot of raw fruits and vegetables because it makes her mouth itch. I figure it's something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

So just to be clear, I ask, ""Is it all raw vegetables, or are cooked ones okay?""

Lady: ""Not that it's any of your business, but as I said, I'm allergic to all vegetables! ALL VEGETABLES."" 

Me: ""I'm sorry to seem intrusive, but I only ask because there is cooked spinach and tomato in the spinach dip.""

Lady: ""I know what I can and can't eat! Just bring me the dip with the vegetables on the side! Can you do that or not?""

Me: ""Of course. I'll be right back.""

&amp;#x200B;

I tell my manager about this, because I want to let him know that I am trying not to kill or injure this woman via allergies, and she told me that the dip was fine. He says to wait a minute before I put the order in so he can offer her the chip replacement option (which I should have done, but she basically dismissed me). Even though they have corn in them, maybe she'll want those instead of the vegetables. Maybe she doesn't like vegetables and said she was allergic, maybe she really is allergic to just raw vegetables and is confused about what I was asking. Who knows. 

About two minutes later, I hear ""ALL VEGETABLES!"" being yelled at my manager from the table. He comes over and tells me, defeated, to just put the order in and make a note to the chefs about putting the vegetables on a totally separate plate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go to check on them after the food is delivered. I had brought them separate appetizer plates so the woman could get her own helping of the dip and avoid cross contamination. The man is eating the dip out of the shared bowl with the veggies, and the woman is dipping a spoon into the dip and just eating it like that. Just sucking on a spoon and putting it right back into the communal, contaminated dip. Neither of them are using their appetizer plates.

&amp;#x200B;

They said everything was great. I stopped questioning it and just let them get on with it.

Some background: we’re a small restaurant that  does a special event every Thanksgiving, people book and pay in advance, and **every dime that isn’t tax or tip, goes to charity.** This means customers are normally in very high spirits - enjoying a good meal for a good cause.

At our first seating of the day (we do several seatings for big events), a couple comes in, they seem pretty normal. The first course comes out and the gentlemen claims that his wife’s meal is cold. Now I’m not saying we’re above mistakes, but these course dinners are very hard to get cold, because as soon as they’re done they go *immediately* out.

Our manager comes by and apologizes. After loudly going back and forth for a bit, my manager offers to comp the meal. **Side note**: if you expect your meal for free at a charity event, you’re a douchebag.

As he picks up the wife’s meal, her butter knife slides off of the plate and hits the table. This is obviously my manager’s fault, but no customer has ever been egregiously offended.

At this point the husband stands up with so much force that his chair slides a foot behind him. He gets into my manager’s face and says “What are you doing to my *WIFE*? You hurt her!”

We’re a small place, so everyone is silent and staring. 

My manager waits a moment and (in response to being shouted at) says “Sir, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to drop the knife, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

At this point, the asshole is completely taken aback. Apparently no one has ever asked him to leave a restaurant before.

My manager walks away, and this douchebag takes his plate and scrapes all of his food onto the floor. Then takes he and his wife’s glasses of wine, and dumps them on the table.

At this point the wife is horrified, quickly grabs her things and shuffles out. He leaves and all the other tables were completely tickled by the scene. It put everyone in a surprisingly good mood to banter about for the rest of the evening.

It all started when the closing manager had his car break down. He was supposed to be there at two and wouldn’t be able to make it till 8. This left only a manager in training my himself, and we called in a a shift leader just in case. Monday’s are SLOW so we’re normally pretty short staffed (about 7-8 servers and two grill cooks). 

We get slammed out of nowhere. The line is backed up our the door, we’re beginning to run 20 minute checks because of the overwhelming crowd. Then it starts storming...bad. Rain is coming down sideways, thunder and lighting every few seconds. And then the power goes out. 

It was only out for about 30 seconds max, but it set off a chain of events. For starters it took down our ventilation system. We have a huge wood fireplace in our restaurant that some Karen INSISTED on being lit despite it being 68 outside. The fans and vents both fail. The room fills with smoke fast. Guests are wetting napkins over their mouths to try and fight it. Our eyes are running, we’re choking , even visibility is getting hard. 

The MIT panicked and opens the emergency door to try and get the smoke out. Which he entered the code to before...but because of the power failure the alarm system went off for two hours straight. At this point guests are beginning to leave and honestly who could blame them? The soda and coffee machine short circuit. Nobody knows how to fix it. 

Then the grand finale happens: our entire grill system goes down. No matter who we call or what we try, it refuses to come back on. This all happened in under 30 minutes. We went from a full house to 5 tables left in the entire building who had decided to try and tough it out. 

We didn’t get the grill running for at least an hour but at that point our clientele were gone. We all left about an hour and a half before closing. On the bright side, all my tables felt so bad for me I ended up walking with 35% of my sales.

Its a stable consistent job, decent money and not usually too late of hours. Similar to a service job in that I never know when I will be finished and hours can change drastically. I do enjoy working alone all day which is very different from serving and chatting all day.

However I have bad knees and jumping in and out of the truck is getting hard on them so I am looking for something new, if not full time at least to start on the weekends for extra cash.

My girlfriend serves at a restaurant and makes very good tips. It is a nicer chain restaurant, not anything you would need to dress up for but nicer than say Montanas and about on par with a Milestones. 

I am wondering if it would be worth it for me to begin serving either on the side or full time. I have spent about 4 years working in restaurants in my youth from about 2009-2013 working in the kitchen but I am not interested in going back into the kitchen.

I know as a good looking girl my girlfriend will make more tips than me as a goodish looking guy but she can make almost 200 in just tips on a busy night. Because of this it seems like it could be an undervalued option for me to go into. I am making about 150 a day after tax give or take now so I am thinking between tips and the pay that matching that should be doable.

 Do you guys think it would be a good plan for me to try and get into a nicer type restaurant as a server? I am thinking starting evenings and weekends if possible and then make a decision about whether to keep my full time job or move full time into serving.

Any specific restaurants or types of restaurant to try to get into in southern ontario? Or to avoid?
Things to look for? 
Anything else you can think of that I may not be considering?

Another extra benefit to serving would be good experience for my resume if i ever decide to move out west to a resort restaurant or something like that. I was out in Alberta at an a resort and my roommate (an english guy) made 150-250 a night in tips thanks to tourists and his accent. Made me very jealous.

So for context, I used to be a drive-thru barista when I was in high school, working my shifts alone. It wasn’t a bikini stand or anything, just a regular coffee stand. I dealt with the usual bitchy moms with 7 screaming kids in the car, girls who only get drinks to post on Snapchat (I was amazed that this stereotype actually exists), etc no problem. But there’s one customer who takes the cake for the absolute worst, and I’m still petty about it 

She pulls up in this car with a bedazzled camouflage license plate. She’s probably like 30, 35. There’s her kid in the back seat. After a few minutes of asking me to explain “what’s in this?” “what’s in this?” on the menu, she finally settles on one of our blended drinks. She also demands that I show her each of our cups, because apparently it’s too much effort for her to visualize what 12, 16, 24 etc ounces looks like. At this point, there’s a couple cars waiting at the other window, but I can’t even ask for their orders because this woman keeps asking questions about the goddamn cups. She had a very uppity way of talking too; it was clear from her tone that she viewed me as below her. Anyway, once I finally started making her drink, here’s how the interaction went from there:

*as I’m putting the ingredients in the blender* 

Her: Whats that? What are you putting in there? Why so much ice? Oh, by the way, I want caramel in it.

Me: *answers her questions as I go* Okay, I’ll add caramel! 

Her: Also, my son wants an Italian soda. What flavors do you have? Show me the cup sizes again for his drink. 

Me, trying desperately to stay peppy and polite as there’s like 4 cars waiting now: For sure! Here’s the flavor list. And I finished your drink, here ya go. 

Her: ...where’s the caramel? 

Me: Haha, what do you mean? I added it in for you. 

Her: I wanted a caramel /swirl/ on the sides of the cup. Ugh, make it again. I can’t drink this. 

Me, suppressing anger and stress: Alright. Let me know when you see a flavor you like for the Italian soda. 

I’ll spare you guys the rest of the conversation, because it was basically just her asking a bunch of questions again and nitpicking what I was doing (“that’s too much syrup! it’ll be too strong for my son!” “I want more caramel!” etc). 

But unfortunately, the ending to this story is the worst part. After I finally finished her two drinks and was handing them to her, at this point with like 6 cars waiting, I told her the total after tax. She said, “Oh that’s too expensive. Fix your prices and then maybe I’ll come back again.” She didn’t take the drinks and sped off before I could say anything. I was p i s s e d. And of course, because the other cars had been waiting so long, none of them tipped. If she hadn’t been asking me unnecessary questions and demanding that I show her things then I could’ve handled the rush smoothly. I’m definitely not quick to anger, I’ve probably been truly angry only like twice in my life, but that woman got my blood boiling. But I hope it’s an entertaining story at the very least!

961,zombiemeowth,0,t3_b677k2,8,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b677k2/sorry_shes_on_meth/,"I’m the manager of a new restaurant in town, but I also take tables and bartend. I’ve learned to juggle quickly! Anyway this happened Monday to one of my servers, but I intervened and got the meth line. 

3 people come in, 2 women and a guy, and immediately start talking about how overpriced our food is. Our menu is al la cart and caters to the downtown crowd in my town who want modern and interesting food. They also said they were drunk, which I didn’t hear. The server that got stuck with their table is new and didn’t really think to turn them away because she wanted the business. 

Anyway, from the bar I could hear them complaining our food wasn’t what they thought as they browsed the menu. They ordered so I didn’t think twice about it and kept busy making drinks. When the sever ran their food I saw one of the women getting upset and shoving her tray so I immediately stopped what I was doing and went over there. 

She claims she told the sever she was allergic to fish but my server was trying to serve her fish. The lady said she wanted everything on the fish dish minus the actual fish. I was confused and asked her to clarify and she threw a wadded up napkin down and said she wanted chicken. We have multiple chicken dishes so I asked her to clarify again. Through trial and error, I managed to drag out what she wanted. 

Meanwhile the guy with her, who I’ve now noticed is definitely drunk, starts waving his hand telling me to go away and that everything’s fine. I told them it wasn’t a problem and would be back with the dish she wanted. 

We have an open kitchen so I couldn’t ask the server about it without pulling her way back and she told me the lady was yelling at her, telling her our food was disgusting and she was disgusting. I decided to take care of the table as much as I could after because the sever definitely doesn’t need that abuse and it was uncalled for. 

I ran the lady her new food. She said “this is it?”. Yes, that’s it. She wanted vegetables. Pepper, specifically. I asked what kind and she yelled peppers again. I was like ok bell peppers? We don’t have those, they’re not authentic to the area our menu is from. She rolled her eyes and had me list every veggie I could get her. 

And I did. 

I ran her the sides of veggies that were specially prepped by the kitchen. She shoved the tray and asked for cheese. Again, told her it wasn’t standard but got her cheese. 

5 minutes goes by and their server walks by and asks if they have room for dessert (she’s an angel and upsells like a champ). The woman all but throws her plate at the server and says she’s not paying. I walk over and the other woman gets up and says she’s leaving. 

At this point I’m full on arguing with this woman. What she didn’t eat, the guy ate. The only thing she didn’t eat was the chicken dish, which she chewed up and spit out in a napkin and shoved it in my chest while saying, “there’s your fucking chicken.”

At this point the guy tells her to shut the fuck yo and he leaves. I’m having a stare down with this woman. I told her she needs to leave. She crossed her arm and told me to call the owner because he wouldn’t dare stand for me to talk to a customer like that. I told her I’m more than capable but she kept insisting so I did. He asked what was going on and as I’m explaining she’s shouting, “that’s your story! Bullshit! You’re such a liar! I’ll have you know I lived in (area where our menu is from) and they have peppers!”  My boss is confused and to get some peace I stepped in the kitchen - which is open, remember - and as I turned around I saw her hair whip and she was gone. 

There was a brief oh shit they didn’t pay the bill moment but to get them gone I was gonna swallow it. As soon as I hung up with my boss the two servers working came back and were like... “she stole the cup”. We have these speciality cups for one of our drinks and it’s an ooh and aww thing. Anyway, she mixed all 3 cocktails on the table together and ran out the door. 

I went to bus the table and the guy comes back in and sits down to FINISH EATING. I swallowed my pride and went over to apologize for raising my voice (mostly wanted to see if it was going to escalate again and try to get him to leave). He looked up at me and gave me this story about how she’s been with this guy who’s been beating her and he saw she was homeless on Facebook and wanted to help his friend out. Then he casually said, “I’m sorry, she’s on meth.” 

What. 

He also told the server he was going to leave a big tip for her troubles then tipped 5 bucks on an 88 dollar bill.

 We're a smallish, family owned restaurant, 80% regulars and we do home delivery and take away too. Now, one of our pick-up regulars is missing half an arm  and always comes in to get around 15 pizzas and the first time I served him, I asked him if I should open the door for him, because unfortunately our entrance doors open inwards (super annoying) and I actually ask this everyone who carriers their food out - and he had *a lot* of pizzas. He grunted ""no"" and left and a guy sitting on the bar who works with him and that I talk to  pretty often, said: ""well you offended him, he hates people offering him help"" So I thought about that and explained that I ask this everyone and that I don't plan on stop being friendly because it offends him.

But, the second time I served him I decided I'm just not gonna ask and already said ""enjoy your meal sir"" when my mum goes: ""well open the door, won't you"" , I looked at him, he smiled and said ""nah thank you, I'm fine"" so I replied ""alright then, thank you and have a good day"", he wishes me the same and walks to the door when other people who know him jump up and go ""hey lemme help you"" etc. , he says something in the line of ""nope"", but is still smiling and proceeds to walk out, actually carrying those 15+ pizzas better than some of our delivery guys would, so  I ask: ""hey, have you been working in service before?"" and he laughed and replied that he grew up in a bakery.

Honestly I don’t get the obsession with booths. I understand that maybe you want a ‘cozier’ setting for your meal, but I know where I work the booths and tables are practically the same. The chairs are padded with the same material as the booths. The tables the same size. Hell, we even have tables where you can sit side by side with your table-mates (like in a booth). Your food will taste the same, it’ll come out the same time. So what’s the big deal???

We even get some people who are absolutely dead set on a booth and will wait an hour plus for one. Or people who get upset when all the booths are taken by other diners. One table got pissed that our half booth, half table wasn’t all booth (for nine people? Good luck). 

I just don’t get it. 

Edit: I also just wanted to add, requesting a booth on a busy weekend night, even if you have a reservation, isn’t going to always pan out. You want a booth now? 10 other people specifically requested one when they made the reso a week ago, and while I’ll do my best to swap stuff I can’t promise you that I can give you a booth. 

Secondly, sections aren’t always split evenly in my restaurant. We have a patio, a bar room, and the dining room— sometimes servers get 2 booths and 6 tables, or 4 booths and 4 tables, or 1 booth and 7 tables. We have to balance the amount of tables a server has with where the tables are in the restaurant (it would suck to have a section split over 3 areas). Requesting a booth when I seat you at a table may throw off the rotation or tip the scales against a server, *particularly if the last four tables have requested a booth*. And although I try my best to account for this, I can’t make customers understand that no, you can’t have that booth, X hasn’t been sat in almost a half hour and it’ll mean Y is triple sat. 

Lastly, and this is more petty, but don’t wait until I’ve walked away from your table to chase me down and ask for a booth. If it’s so important, ask when you come to the host stand, not when you’re at your table. ",0,Booths.,28
967,PenumbraVeil,0,t3_b6cbgn,4,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b6cbgn/a_warranted_walkout/,"(posting from mobile, but I'll try to make the format affable)

I've been working at a restaurant at a senior living community for almost a full year now. It has a casual style bistro area, a coffee shop/cafe area, and a fine dining style dining room. About a week ago, a new person started (they will be known as D). I met them yesterday and they seemed nice enough, which is why what they did earlier this morning is rather confusing to me.

For context, yesterday at lunch was extremely busy, probably the busiest I've seen yet. Hence there were a LOT of dishes by the time we were done with dinner. Washing itself didn't take that long, but there were a good chunk of utensils that were not able to get ""polished"" (wiped down with a towel to remove any lingering water spots from the dishwasher). Therefore, the manager told us to leave them for the openers to finish in the morning.

My co-workers filled me in when I came in for evening shift that apparently, when D came in this morning with the other opener, she wasn't happy about having to wipe off the utensils. The other opener was most likely one of the coffee shop people, since that opens before the restaurant by about an hour, so while they were brewing coffee D wouldn't likely have much else to do. This led to them making a statement about how all of us ""weren't working as a team"" and ""couldn't communicate""(?), and then they ended up walking out later that morning.

I'm try to by empathetic, as I don't know D personally and maybe something outside of the job contributed to this. I've walked out of a job myself in the past, but that was due to several issues that kept repeating themselves , not one instance. However, the more I mull it around in my head, I just can't see the logic here. You're faced with an extra task to do in the morning, something that, while tedious is pretty simple and easily done, but instead of at least trying you quit your barely week-old job entirely?

The dreaded regular I have always, without fail, buys the biggest coffee she can. It's either 'not hot enough' or 'is this fresh?' or, the occasional, 'that looked pretty pale' in that nasally voice of hers. That last one in particular irks me because 1) normal coffee is not tar black when it's poured, everyone knows that and 2) our coffee has never changed in any way in the three years I've been here. The others are kinda dumb too, mostly because she comes in during peak time, so at most every pot of coffee (in thermal one mind you) is ten minutes old.

Today she decided to find a new way to annoy us. Today, she made me angry.
 
So like all our local sister stores, we have two windows (open all day everyday, except for rare exceptions) to move our drive-thru line quickly. Today was one of those exceptions; the card reader back there stopped working, so we had closed the first window for about an hour. As luck would have it, it was during one of our early rush hours, when Picky came through.

I was trying to quickly cash out someone at the widow when I heard her dreaded voice yell ""HELLO?"" at my speaker. Before I could greet her (barely five seconds) I see her pull forward, just out of range for her to hear me. I sighed deeply before returning to the window where I juggled between order taking, cashing out, and handing out food. My co-worker focused mainly putting orders together so they didn't realise Picky was here.

Picky finally gets to my window two minutes later and complains, in that grating voice, that no one answered her and that she'll order here. Right after she pays, she pretty much demands her coffee, while I'm taking another order. I kept my composure as I got it for her, no way I could fake it till I make it right then, and she speeds off like normal.

It took me a bit to calm down after that. Then of course, my manager got the card reader sorted, and comes up front demanding to know why out times are so high. All I could say was that ""rude customers tend to do that"", with no reply.

So this happened on “Koningsdag” (kingsday) in The Netherlands last year. As I am a student, a lot of my friends have jobs in hospitality (Some part time, like me, others full time). On this particular day I did not have to work, as you probably know that national hollidays don’t count  as off days if you work in hospitality, and I was relieved. A friend of mine did have to work, and he works in the kitchen of a bar/café in the city centre of the city where I live. 

We decided that I would go to his work to pick him up when he was done (and of course, drink a beer there before going into the crowded bars). 

So when I arrive, there is this guy passed out next to the place where my friend works, surrounded by police officers. 

I go inside and one of my friend’s colleagues explains what happened (It happens quite often that I go pick up this friend before we go out, as he is often the first to get off work in our group of friends, so I know some of the other people working there). Appearantly, this guy came into the bar/café and asked for a pizza with shoarma (shoarma: Turkish kebab). The waiters just told him that he should go to the neigbours, the two places look nothing alike, just to give an idea of how absolutely pissed he was.

About half an hour later he walked past the restaurant (appearantly he found that pizza he was craving), and just collapsed. Because of the holliday there was a lot of police present, who immediatly surrounded him to make sure he was ok and keep him safe. This was when I arrived. After about half an hour he woke up and upon seeing the police he starts screaming: “you can’t arrest me, let me go, i did nothing wrong” etc. The police were not detaining him at that moment, so he got up en walked/ran away.
 
The police just let him be, as he was not annoying/posing a danger to anyone.

Guy runs in to a café wanting a pizza, he ment to go to the neigbours. Leaves, later walks by and passes out, police surround him and he thinks he is being arrested eventhough he is not.

3 minutes later this shithead calls me over.

Customer: Yo miss, I want to exchange my Pad Thai to shrimp tempura roll.

Me: Is there something wrong with the Pad Thai sir. 

Customer: nah I just don’t want it; I changed my mind, want to change it to another shrimp tempura roll instead. 

Me: sir the noodles are served to you already, you can’t just exchange it for something else.

So after two minutes of him arguing with me. I tell my coworker to deal with him as I calm myself down in the kitchen. I don’t understand why people think they can just do this at restaurants. The Mofo had so much time to tell me he wanted to modify his order.",0,"Customers exchanging food, as if its a clothing item.",49

2) I didn't see them as I was seating another guest.

this is my friend, maple, and her nightmare shift, and i’m very glad i wasn’t on call this day.

she gets a text two hours before she clocks in from our coworker (let’s call her cindy) that she needs to clock in early. maple comes in to see the place is dead (not unusual). so there she is, standing around, cindy AND our boss nowhere to be found

until the floodgates open

a mother and son walk in and ask for shaved ice. then the phone rings. maple takes the phone order first (it’s a higher priority). she hangs up and the phone rings again. suddenly, a swarm of hungry customers come in. 

maple is alone. cindy is still nowhere to be found.

about 30 minutes pass. maple is constantly writing orders. they never stop coming in. my god, she’s a soldier. the mother and son ask for a refund, but end up getting their shaved ice anyway. 

then the worst possible thing happens. 

we run out of teriyaki sauce. 

the people beg for their sweet nectar, but alas, there is none left. our boss comes in carrying raw slabs of meat on each arm, and puts a sign up on the door that breaks the hearts of the masses. 

“no more teriyaki sauce”

they still come in. they still beg for their sweet, sweet sauce. the udder is dry. no more teriyaki in this local japanese fusion restaurant.

So in my experience, mechanics often times have a bad reputation for ripping people off. Obviously they're just the bad apples of the group, but they get the most attention. I'd like to share a story of one of the good apples. This happened years ago when my son was still a baby, like under 2 years old. My husband, son, and I live in Central Florida. I decided to take a trip up to visit my parents, who live in Pa. Just my son and I, husband had to work. So we packed up and I drove up over 2 days, a trip I'd done many times in the past, but never as the only adult. The drive up was uneventful, and we had a nice time with my family. 

When the time came to return home, on the first day of driving I made it to South Carolina before deciding to stop for the night. Got going the next morning eager to get home. After driving awhile on I95 I started to notice the smell of gasoline. I brushed it off, thinking I'd dripped some on my hands or something when I'd last filled up. But it didn't go away, and I started to notice, with a sinking feeling in my stomach, that the gas gauge was dropping quicker than it should be.  I was internally panicking, I had no idea what to do. I looked out the rear view mirror and I could see a definite line of something dripping from underneath the minivan. This is when I pulled off at the next exit, having NO idea what to do. I had a cell phone, but this was before smartphones so it wasn't like I could google anything. I just drove down the road, looking for anything where I could possibly get help. It was one of those typical exits on 95, full of fast food, motels, gas stations, etc. It looked like a pretty busy area, so I was hoping I'd find something. 

Fortunately not too far down the road I saw a small auto repair shop. It wasn't a chain store or anything, just a local shop. I pulled in, pretty much on the verge of tears, and took my son, who was getting antsy because I hadn't stopped to eat or anything. I went in the office and I remember that I talked to an older man who happened to be the owner of the shop. I told him what happened, and he said he'd take a look. I'm sitting there shaking, trying to get my son to sit still and eat some snacks. Because now I'm worried that it's something major wrong, and while I had money on me, plenty to get home under regular circumstances, I had no where near enough for car repair. Not to mention worrying that it couldn't be fixed at all.

So after a while, the owner comes back and tells me that some pipe that the gas runs though (sorry I know nothing about cars) is cracked. My heart sinks. Then he tells me that he doesn't even have a replacement, and it would take days to order one. Cue more internal panicking. And a bit of external panicking as I'm trying really hard not to cry. 

Then he says, ""But I can run down to \*whatever store it was\* and get something to patch it up, so you will definitely be able to make it home. I tearfully told him, ""absolutely"" and thanked him. I was still worrying about the money, though. After a bit of waiting, the patch job was finished, and he assured me it would be fine til I got back to FL.

 I nervously asked how much I owed him, getting out my wallet, and he just said, ""Nothing, don't worry about that, just get home safely."" I was a bit in shock and basically thanked him over and over before getting me and the kid into the van and getting back on the road. Even though it was years ago, I still remember that overwhelming feeling of relief and gratitude. I know he must have felt sorry for me, being so pathetic looking, but it was so kind of him to go out of his way to help me, this person he'd never met before, and not even charge me anything. 

I have one regret though, and that is that I was so overwhelmed the whole time, I didn't think to remember the name of the shop, grab a business card, nothing. I wish I could have thanked him again, let him know I got back home with no problems. I don't even remember which exit it was, because they all look so similar. I only remember that it was somewhere around Savannah, Ga.  But, eternal thanks to that repair shop owner, he really saved me that day. 

Oh, and not only did I make it home safely, that ""patch job"" he did lasted YEARS. Money was tight so we always thought, eh, we'll wait til it starts leaking again to get it fixed. But the rest of the van died before that patch ever did. So that was pretty amazing.",1,That time a auto repair shop owner saved me,564

Happened about a year or so ago. so dialogue not exact

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a local shopping centre. Mostly went there to buy some cat toys for my new kitten, but as the main pet store in the centre opened a little later than most other shops (and since ive got OCD and tend to go places early), i did some other shopping first. After i was done it was still about 10 minutes before the store was meant to open. I had nothing else to do so just decided to wait outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

No problem? right? WRONG  


As im on my phone playing a game (After about 5 minutes of waiting) someone pops out of the pet store to tell me ""We open at 9"". ""No problem"" i say, ""I got here early and dont mind working, take your time"".

&amp;#x200B;

So they close the door and i go back to my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Just standing there quietly as the minutes tick by

&amp;#x200B;

about 10 minutes later (which at this point is a little after 5 past 9) a different person pops their head out. same message though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: We arent open yet

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yes, i can see that, im just waiting

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: We open at 9

Me: oh thats okay, i dont mind that youre a few minutes late

Me: yes and its now 8 minutes past 9 (show her the time on my phone), its okay im in no hurry, please take your time.

Lady: YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT SIR I DONT APPRECIATE YOUR ATTITUDE!!! WE OPEN AT 9!!!

The landlord was a nice man from my church who was giving me an awesome deal on the rent and i didn't want to rock the boat. So no baths for me.

As the boys came in I blocked my 3 70lb dogs (two Huskies and a Shepherd mix) from rushing the door to check out the stranger. I turned around to find him on my top step with both the screen door and security door wide open. It looked like he intended to step inside. Um, no.

I stepped right up to the threshold and pulled the door shut behind me as much as I could. It was still wide enough for a dog to get through, and he didn't step back even though I was very much in his space.

I had planned to step outside and shut the door to listen to him, but suddenly I wanted the metal screen door shut between us. I had to lean into him to grab the screen and I said, ""Excuse me please, I need to shut the door.""

He didn't move until I actually touched him with the screen, and in that moment it didn't matter what he was selling, I wasn't buying it from him. He did step back and I shut the screen and he launched into his script.

I walk the dogs after school, and it would be a good way to calm down, so we got ready to go. Perhaps we'd run into Mr. Salesman and I could say something.

We did.

I said, ""Hey. I was trying to shut the door before they got out."" Then all 4 of us rounded the bush on the corner and he could see them. It's quite a lot of dog coming at you all at once, and though we were still about 15 feet away, his eyes widened and he took a step backwards.

Hello all you happy Reddit people! This story took place a number of years ago when my small town was shunted into the 21st century with the addition of a DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNN SUPER BIG BLUE STORE!!

Cue gasps of shock and awe that almost mask the distant sobs of despair...

After many years of quiet innocence our town was introduced to the ultimate representative of American consumerism.

THE SUPER BIG BLUE!

That vast urban oasis of frivolity where one can be guaranteed to find anything you could ever dream of owning. Now our Big Blue, we are told, is not like any other Big Blue in Canada. Oh no! It is the size of two and a half football fields and is the crowning achievement of 2 years of construction and spans the border of our town and the next rendering it impossible to tell which of us can claim this monstrosity as our own! And so when you entered this self-contained urban hive you saw before you, 3ft tall letters proudly proclaiming Welcome to the Town/Town Big Blue!

If that weren't enough to fill any spirit with a sense of impending doom, a friendly greeter with a thousand watt smile will be ever eager to jump out at the unsuspecting innocents and shout WELCOME TO BIG BLUE! while slapping a bright yellow smiley face sticker on the end of your nose!

Now I, like everyone else in our town was keen to experience this wonder of retail so I put on my fancy socks and sallied forth to the town border where the brick monolith greeted me with a neon glow and the scent of floor polish and new tires.

As I stood in the entrance, with my smiley sticker leering up at me, I surveyed the endless kilometres of aisles before me and began to feel the first twinges of fear. This did not have the feeling of a night that was going to go well at all, however, I bravely took hold of my supersized shopping cart and set forth to join the masses of happy Big Blue shoppers!.

The most amazing thing about any Big Blue in any country of the world, is that they are able to find the most cheerfully, perky people on the face of the planet to work for them! It is my firm belief that if the government were to somehow harness the sheer wattage of the required Big Blue smile, we would be able to light up our entire city for a year! Do not let those cheesy grins fool you, however, for indeed they hide brains that know NOTHING about the place in which they work!

The first item on my list was shoelaces. Simple! Thought I. YOU FOOL! Shouted the gods of all things that are Big Blue and laughed as they mocked my innocence! Off I trotted to the shoe department to be met with a rack containing no less than 20 different shoelace styles, types and various shades of brown, dark brown, nearly black, almost black, not quite black , and oh yes! Black!

As I stood in stupefied amazement, a helpful friendly employee in a bright blue vest came zipping by, obviously turbo charged by his required 15 minutes of Big Blue Workout! ""HALT!"" shouted I!. The poor boy stopped so suddenly his soft soled shoes made the noise of tires screeching to a stop!

""Which shoe laces are right for my shoes,"" I asked, while still staring at the rack in confusion. ""Shoes?"" Asked the lad. ""Shoes?"" He then dropped down the floor and stared at my shoes while poking them gently with a finger. ""Shoes!"" and smiled up at me with the look of a puppy expecting a treat. ""Shoelaces!"" He beamed and zipped off again! I stood there scratching my head and coughing from the dust he created from his roadrunner like dash, and finally selected a black - or are they nearly black? - shoelace package and continued on my way.

My next stop was greeting cards. I hesitantly waved down a nearby sales girl , ""Excuse me do you know where the birthday cards are?"" The girls smile faded to a mere 950 watts as she stared at me in great confusion. ""Cards?"" she mumbled, and slowly tuned in circles. Finally she scratched her head, and wiped her nose on the back of her hand and pointed vaguely off down the aisle. ""That way!"" she beamed and zipped off leaving me choking in another cloud of dust.

6 employees, and 2 Xanax later, I finally finished my journey into the 7th level of Hades and began to navigate my way out of the store. This is not an easy task! Oh no! For indeed they do not want you to leave! They want you to stay until you are a wrinkled, hopeless, mummified corpse of humanity curled up in the corner of the ladies fitting room, mumbling something about attention Big Blue shoppers!

But leave I did and as I reached the doors, the greeter smiled her thousand watt smile and said ""thank you for coming to Big Blue do come again!"" I looked at her and began to tremble while some where deep inside me a cry began and soon forced is way out of my mouth while i screamed ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"" and made a frantic dash to the parking lot and freedom!

and with this thought, i leave you with the warning. When a Big Blue greeter beams at you and says ""Welcome to Big Blue!"" run! Run the other way! and DONT LOOK BACK!",1,When the Big Blue store moves into the 21st century - or how I almost got sucked into the void of no return!,2

Boy if you ever want to set random people off, say ""black"" and ""face"" together, apparently. Holy shmoley, you'd think I said the N word in public.

Some lady, who happens to be holding the leash of a black Labrador Retriever, gives a massive gasp, and does the pearl-clutching gesture, before starting in with something along the lines of:

I called and asked what the total had to be for delivery and she scoffed and told me $25 I let it pass and started telling her my order. Each time I finished an individual order(paying all together but needed to know after tax what each meal was and I understand it's annoying but it's a necessary evil when ordering at the work place) she would heavy sigh and huff and puff.

I informed the woman that it would be just a second and that I was sorry and she said, ""okay, where are you located?"" I tell her the grocery store on x street and with the most attitude I've ever heard over the phone she states, ""you mean the one that's walking distance? You want me to deliver to 5 minutes away??"" I said yes please and that other co worker would like wings.

I really wanted to throw attitude at her face, but this lady was going to be handling our food and I didn't want to risk that she'd do something to it. I debated telling her never mind we'd figure something else out but then it hit me.

This bitch was going to be bringing us our food. I got everyone's share. Her tip? One. Single. Cent.

Do I normally agree with this? No. I'm all about tipping wait staff at least 20% and delivery at least $5, even if it's just down the road, or more depending on how far they travel and what the total was.

I debated on no tip at all, but I feel like one penny was enough of a smack in the face. Either that or she assumed we got the total wrong and gave no tip. Either way we won't be ordering there again and I don't know if I'll go in there with friends or family. This isn't the first time they've been rude for no good reason.

Edit: Perhaps I should have clarified, this place only delivers to businesses, it's someone in the back, not even wait staff, who handles the phone calls and deliveries.",1,Uncalled for rudeness and judgement,5

So I went to a sandwich shop I frequent in my city. The name is also a name of a form of transportation. I know the manager there pretty well because a family member used to work there so I got to know them during that time. 

Anyway I got in to pick up my online order and saw a homeless man walk in before me. Thought maybe he was going to use the restroom or just get out of the rain as it's coming down pretty hard today. 

He went up and said something to the manager, not sure what as I couldn't hear him. But I did hear the manager say she would whip him up a sandwich. Which is what she did. 

She made him a sandwich, gave him a bag of chips and a drink. All for free. I was near tears from how amazing this woman is. She has always been a very friendly person but this just showed me how big her heart truly is.

I just wanted to share this heartwarming story somewhere and thought this sub would be a good place to do so.",1,Sandwich shop owner gives homeless man a free meal,23

Now I don't know what exactly was wrong with everyone on Sunday (May 5th) but every customer that walked in was just plain, rude. If I said every bad tale, I'd be here for a good hour or so. 

So during this day, I had a line of people asking for the same thing over and over again. Eventually it got down to where we had no more fruit salad. So this gentleman comes in, asking for said side. When we explained we were out, he was muttering under his breath: ""What do you mean you have no fruit salad. You can't mix up the strawberries, oranges and blueberries RIGHT THERE?""

Now again, remember that this is a cafeteria styled restaurant. Those toppings are for parfaits and other salads. So, being as polite as I could be I closed my eyes and said: ""Sir, if you'd LIKE me to I can get you the strawberries, blueberries and oranges and mix them up as a fruit salad for you."" Stunned, he stares at me realizing I heard him. He then stated: ""Oh wow, you'd do that for me?"" And I just smiled, handing him the fruit.

Well come the day I'm off, me and my room mate go out to eat at a different restaurant. Complaining about how rude the customers all seemed to be on Sunday. Mind you we both work the same work schedule, so this is just a basic routine we do when we're off. Helps get off the bad week and start a new, you know?

Well as I was explaining the story about the fruit salad man. Apparently his son, was sitting just a few booths down from us and had walked over, standing intimidatingly at us and screamed: ""THAT'S MY DAD!""   
We paused, stared at each other and then looked at him laughing. I asked if he was joking and he just, continued to stare down at me like he was about to murder me. Irritated and bewildered, he slowly sits back down and we just eat our meal. I'm trying to brush this off, though I'm clearly pissed. 

But it doesn't end there. The woman who was with him, decided to be the one next in line to come up and ask for my name. I stared at her like she was a moron, because again remember.. We are off the clock. We are NOT working. She doesn't have a right to hear my name, nor do I even know this person. My room mate lied and said a fake name to throw her off, which she then proceeded to say: ""I want you to know that speaking ill of others is very unprofessional and that I'll be talking to corporate. I hope that nobody ever speaks bad about you.""

Beyond stunned, sitting there and staring as this stupid woman walks off... I finally decide to go to my work. Which was ironically, right down the road from where we were eating so that we could warn the managers of this stupidity. These two customers decided they weren't done and the moment I left, ganged up on my room mate. 

Luckily for me, my friend doesn't back down and she bit back at them. Bluntly explaining that they should be embarrassed to go out of their way and make us feel bad. When we're clearly on our day off, just trying to relax.

We shouldn't feel threatened outside of our job. I had warned the manager of these two and we put our foot down that if  they even try and get something out of this, we will not be happy. That was straight up harassment. Needless to say, I'm calling the cops next time I see them.

I live in a fairly small town. Approximately 35K people (give or take) Other than a couple of drug stores, hardware stores and a dollarama the only place to shop for Christmas is big blue. Land of the smiley face where the employees are all dead inside and wondering where their lives went so horribly wrong.

Now this event took place a number of years ago when big blue still had layaway in Canada. One bright October day, I decided to head on over to big blue to do some advance Christmas shopping and put it on layaway. 

So I put on some clean underpants and a t-shirt that actually fit (GASP!) and sallied forth into the bright fall sunshine!. I got to big blue and happily started to peruse the shelves, adding more and more gifts to my steadily growing heap in my shopping cart. 

Decorations! Toys, Clothes, things that sparkled , whirled and made music! All jumbled together in a chaotic pile of Christmas glory! I stared at my pile of loot and patted the top of it gently before heading over to the deep, dark bowels of big blues layaway department.

I stepped through the door and looked around, the one fluorescent light flickered dismally in the ceiling lending a sad, glow to the broken counter and dispirited workers below. Old posters hung on the walls advertising long forgotten movies and the famous sign sagged pathetically on the counter. ..elcome to ...al mart...

I gulped, this did not bode well for me but hey! Christmas! So I skipped over to the counter and began shifting my pile of goodies. 25 minutes later i skipped out the door with my layaway receipt in my pocket, contemplating coffee and maybe a cookie!

Fast forward 1 month. I had gone in each week to make my payments, carefully kept my receipts and now I was ready to pick up my horde! I skipped into big blue while humming Christmas carols to myself, grabbed a cart and danced down the aisle to the layaway desk.

I am here to pick up my goodies, said I. 

Clue blank look from the clerk. You have a layaway? 

Me - (puzzled..that was why i was there...) um, yes? (handed her my receipts

Clerk - snuffles and rubs her nose. We dont have that here.

Me - (confused) of course you do! see! receipts! do please look again!

clerk - nope

Me - (becoming alarmed) what do you mean no! I spent over $150 on this!

clerk - (calling over her co worker) she claims she has a layaway here but we dont have it.

Clerk 2 - (looks at me like i am senile) are you sure you laid it away in THIS store dear? we all look the same you know.

Me - 1. This is my receipt which clearly says THIS STORE. 2. Do not ever call me dear! 3. I am in full possession of my faculties and 4. YOUR MANAGER NOW! (yep i went Karen on em!)

Cue Manager stage left!

Manager - whats up?

Me - explaining everything while trying to maintain my temper.

Manager - (looks at these 2 women like they are both insane) did you bother to look in the box by the cash? (nope) 

In the end, my stuff was found , Christmas was saved and the 2 Grinches were given the option of remedial customer service training or being fired. They chose the training &lt;G&gt;

The waitress first comes up and asks for drink orders, normal stuff and she seemed really nice at first, everything is going well. 
She comes back for food orders and says in a condescending tone ""Do you need some more time?"" Because I had a hard time figuring out what drink I wanted and it took a while, I had started to get annoyed.

I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip pancake combo (chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips inside, chocolate drizzle, chocolate chips on top and whipped cream, and the usual combo stuff like eggs and sausage) I was hella excited bc it was a new item and it looked so good. 

Later she comes and brings bare pancakes and the combo, and tells me ""I figured you wouldn't want the stuff on top"" I say ""Actually I would, I wanted what was advertised, please"" trying not to sound rude or anything, because I wasn't trying to have someone spit in my food. She pushes the pancakes towards me with a smirk, and just walks away, I never got the toppings as she didn't even come to the table the rest of the time, only to pick up our empty plates and give me the receipt.

I was PISSED, the whole time I wasn't even really mad that I didn't get the toppings, I'm not really the type of person to get mad if my order is messed up in any way, I was more mad about the fact that she assumed for some reason that I wouldn't want what I ordered. 

When I later paid for the food, I wrote ""0%"" on the gratuity thing (basically the tip line) and she had the nerve to say ""Why didn't I get a tip?"", I explained to her that she didn't even give me what I wanted, and she never even walked to our table after that (usually as a waitress/waiter, they'd walk to the table, ask if we need refills, ask if everything is going good, etc. It's been like that at every single place I've been to that has wait staff, and the previous times I've been to this restaurant). I wanted to ask for the manager, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of things on my boyfriend's birthday, and like I said I'm not one to make a big deal out of my order being messed up, it's open 24 hours, the cooks are probably tired, I get it y'know. I probably should've asked for the manager though, now that I think about it oof. 

Not really a crazy story and kinda anticlimactic, but it really pissed me off and I wanted to be able to share this with someone

Edit: I do usually tip, even if the service isn't 100% great I still leave at least something, and this was by far the worst service I've gotten. Much worse could've happened but it's still no excuse for treating customers like that.

Another edit: I did check that the toppings weren't just add-ons, rather than just coming with the pancakes themselves, they were supposed to come with, unless you asked for extra. And yes I was billed for all of it, although I'm not sure if removing the toppings would've changed the price in any way.

The t-shirt was around 40 bucks plus around $15 for shipping.

At the time here in Sweden our postal service usually didn't bother charging you VAT/TAX on stuff you orderd outside the EU.

That time i got unlucky and had to pay it. First of all i had to pay a fee witch was about 15 bucks. Then i had to pay the VAT/TAX for the item itself which was around $10.

So that t-shirt got really expensive, total spent 80 bucks.

(Nowadays we have to pay VAT/TAX for every single thing arriving from outside the EU (even if it costs 1 cent) since the customs gave the postal service a hard time for not collecting it.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the happy part.

After getting the t-shirt i was super happy with it. Super soft and excellent quality.

I messaged the company to tell them how pleased i was about it and also casually mentioned that i had to pay customs for it and that i didnt mind it.

I expected them to be happy i bought a t-shirt and maybe ask for a pic.

They got upset about me having to pay customs for it. They ended up giving me $15 partial refound and another $15 as a coupon code for my next purchase.

I didn't expect that so i thanked them deeply.

Love this subreddit and this is my first ever post, so please be gentle. Seen a whole load of apologies for posting on mobiles re. formatting. Personally haven't seen any difference, either on mobiles or computer, but will point out that I'm on my tablet, so apologies for any formatting problems.

A few weeks ago, I broke my watch. My own fault. Not a mega-expensive one, but pretty nice, and it was a birthday present from my wife a few years ago, so didn't want to discard it. The metal strap had come loose from the watch face.

Happened to be at our local hypermarket in south-east London. In the car park, there's a small cabin belonging to a national chain which specialises in watch repair and key cutting, so I decide to see if I can get it fixed. Turns out that one small part is broken. The man behind the counter replaces the part and fixes my watch. Takes about three minutes. I figure this will cost me up to £10, which I'm perfectly willing to pay.

With the fixed watch now on my wrist, I ask him how much. He says ""well, the part cost next to nothing, so just put something in the charity box"". My jaw nearly dropped to the floor (for the record, I put £8 in).

About a week later, I read that this national chain makes a big effort to employ ex-prisoners, to help them with rehabilitation. I have no idea whether this man belongs to this category or not (frankly it's none of my business), but my experience there, coupled with the company's efforts to help society, mean that they will be getting my business in the future.

18,TheNamelessOnesWife,0,t3_bl20ql,105,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bl20ql/grocery_store_trip_cashier_and_manager_wont_let/,"This happened several years ago and still bothers me to this day. I never tell this story IRL but felt like getting it out into the world somewhere. This is my first post to this subreddit and it is a very negative filled post.


For context this was my first trip to a discount grocery chain store. This store had special rules for payment and did not accept credit cards at the time I decided to try shopping there. I looked online to check if my bank debit card would be accepted, it was listed so I thought I was good to go.


Arriving I did not know I had to put in a quarter for a cart. I put in my quarter then picked up a dozen or so items.


At the checkout line the cashier asks me if I have a bag. I did not. She tells me I need to buy a bag and points to a shelf. I don't want to hold things up, I should have done more research, my own fault for not knowing about the quarter charge for carts and about bringing your own grocery bag, but from here on things go straight to shit.


The bag shelf is almost empty, I need to get on my knees and reach to get a bag crinkled at the back of the very bottom shelf. I hit my head on the middle shelf trying to get the bag and knocked the empty shelf off.


There is a pair of people behind me in line who start laughing, ridiculously loud laughing, but I don't react to them. The cashier tells me I'm holding up the line, and tells me to hurry up. No one asks me if I am okay. The cashier stays behind the register expecting me to fix the shelf. I reattach the shelf quickly (to my surprise) and hand over the bag for cashier to scan. I loathe being emotional in front of strangers so I'm doing my best to have no reaction even though I can feel how red my face is.


The total is on the till so I pull out my bank card to pay by debit. The cashier puts out her hand in a stop motion and tells me to use the debit machine to get cash. The pair of people behind me roar in laughter again calling me stupid to each other. I'm counting myself lucky neither of them is pulling out a phone to film whatever they think is so damn funny.


Me: I checked online before I came in. This store accepts my debit card. I want to use my debit card.


Cashier: No. That's a credit card you're holding and we don't take credit.


Me: It says debit card right here. The back of the card has this symbols...and they match the banner (I point to banner hanging by checkout that states payment rules). So I want to use my card.


Cashier: We don't take credit cards. That is obviously a credit card. You are holding up the line.


The laughing pair of people behind me chime in between laughs with their own comments. Saying I'm stupid and I need to follow the rules.


Cashier: See, everyone else knows how this works.


At this point some sort of manager walks up and asks what the problem is.


Cashier: This woman is refusing to pay for her groceries. She has a credit card.


Me: I have my debit card right here. It's not a credit card. I just want to pay but she won't let me.


Cashier: I told you to use the cash machine.


Manager: Yes that's right. For your convenience we have a cash machine located in the store. Do you know your pin number?


I feel like I'm losing my mind, I'm sure I'm still red faced but I don't show emotion in my voice and keep my body language neutral. I'm determined to explain this only one more time and then I'm leaving. That is what I thought…


Me: Why would I pay a fee to pull out cash when I have my debit card that you accept? I have a debit card. If this was a credit card I couldn't pull out cash. Please let me use my card in your machine, the cashier has not let me use my debit card to prove that it works.


I hold the card out in my hand. The cashier puts up her stop hand and the manager keeps his hands at his side. Crazy pair roar out in laughter again.


The Manager and Cashier start repeating their dialogue alleging I have a credit card and I need to get cash from the ATM but I shake my head no.


Me: No. I'm not buying anything, I'll put all this back. (I put my hand on the cart handle which has the groceries in it)


Manager grabs the cart: No, you haven't paid! You are not allowed to take these!


Me, I let go of cart first then say: Uhh...what...I want to put the stuff away so I can get my quarter back. 


Crazy pair pointing and continuing to laugh at me echoes through the store.


Manager: You need to pay for these groceries before you can return the cart miss.


Me: Uh...please let me put everything back so I can get my quarter, I don't want to give your store any of my money now please.


Manager still holding cart: Only paying customers can put away shopping carts. I will not responsible for you taking these items because you can't or won't pay.


At that statement from the manager, hearing crazy pair continue to laugh when they could have just gone to another line, and all the damn looks other people were giving me I simply left. I walked out. Ignoring the Manager and then the Cashier saying something out at me, I try ignoring the laughing pair as scream something about me running away and I am an idiot. I'm MAD as hell that the bastards in that store got a quarter of my money because they would not let me put away things and then return the shopping cart. I wanted nothing of mine to contribute to that store financially so people like the laughing pair could continue to shop there. Now maybe it was policy that things could not be restocked by the customer, but every item was in one bag. The manager or cashier could have taken out the one bag and let me put the cart away. I didn't think of that in the moment.


Once I got to my car I drove not too far to an isolated parking lot and finally freaked out letting out all the crying and rage I held back in the store.


I almost certainly was acting like an emotionless robot with a red face after I hit my head hard on a shelf and being subjected to the constant laughter from the two crazy people behind me in line. I can be socially awkward but I did not deserve to be treated like I was by the employees. Telling me I have a credit card when I don't, while also telling me to use my alleged credit card to pull out cash from my bank from the ATM when that isn't how it works. Refusing to let me get my quarter back from the cart return. The employees treating me as the problem when the pair of people were the ones making a scene.


I have no idea what the laughing pair of people were all about. If they weren't there maybe I could have resolved everything. The worst thing about the whole experience was them. The Cashier seemed unphased by their laughing and was more concerned about those two getting their full cart of groceries scanned and paid for. Logically I know they must have annoyed the Cashier and they are why a Manager came over so quickly. They were two plain regular looking folks seemingly on a normal grocery trip. But the laughing, pointing, insults, and how they would not stop after seeing me hit my head. It would be one thing if they had laughed, then asked if I was okay and offer to help, that would have been acceptable. But all they did was laugh. That's why I would never shop there again, discount prices attracting true assholes who don't care about anyone except themselves.


I'd like to completely forgot about that store but it has become increasingly popular in the area I live. I regularly hear from people how I should go shopping at discount grocery store and it's the best. I tell people I don't like the store and will not ever shop there. Most people don't push the issue, if they do I just say I have my reasons and refuse to explain while changing the subject. 


At the time I went back online to check again if my bank debit card was listed and it was. As a customer I've only been treated badly and unfairly twice, this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had as a customer. It seemed like because I only had a few items to purchase I was placed at a lower value then the laughing pair behind me who had a full cart. The employees were against me, as if they held me responsible for the actions of the pair behind me as I was the object of their crazy laughing abuse.",1,"Grocery store trip, Cashier and Manager won't let me pay, 2 other customers make it even worse",516
19,TheVsArt-andStuff,0,t3_blkdlv,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/blkdlv/my_history_with_bats/,"When I was about 2-3 years old, there was a bat in my house. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember all the details, however, I myself remember hiding under my dad's computer desk, with my older sister. I also remember having to get rabie shots, the bat had given me, my sister, and both my parents rabies. Not much else on that. ( We moved out of that house 4-5 years later, and never told the people that had bought it what happened with the bat. That isn't important to my story, it is just important to me that people know that.) 

Fast forward years later, in Christmas of 2017. I remember much more than the first experience, so buckle up. Down to exactly time it was. (I checked my phone constantly.)

It was 10:11 and me and my fam were playing 5 second rule in our hotel room. I was getting super tired and dizzy, after a long day of opening gifts, talking with relatives, ect. I got into my new unicorn onesie that I had got that morning. (My mom washed it before our trip, and I think to the day I die, I will love unicorns.) I dozed off pretty quickly.

I was waken up at 11:38, to my sister shaking me awake. My mom was running around, having a panic attack, my dad, trying to calm her down. What followed went like this:

Cast-

V- me

M-mom

D-dad

S-sister

F1- front desk lady1

F2- front desk lady2


V: S, what the heck is wrong with you? What time is it?
S(quietly): V, I don't want you to freak out, but there is a BAT in mom in dad's room! 

I felt a whirl of confusion and fear race through my brain.

V: A what?

My sister gathers up some of her things, and I gather some of mine, (my tablet, phone, my pillow, some chocolate I had received earlier, and my glasses) as my mom and dad put leashes on my dogs. One of them was hyper and wanted to go outside and run around. The other dog, was a little shizu, old, and could care less if the building were on fire.

With experience with a bat, my parents put a towel under their door to trap the bat in the room. We went down to the lobby, where 2 young female employees were whispering to each other, and stopped when we approached.

F1: Um, hello... how can we help you?
D: We need a new room. Now.
F2: Why? Oh goodness, is it a mouse?

I'm trying to keep myself from laughing...

M: Oh hell naw, ITS A F***ING BAT. 

It was at that moment, I had never known the human jaw could drop so low until that moment.

F1: I'm sorry, a what?
M: You heard me, there's a bat in our hotel room.
F2: Can we get you a new room?
D: That would be great.

Apparently, instead off calling animal controll, one of the ladies at the desk had called the police. They showed up with animal controll half an hour after we got a new room. Wise cops. 

We got that stay and our next 2 stays at that hotel for free. I honestly couldn't blame the hotel, because they were doing massive renovations, so we were probably lucky it wasn't a Snake or something. When the bat was tested for rabies, we got a message saying it didn't have any. There's where this would've had this be a prorevenge story, because the hotel would've had to pay for our rabie shots. 

We didn't stop going to the hotel after that, as it was an accident, and the gave out free breakfast in the mornings, and popcorn all day. It also allowed dogs. 

I had to post this story because recently, the stubborn shizu died. His name was Joe, and we loved him. I am not taking it too well, and especially my sister. I'm trying to get over it, but it's really hard. Any support people give on this post is welcomed and noticed.

I had been craving mapo tofu for over a week so after driving to a place my colleague had recommended that had already closed for the evening we decided to go to a random little place google maps told us mentioned mapo tofu on their menu.

We got there at about 35ish min before they close. I really didnt want to bother them but I figured that might be enough time to not be a pain. No one was there other than us and I believe an employee eating dinner. A waitress greated us and seated us with menus immediatly, and brought out some tea and water too. she came back shortly after to take our order. (oh and I wont type it but the waitress had a very heavy acent and there was a definite language barrier)

SO= significant otter 

W= waitress

*at this point I see the mapo tofu in the veggie section of the menu*

Me internally: *Oh, thats a weird place to put a pork and tofu dish... maybe they're thinking the tofu counts it as a veggie? Weird.*

SO: *orders his sweet and sour chicken after some questions*

Me to Waitress(W): ""Hey, the mapo tofu, thats the tofu in the red sauce with ground pork, right?""

W: ""Oh, no, no pork, just veggie and tofu""

Me: *insert look of my brain hitting a wall at 100mph*

W: ""You... need more time? Maybe you'd like -*lists every pork or spicy dish I was not at all listening to as I desperatly glanced over the menu*-?

At this point I basically just resigned myself to not eating anything. I figured we already took up a table so I'd order SOs food to go and just tip on it.

M: ""Oh, uhhhhh, no... no, its okay. We'll, uh, we'll just go with what he ordered and, uh, you can probably do that to go and, uh, nothing for me... thanks.""

W: ""You sure? Ok then, Ill bring some hot and sour soup while waiting, no charge on bill.""

SO looks at me apologetically as I put my hands on my temples framing my eyes as I mutter-groan softly (I thought) to him after she was well out of earshot (I thought), ""Man, I just wanted mapo tofu. My gps said they had it and everything and Ive been wanting this for weeks.""

Apparently I'm not as quiet as I thought

W dead stops about 15' away from table and comes back 

W: ""You know what, we chop pork from shredded pork dish and put in tofu. You still want? We'll make it good!""

Me, stunned af: ""Uh, yeah, ok, thank you!"" 

W walked off as SO and I just stared at each other at how sweet of an offer to special order that for us so close to close time. About 5min later she brought out our soup (which I ate all of because so is picky) and about 10 min after that she brings us out these HUGE portions of food. Seriously, we currently have at least 5 meals worth of leftovers in the fridge. 
It gets better: When it came time to pay the bill she brought boxes for our food unprompted, got us fresh scoops of rice to go because she didn't want to send us home with spoiled rice, and also gave us a freeking QUART of the soup because we seemed to like it. At this point SO and I are trading awkward glances like 'holy shit, she did NOT have to do any of this, wtf shes so nice'. 


So I did what any completely sane person would do. I tipped $20 on a $19 order. She gave us a to-go menu so we could look it over if we ever wanted to try anything else in the future and saw us out before going to pick up the tip. As we were leaving she came hurrying out of the restaurant (we parked directly in front of it) to thank us profusely over the tip which I just super awkwardly brushed off like 'oh, yes, no problem, thanks for the service'. Super freeking awkward on my end because as someone with mostly NY heritage who works customer service, I just expect some impersonal level of casual, normal rudeness. Seriously, people thanking and going out of their way like this for me bothers me inherently; I have a problem, send help.

I asked if he would like to talk to the manager, and that’s when the bomb dropped. We was being helped by the manager. We could have gone back and asked for the store number and the number to corporate but being that early, our cares were at an all time low.

22,bluja000,0,t3_bl4cxl,59,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bl4cxl/went_to_the_er_and_was_admitted_but_i_think_im/,"Edit: I wanted to thank you so kindly for the gold, I wasn't expecting that at all. I was posting more as both a rant, and a warning, regarding my experience. I'm hoping that others benefit, as I know that most people don't understand some of their rights while in a hospital. People just accept what they are told, and may actually end up in worse situations due to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently posted here, about changing my primary doctor, due to my diabetic condition. As a brief recap, I went to see my primary doctor about my very high (200-400+) blood sugar readings. I had gone specifically to request that she change my medication, to ones that were more reliable and better suited to my uncontrolled state. I was really concerned, because nothing that I was doing was working, and my sugars had been getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of changing my medication to older, more reliable ones, she decided to add newer medications, including some that weren't covered by my insurance. Not thrilled with this, I ended up going to the local ER, so that I could see if they could help determine what was wrong. They decided that my readings were within reasonable limits (my blood sugar tested as around 200 at the time), and that there weren't any signs of bone infections (I am very prone to them, having had 4 at the time). Because of this, I got sent back home, and just told to get wound care, and see my primary doctor for more care.

&amp;#x200B;

My home health nurse got me a wound care doctor that would visit me at home, and I went ahead and arranged to see a new primary care doctor the next week (would have been last Wednesday). The new wound care doctor would see me that Monday (a week ago last Monday), after I got through with the ER the Friday before (So two weeks ago last Friday). However, that Sunday, I realized that I must have hit my foot against something, and had a massive blood blister (turned out I had two, actually), and my foot wasn't looking nice. However, since I had already gone to the ER, and was seeing a wound care doctor the next day, I didn't go back to the ER right away.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I ended up seeing the wound care doctor, and my home health nurse, that Monday. Neither liked the look of the blisters, but decided to let them try going down on their own. The wound care doctor removed excess skin from my original foot wound, and patched me up nice and clean, leaving some extra padding to allow the blisters extra cushion. It wasn't enough. Apparently at least one of them busted that night, and soaked, and I do mean SOAKED, the padding and cover that they had put on my foot.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up taking a shower the next morning (Tuesday), and putting a light dressing on my foot (which looked really horrible, all bruised, various colors, swollen, just nasty), and waiting for the home health nurse to show up. An hour later, my dressing was soaked, and he had arrived. He thought the discharge was from the night before, not realizing that I had just put the new dressing on less than an hour before. But when he realized that, he took pictures to send to the wound care doctor. Between them, and my boyfriend, and yes, me too, we all decided that my history with bone infections meant that I needed to see the ER again.

&amp;#x200B;

This time, they admitted me. My blood sugars indicated a massive infection (yes, this became bone infection number 5), and the x-rays and other tests showed that I needed IV antibiotics yet again. I spent 8 days at the hospital, with each and EVERY single day having fasting sugars of 375+ (I think there was only one fasting that was 375, the others were 400+). I had to have two surgeries, one to remove part of the ball of my foot, and the second one to help clean up the area and then close up the entire surgery site.

&amp;#x200B;

The miscommunication issues I had were enourmous. First, the hospital doctor wouldn't even think of putting me on enough insulin to try controlling my sugars. At home, I was using at least 25 units fast acting, 45 long acting. It was only toward the end of my week that they started giving me 18 units fast, and 22 units long (twice a day halfway through the week). This didn't stem my readings, I was still seeing, according to my discharge paperwork, an average blood sugar reading of 330 daily. Admitted, this is with the infection, but I never saw any normal blood sugar readings, not even once, during the entire 8 days I was there.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only was I having problems with them not aggressively treating my sugars, they weren't telling me what changes they were putting into effect, or why. I was on a diabetic diet, which was actually very generous. You were allowed to select from a restaurant style menu (you had a list of various grill items, salads, desserts, drinks, etc, like with a normal restaurant. Not like the standard hospital menu of two options and you were stuck). But I'd be allowed to select a salad and chicken strips, with dressings for both. Then, randomly, I was told that I couldn't have dressings for both. No rhythm or reason given, just nope, what you ordered for lunch today, and dinner yesterday, well, it's not allowed for dinner today. Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the menu choices I had. But I generally chose the same things for lunch and dinner (large salad with dressing, chicken strips and dressing, two diet cokes, and maybe a jello or something small as a changeup), and would get frustrated when I would sometimes randomly be told that I couldn't order two dressings, or something else wasn't allowed for some unknown reason.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, there was my pain management medication. Because I have a high pain tolerance, it would take a fairly large dose of pain medication to actually have an actual effect. I'm talking about, something like 20-30MG of percaset or oxy to really control pain. But the hospitals never liked to believe me, and would usually maximize my dosage at 10MG every four hours, three if I was really lucky. So honestly, I never got real pain management, and it honestly never bothered me  that much when they would reduce or remove the pills, or IV injections. It just meant that I was right back at where I started with, controlling my pain through just plain ignoring it when possible. But I had an amputation. Not really fun, but actually not that painful. I guess the neuropathy was working in my favor, reducting the pain to background noise, which I was used to. However, they chose to try to use the pain pills to force me to wear the oxygen nose things when my blood oxygen wasn't at ideal levels. They tried threatening to cancel my pain pills if I didn't stick these little plastic tubes into my nostrils to force extra oxygen into my system. They didn't like it when I laughed and told them to keep the pills. I wasn't going to wear the tubes because I didn't like them, and my oxygen levels were good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

They ended up telling me several different reasons why various staff didn't think I was discharged as rapidly as I could have. Blood oxygen wasn't ideal (94% wasn't good enough?). My blood sugars were too high, which I wholeheartedly agreed with. Should have been consistently 180 or lower, and I was still seeing 400 as my fasting number. Home health wasn't set up. Umm, no, my home health agency was fully aware that I was going to use them, and they were aware of my history and everything. My prescriptions weren't set up. Umm, well, I got a small pain pill script, a ""push"" IV med, and an antibiotic 10day supply, none of which were actually given to me upon discharge. I had to go fill them, and of coarse some had a co-pay. If I hadn't been able to beg a little money off a very generous relative, I wouldn't have been able to fill the antibiotic. Oh, and turned out, my water was shut off the day before I went home, so I had to immediately call the water company and find out what I needed to do in order to have house water, as a disabled resident. Basically, there wasn't a single true reason for me to be delayed on my discharge, except for the blood sugars, which I still don't have under control, days later.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Well, I ended up going to the ER, and due to really screwed up miscommunication and other issues, I think I can honestly get a lawyer interested in suing the hospital. I went in with wildly uncontrolled diabetes, a massive infection which ended up costing me part of my foot, and left missing the portion of my foot and STILL with wildly uncontrolled diabetes. Because the infection can be directly linked to the blood sugar readings that were/are very high (I mean, go to ER, don't pass GO, levels), I think that the hospital can be considered negligent in not aggressively treating my blood sugars while I was there. I ended up going over a LOT of details from my 8 day stay at the hospital, and I think it might be interesting for anyone who has a diabetic family member, or is diabetic themselves, to read over. I wouldn't want anyone to end up going through the same situation I went through, especially if it's not needed.",1,"Went to the ER and was admitted, but I think I'm going to be seeing if I can sue the hospital",16
23,Hexual_Innuendo,0,t3_bko1v1,22,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bko1v1/pizza_not_pizza/," Living  in a city in Denmark I pretty much have a pizza place on every corner, I  can pick and choose from many places  and a huge variety in their  quality of Pizzas. In Denmark there are only a few major pizza chains and only one have seen fit to set up shop in the city I'm in and they closed recently due to a big scandal, so I've frequented a local privately run place near  me which has decent pizzas and more importantly decent salads and  sandwiches as I sometimes buy my lunch from there.

One  day a friend had invited me to concert with his family and him. They  had ordered food from another place for themselves, but because they  weren't sure about my dietary restrictions, we agreed that I just get my  own dinner and because I'm a creature of habit I just went to the pizza  place and ordered a chicken salad.

When  the salad was done, I paid for it, said thanks and was about to leave  when the owner asked me if I wanted a sandwich and at first I was like  huh? He then explained that he had made a sandwich for himself but for  some reason had put bacon on it, which he couldn't eat, so he wanted to  give it to me no charge and because I'm dumb and had dietary  restrictions at first I said no but then he insisted and in the end I  caved and got a free sandwich out of it, so yay!",1,"Pizza, not pizza",308

As we had done something during the day we decided to go to a restaurant near the event. Turned up and everything was great. Managed to change tables so that wife could have a wall behind her to help her deafness. Perused the menu and noted the 5 or 6 vegetarian options that wife could have as starters or mains. Ordered some breads and oils, along with our starters and our mains. Breads and oils arrived at the same time as our starters. Don’t know if that is common but think normally it comes whilst starters are being prepared. 
My main was great. Steak cooked to perfection. Wife’s main was supposed to be garlic and mushroom risotto. This tasted so bland. No garlic and a slight hint of mushroom. The rice tasted like long grain rice. So she sent the dish back and she decided to skip this course and have dessert. 
When we get the dessert menu we um and ah over the eight choices for a few mins then decide. We then noticed there was no (v) next to the desserts listed. So checked with host and she stated that none of the options were vegetarian and they had a fruit salad or sorbet. 
So the chocolate fondant, creme brûlée, pear Eton mess, or the salted chocolate torte, or the cheese and biscuits, or the others I cannot remember all have meat in them!

Place opened at five and we were outside waiting for it to open so we were second in line to dine. Upon entering, we notice most of the area is communal dining. Except for two tables on each side of the entrance and three longer tables near the wall. 

I asked to be seated at one of the two tables near the window, but was told that was for “larger groups”. I was pretty pissed because there was no one else besides a person at the bar, a group of four who had been seated at the other window table, and my cousin and myself. No one else was waiting outside either. Sorry, but this was an example of the notion ‘the customer is always right.’ 

After the waitress told us we couldn’t sit there, we asked about sitting at the longer table against the wall, but the waitress kept trying to get us to sit at the communal bar area (where there are only stools).

I need some damn back support while I eat and just sat myself at the longer table against the wall. (Another waiter made it seem like it was a choice.) I was pissed at this point because it’s incredibly rude to treat a customer (in a near empty restaurant) like that. And no, that table wasn’t reserved.  

The waitress was also rude every time she came to check on us/take our order. I hate cilantro and wanted to know whether what I planned on ordering would have it.  She said she’d ask, but never returned with an answer. She only brought the cilantro laden dish to the table. I sent it back to have the sauce removed though. Anyway, later when I was looking over the dessert menu, the waitress rudely remarked, “don’t worry, none of these dishes have cilantro.” 

Also, there was cilantro sauce on my fork and I didn’t want to lick it off. So I grabbed a fork from the seat next to me and when the waitress came to pick up the plates, she bitched that there were two forks and didn’t know where the came from.  I just ignored her. 

I thought she was just a bitch to us, but later saw her being rude to other tables as well. She threw her hands up after taking the order of another table. And bitched that another group of people left after not being too pleased with the updated menu.

This happened on a trip to London. It was a beautifully sunny day and my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice beer garden to sit in and enjoy the weather. As you can imagine a little bit of sun and everyone is outside in shorts and flip flops and all of the beer gardens are rammed. 

We eventually find somewhere next to the river with a good space and what looked like a long queue. I volunteered (as the Good Samaritan I am) to go get our drinks. 

The place had a pretty extensive cocktail list so when I went inside to order I wasn’t surprised to see everyone ordering fancy cocktails. What I was surprised by was the SINGLE barman making drinks for the restaurant and all of the people queuing from the beer garden. 

Poor guy was trying to make beautiful cocktails as quickly as possible for way too many people. That’s when I saw his boss come up. His boss walked behind him and basically told him he wasn’t working quick enough, everyone was waiting and he was doing a shit job. 

You could see the sadness and frustration on the poor guys face. Making cocktails nicely is not a quick job and you could clearly see he was doing his best. 

When I got to the front of the queue I ordered my cocktails. I then straight up told the guy I heard what his boss has said and that I could see he was working as quickly as possible and just to ignore him. I said I could see they were understaffed and it clearly wasn’t his fault if people were waiting they needed another 2 barmen at least. 

He gave me a lovely big smile, handed me my drinks and said that’s fine and walked away. 

Being the very British person I am I waited for him to come back and take my money. Instead after a minute or so he came and waved me away.

Ive done this about 5 times now and I can really see the differance between the delivery people. 3/5 times they knocked on my door, when i greet them at the door they say ""uh huh"", no eyecontact, just pulled out the recipt to see if I left an online tip when they saw no online tip they scoffed and shoved the food into my chest and left in a huff.

Edit. Dont know if this was clear, im not refusing to tip and the orders usually come out to $16-$18 bucks with the delivery fee and my usual 3-5 dollar tip is 15-30% tip.

I have gone to a store(a “cautious”-way subsidiary)which is the closest one to my house with a gas station, every once in a while when money is tight and I have to use a gift card to keep money available. I literally have the exact same issue with this location every time.

I print out an e-gift card, legal tender, every other “cautious”-way subsidiary in the area has very minimal issue using it(minus an argument or proper useage definition from me occasionally). It’s a gift card, you buy off “online retailer woman”, and are able to use parent company wide. So, three months ago, I had this ignorant worker at the gas station who’s wasted a total of 12 hours of my time {over a 6 month period!!!!!} (8 hour shift with no gift card balance cause she didn’t activate the gift card she gave me as “the only way we can give you the money off the pump, since you used a gift card...” can’t it go back on the same gift card??????????; 15-20 minutes each time she see’s my paper e-gift giving me attitude and fucking up the transaction; gives me attitude and tries to tell me she can’t use the thing when she’s used it before with my guidance, is clearly incompetent, and literal instructions are printed on the GC paper{total order... press EFT full... press cancel to activate scanner........ scan barcode..............}Even told me she was off the clock now that she’d wasted half an hour fucking up not doing the transaction properly one time and kicked me out of the store.) I filed a complaint, was bribed to silence by the company with gas savings, and contacted by the store manager who stated the issue would be handled.

So. To the story. Two days ago I was out of gas after my shift, I made it to the close gas station attached to above subsidiary.... the one with the issues...... so I walked into the STORE thinking... k. Manager would know what to do at least right? So then I can go get my gas after I make sure there was training?

M: Me.

SM: Piece of Shit manager, SM for short.

IA: initial associate.

M: walks up to register with three cans of beer. Waits in line, lets associate ring up items, show gift card and “so this says the instructions....”

IA: snatches GC out of my hand. No words just runs off for a manager...

M: pacing for 5-10 minutes at the register getting fumed because three months ago I talked to a manger about this EXACT ISSUE and was assured proper training would happen.

IA +SM walk up.

SM: I can’t take this cause I don’t know how, but you can wait for the manger who gets in “1.25 hours from now” and they can help you.

M: read this. It’s legal tender and tells you how to use it. Process my items.

SM: I can’t cause I don’t know how, I have to wait for my manager...

M: she just brought you up as the manager. You’re the manager. Do it. Read this. Associate instruction: total, eft full, cancel, scan. Done.

SM: I can’t do it. Sorry. You can wait.

M: no you piece of shit do your job. This is legal tender, read it. It tells you what to do.......

SM: no, and I ain’t talking to you no more.

M: cool. I’ll just call corporate then...

On the phone with corporate, this associate kicks me out of the store for calling him a piece of shit. Then threatens me, while I just got picked up by on the line with corporate. (Ah karma, it’s recorded).

I explained the situation. Still absolutely fucking irate. I yelled at a very innocent woman so many times and I feel bad, so in the off chance you happen to see this cool lady who tried to just stay on point, sorry.

“We can have a district manager call you back when they get a chance but this is an issue with a manager in store and we have no way to control that.”

“Alright... chill then, just escalate so I can go to bed.”

Cops rolling up.

“Thanks have a good day”

M: puts all things in pockets on top of car.

Cop: hey man... what’s going on...

M: explain everything. State all I wanted was beer and gas and this same store has the same incompetency issues every time I walk in and I exploded cause they wouldn’t take legal tender.

Cop supervisor 1 and 2 arrive. Cop explains situation to 1 and 2. 2 goes in to talk to store manager. Whole store lies and states manger said it was against policy................................ ask for me to be 86’d.

They had  Thursday night dinner for 2 special including a bottle of wine.  My wife and I chose the special as did our friends. I ordered the scallops as did one of the other couple and my wife ordered a shrimp dish.
First, both couples ordered the same wine but our server said there was only one cold bottle for the special price so she gave us a ""better""  one to start with. Getting a good feeling about this place!
Our salads came out really quick but our dinners lagged a bit. No problem,  we were enjoying ourselves.
Dinners come out and our server had put in 2 shrimp dinners instead of 2 scallop dinners. Our server came over immediately and apologized and said she had the kitchen cooking my scallops right then.
The manager came over and again apologized for the mistake and offered baklava or cheesecake for the table as dessert. 
It was mostly the way he came over, and introduced himself and made an offer of dessert that made me not mind as much about my late dinner.
Also, he brought the baklava over to the table himself with side dishes so we could all enjoy. It was served with ice cream and had recently come out of the oven.  It was soooo good.
This manager turned a bad experience into a positive.  We will go back.
Too often I read a lot of negative stories here so I wanted my first post to be positive.

I got a suggested contact on LinkedIn.  I couldn't place him for a bit.  I thought maybe he was an old professor.  Then it hit me, he was ""Old Crazy Joe.""

&amp;#x200B;

I got into an accident in November which totaled my car (I was not at fault).  I had only had my car for about a year and a half and I loved it.  I started looking around for the same make, model, and year.  I found one that looked perfect.  It had about half the miles of my old one, an added tech package.  I called my parents to let them know that I thought I had found a great car and was going to go look at it.  They asked if they could tag along and I said sure.   When we got there, we were passed off to Joe. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Joe was brand new there.  He was in his 70s or so, and it looked like  he hadn't updated his wardrobe or hair style since the 80s.  I explained why I was there and what car I was wanting to look at.  He grabbed the keys along with the keys of another similar vehicle.  As we were walking out to the lot, he started telling me all about the car.  I reminded him that I knew about it since that was the vehicle I had had for 1.5 years prior.  As we were getting close to that part of the lot, he starts messing around with the buttons on all the key fobs (two different cars and the one I wanted to look at had remote start).  It was obvious he didn't know which fob was for which car, and he was pressing random buttons on the remote start.  Somehow, we found the car.  It looked great and I was ready to take a test drive, but Joe insisted we look at the other car.  So we left that car and he again started with the random pressing of buttons.  He managed to trigger the remote start of the car we just looked at.   I flagged him down and told him about it, and he looked confused.  He walked back to the car, pressing random buttons on the remote start.  I asked him for the keys and I went and turned it off myself.  We go take a look at the other car and I'm not interested at all.  We go back to the first one for the test drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Joe gets in beside me and my parents are in back.  I adjust the mirrors and pull the seat forward, then go to use the pump which raises the seat (I'm only 4'11"" so I love this feature).  As I'm pumping it up Joe looks alarmed and asked what I'm doing.  I respond that I'm just raising the seat.  He said ""Oh yes, this car can raise the seat which a very nice feature.""  Like, no shit, I just SHOWED HIM THAT.  The rest of the test drive was fairly uneventful.  I loved the car and knew this is the one I want.  We go back to the dealership to start the paperwork.

&amp;#x200B;

We had to wait a little bit for the guy who could negotiate the price.  Joe starts some small talk.  My dad mentioned that he is retired United Methodist clergy.  The guy starts spouting off that he and his wife went to a United Methodist church until ""the damn liberals took over.""  My dad mentioned that he's one of the ""damn liberals.""  Joe stumbles over himself and tries to walk it back and he started a new rant about atheists.  My dad mentions that his son (my brother) is an atheist and is a very caring and spiritual guy.  Somehow Joe gets on the topic of ""the gays"" and I mention that I'm a lesbian.  Joe said that the guy we need will be along shortly and he walks away.  My parents and I look at each other asking if that all really just happened.  I emailed management about this experience and they never responded.

&amp;#x200B;

It's creepy that Joe popped up as a suggested contact on LinkedIn.  His profile is VERY bare bones and didn't even list the dealership as his current job.  He only had one job that said he worked there for 25 years (management for a lighting company) and his high school.",1,Tale from the car dealership,406

the cast:-AC: angry customer

\-ME: \*tips fedora\*

\-SW: sweet waitress

\-SO: store owner

\-GH: giant hero

&amp;#x200B;

lets start with the story;)

&amp;#x200B;

a little bit of a backstory:

(i am from a Island in the Netherlands, its a small community with about 5000 people so everybody knows each other)

my parents are getting a devorce so my mother is looking for a new house, on the Island its hard to find a new house (it took my mother a year), but we finnaly got a house.

so to celibrate that we went to our local lovely cakestore to get some cake.

when we arrived (on bicycle) we sat down and order some lovely cake and drinks.

my mother and i where talking to each other, when AC stood up and angry walked to the counter and the following argument happend:

&amp;#x200B;

\-AC: I want to pay right now

\-SO: is there something wrong sir?-AC: yes, SW was very rude to us about (some stupid reason)

\-SO: oh let me just ask SW what happend

so SW told what happend (something about payment or something IDK)

\-SO: ok its seems like it was a missunderstanding.

\-AC: (starts screaming) THATS NOT TRUE, SHE IS LYING TO YOU.

\-SW: thats not true, i was a missunderstanding.

\-AC: IDK, I AM LEAVING NOW, LET ME PAY!!!!!

\-SO: ok, sure

while he waits, GH comes in to play.

\-GH: hey sur?

\-AC: WHAT?

\-GH: the waitress was ""rude"" to you right?

\-AC: yes, very rude.

\-GH: so why are you rude to them?-AC: (starts screaming again) YES, I AM BECAUSE THEY ARE RUDE TO THEM, AND WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG?-SO: just wait for a second.

\-AC: OK, I AM LEAVING NOW WITH MY WIFE. (he threatens to sue the store)

then GH stands up, this guy (who btw is a good friend of my father) is around 2,10 meters tall (6.88 feet) and blocks the exit.

\-GH: you are not going any where without paying the bill.

\-AC very angrly agrees, he pays and screams: I HOPE YOU ALL DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and then leaves

&amp;#x200B;

apperently AC was coming all week there and everytime he was complaining about the smallest things, so SO was very happy that he left and never would come again.

&amp;#x200B;

after that we all where kind of laughing about that guy because he was so stupid and angry.

&amp;#x200B;

thank your for reading,

have a nice day;)

I figure if I eat before heading to work I can eat my dinner later and I won't be hungry when I leave at 2am. This fast food place was nice up until 3 weeks ago. 

I drive up order a chicken combo plain with Dr pepper. I pay and get my order I check to make sure it's plain before heading out. It's not. I park and head inside. I worked in food service before so I understand mistakes happen. I talk to cashier. ""Hey I asked for plain and this isn't, can I get a new one plain. They fix my order and I head out. Next week, same order this time I emphasize plain and they say it back when they go over my order. I pay and get my order. I check it again and  not plain. the same thing ""hey I asked for plain and its not, can I get a new one ""plain"". Get a new one, thank them and head out. Fast forward to last Thursday same thing and when they go over my order I they say plain. I pay and get my order and check and surprise surprise not plain.

Cashier take my mistaken sandwich  and some old lady employee (OL) come up to the comes up to the counter. I don't know if this is exactly she said because she had a thick accent.

OL in very condesending voice I see you drive up and order and then you come in and argue about plain. You need to be more clearer with your instruction. 

Me: um I did and drive through lady even said it when she went over my order. 

OL just scoffed back into the back. Cashier lady comes back with my food. I check it just to make sure and yes it is plain. I'm not sure what that OL problem was. I just know I don't to have to keep waste 7 unnecessary minutes inside. So for the time being I'm going to stop by food place by work and not by my house. And just for the record the drive through people who took my orders were all different people so I have no idea where the break down in communication was.

I know all the tea about customers not tipping, and blah blah blah. That is why I leave at least 20% if not more on bills whenever I go out to eat. Also, I don’t make a huge deal of things whenever something goes wrong with my experience at a restaurant because most likely, I have gone through the same thing as an employee. I am very aware of people’s feelings and who they are as a person, not just an employee.

I was at a BOWLING ALLEY with my boyfriend. We waited about 10 minutes in line just to speak to someone, because of how crowded it was. The cashier guy never said a word to us when we went up to him, we had to initiate the conversation. Told him it was just two for bowling, and and all he did was ring up our total, that’s it, without saying a word. I paid, and he gave me the receipt. I didn’t even think to give him a tip. So I just signed my name and handed it back to him. He literally rolled his eyes and said “Really?”

I was shocked. I then starting thinking if what I did was wrong. But never once have I heard of tipping a cashier unless they did another service for you as well. All he did was ring our total up. Even if I was supposed to tip, he was totally rude from the beginning.

Idk, am I overthinking? I really don’t want to be a “Karen” but I honestly don’t think a tip was necessary. Like, you don’t tip the cashiers at grocery stores, why would I tip him? 

If I had ordered food service at the bowling alley, then for sure I would have tipped. Even if it was just counter-service. But all this dude did was listen to what I wanted, then ring up the total without saying a word to me. It was less than a one minute interaction.

37,hearteyeskori,0,t3_bjrds3,18,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bjrds3/waitress_put_her_hands_in_my_food_to_tell_me_it/,"This happened about two years ago, in a very well known chain restaurant that’s opened 24/7. Now given the “bad” rep this restaurant gets, my family use to go there every week for breakfast/lunch. This incident was one of those weekends we decided to eat out as a family. 

Since it was the weekend, it was busy but we did get seated and our waitress came to our table in a reasonable time. I do think think was at about noon since I ordered a breakfast item and so did the rest of my family because this would’ve been our breakfast for the day. Everything was going great up until we had to wait over an hour for the food which could easily be explained that it was busy so my family decided to wait it out for 20-30 more minutes. It became apparent that our waitress was nowhere to be found, because we hadn’t seen her since she took our orders. Due to the long wait time, my mom and stepdad wanted to leave because it was getting ridiculous waiting that long and not seeing our waitress. And they are the type especially my mom to be a bit of a “Karen”, usually I would just leave to the bathroom to avoid embarrassment when she’s yelling at workers but actually this time she was in the right (she didn’t yell at them this time). 

After a while, my mom finally sees the waitress flags her down and tell her how long we have been waiting. The waitress was obviously annoyed for whatever reason and went to go to the kitchen to see what was up with our food, turns out they were right there on wherever the cooks serves the food for the waitress to pick up. And since the plates looked similar to what we ordered, my mom and stepdad were eyeing them for 30 minutes. The waitress picks up the food that were right there, and I think my mom and stepdad were hoping that maybe what they were placed on was hot, that the food would be warm. But it was not, it was cold when served to us. 

With the food being left there for over 30 minutes, cold and I think my mom had an item (like potatoes or veggies) that were suppose to be cook but were not. So once again, my mom told the waitress that our food was cold and that whatever item she got wasn’t cooked. The waitress who was already proving to be a pretty bad waiter today, had the audacity to say that our food wasn’t cold. My mom told her that the food has been over there for 30+ minutes and that food is cold, especially mine (I don’t know why my food was a lot more cold than their’s and my eggs were undercooked). So my mom points to my food saying that it is cold and undercooked, and the waitress literally touches my eggs and hash browns with her bare hands kinda like she was searching something to prove us wrong, and still kept up saying that our food was not cold. After that, I lost my appetite and everyone else in my family got their food sent back to be remade. Because of the way we were sat, which was at a table, my mom and stepdad had a perfect view of kitchen (of what can be seen) while I had my back turned to kitchen. So because my mom had multiple mini cut potatoes that were undercooked, she noticed the cook wasn’t wearing any gloves while grabbing at her food to cook it more. And that’s were she drew the line. 

My mom immediately demanded to speak to the manager, at first the waitress didn’t want to until she realized that there was no way of getting out the situation because my mom was pissed. The manager finally came and wanted to know what was wrong, we told that we had waited for over an hour and a half for our food, that our waitress went M.I.A for the hour we were waiting, our food was out there waiting for 30 minutes and when it was served to us it was cold, and that the waitress had tried to tell us we were wrong and try to do so by putting her hands in my food, and that cook had not used gloves when recooking our food. The manager then offered to comp our food and have it right out for us but we declined since we all lost our appetite after seeing our food be handled that way, paid for the drinks and left. I’m not sure what happened to the waitress but I do hope she was just having an off day and doesn’t actually treat customers like that. 


TLDR: Family goes out to eat, we wait for over an hour and a half for our food since we ordered it and waitress is nowhere to be found. Food had been sitting out for over 30 minutes until waitress decides to get it, and food is cold and undercooked. When telling the waitress, she tries to tell us we are wrong and to prove her point she put her hands in my cold and undercooked eggs. We send back the food, and my mom notices the cook doesn’t have any gloves on when he was taking the potatoes off from her plate to recook it. Manager gets called, offers to get food comped but we say no and just leave.",1,Waitress Put Her Hands In My Food to Tell Me it Wasn’t Cold When In Fact It Was,92

I'm at the dining hall for dinner. Tonight they're serving pad Thai, along with various side dishes and some leftover stuffing from the turkey dinner the night before. I ask for pad Thai. I'm not paying a lot of attention as they dish out my food, so I don't notice that there's no pad Thai on my plate until I thank them and I'm walking away. They'd given me stuffing instead. I love stuffing by the way, I just didn't want it two nights in a row.  

Thinking there was just a misunderstanding or that I misspoke, I go back to the serving line and the ensuing conversation goes something like this (S = servers, who are two students): 

Me: ""Hi! Sorry, I asked for the pad Thai and you gave me the stuffing instead,"" I gesture to my plate, and obviously I'm expecting that it'll be enough to clear up this misunderstanding, they'll apologize for the confusion, etc. and I'll get my pad Thai. Quick and easy. 

Nope. 

S: ""...that is the pad Thai""

Me: ""Uh, no, I wanted the pad Thai (I point to the pad Thai) and you accidentally gave me the stuffing (I point to the stuffing)"" 

S: ""Yeah, that IS the pad Thai""

Me: ""...THAT'S the pad Thai (I point again). What you gave me is the stuffing we definitely had last night"" 

S: ""No, this is the pad Thai (they point to the stuffing), that's what they told us"" (Who's they???) 

They're giving me looks like I'M crazy.

Me: ""No, okay then. THAT'S pad Thai. I want THAT (point again)"" 

S: ""You want the noodles?"" 

Me, hungry and just getting frustrated: ""...yeah. I want the noodles""

I was about 12 at the time, and my mom had this friend she would hang out with because we were neighbors. This friend had a daughter that was about 16 at the time, and we would hang out often but that was out of obligation, as our moms were friends.   


One day, we all went out to a little restaurant and are served by a young, maybe 16-17 year old boy. He's scrawny and has acne all over his face, but we didn't mind as he was very polite and made sure we were taken care of, but also quite shy. He brings us our drinks and my mom's friend, we'll call her Gloria. She looks at him, then turns to her daughter and mumbles something. She looks at her with a face of shock and disgust. When the waiter leaves, she turns to my mom and speaks in Spanish.

  
Gloria: How disgusting, I don't want him handling my food.  
Daughter: Mom. Stop it.  
Gloria: What? He's got acne all over his face its like a disgusting pepperoni pizza. We need a new waiter.  
Daughter: I can't believe you! You're so horrible!  
After a bit of back and forth, the waiter comes back. 

Gloria, to our horror, then says to him: Can I speak to your manager?  
The boy, very confused and now scared, asks: May I ask why?  
Gloria: I want a new waiter.  
The boy: O-Oh I'm so sorry did I do anything wrong?  
And I shit you not, Gloria responds in the most casual manner: No, I just don't like your face and I don't want you touching my food.  
The boy looks absolutely destroyed. You could just feel his heart sink, a poor teenage boy who was probably insecure at his age. At this point, Gloria's daughter grabs her arm and drags her out of the booth and yells at her to wait in the car.

""Go back to the car, NOW. We are NOT eating here.""  
Gloria: What??? You can't talk to me like that--  
Daughter: GO wait in the car, you've absolutely embarrassed me.  
My mom grabs Gloria by the shoulder and leads her outside. Unsure of whether or not to follow, I stay seated.  
Daughter: I am so, so sorry about her. Don't ever let such a horrible woman talk to you that way again, I'll pay for our drinks and everything, but we aren't going to eat here thanks to her.  
The waiter, thankfully, was very nice about it all and told her not to worry about it. We've since broken off contact with them, and the daughter moved in with her uncle at around 17.

When I finished graduate school and started my career as a petroleum engineer, I went from being a poor grad student to doing very well.  After working for about six months, I started thinking that maybe I should get a new, nicer truck (manual windows suck).

One day after work, I stopped by a car dealership near my office; lets call them ""Landshark Chevy"".  They claimed to be the largest Chevy dealer in the country and they had a huge lot.

I go in, meet a salesman, and I go and test drive several trucks.  They were all much, much nicer than mine.  We then go in and I ask for a quote on one of them and I let him take my truck to go get appraised for a possible trade in.  

He gives me a quote and the financing terms.  The quote is really high and the interest rate for the financing was 17%.  I started laughing and said that I could get 3.0% or less from my bank.  Unless they would match that, I wasn't interested in making a purchase at that time and would arrange financing through my bank first and then make the purchase.  The sales guy didn't like that and said ""let me go talk to my manager.""

That started a 30 minute process where I got the high-pressure sales effort from about four different managers.  They were demanding that I sign the papers and that I was stupid for not doing so.  This pissed me off and I said that I was finished and asked for my truck keys back so that I could leave.

They said ok and then kept up the high pressure sales pitches.  I asked for my keys every couple of minutes for over an hour and they wouldn't give them to me and continued the high pressure sales.  I became increasingly angry and started yelling for my keys.  They just continued to gang up on me demanding I sign the papers and buy the truck.  

I finally slid the vest I was wearing to the side and showed the Sig P239 I was carrying and said that they were holding me against my will and that Texas law allowed me to use deadly force in that situation.   Miraculously, they then found my keys and I left.

I later was talking to the brother of a friend of mine about it and he said that that dealer was well known for that type of activity.  I also found a news article that reported an average of three 911 calls being made a day from the dealership from people not being allowed to leave and several stories of where the dealer forged peoples' signatures to buy vehicles at extremely high interest rates.  

Fortunately, the dealership and the parent company (which was the largest Chevy dealer in the country) went bankrupt during the subprime crisis in 2008.

In the apartment complex where I used to live, the intercom was broken so they would have to call me when they were outside/downstairs and I would come down. This guy about my age (21 at the time) delivered my food and I was happy. I went back upstairs and put on a movie and had my phone on 'do not disturb'.

42,sapphicpenguin,0,t3_bjkzi8,3,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bjkzi8/the_unsupportive_support_team/,"About six months ago, I bought a new laptop. We'll call the laptop company Spacer. So I bought this laptop and this were great for six months. And then one day, out of nowhere, the hard drive crapped out on me. I kept getting an error message that read ""No Boot Device.""

I immediately went online and tried all the troubleshooting techniques I could find. Nothing worked. It was looking like the issue was with the physical hard drive and that this is apparently an issue Spacer computers can have.

Luckily, it was still under warranty. I contacted Spacer and they had me try some of the same troubleshooting over the phone. Once they were able to conclude it wasn't user error (understandable), they had me send it to them for repair.

I packed my laptop well with plastic bags and some packing material and my mom brought it to the post office (since they always close before I get off work). She verified with the woman at the post office that it was packed decently and the post office employee confirmed it should be safe. Still, my mom got the insurance and made sure Spacer would have to sign off that they'd received the package-- just in case.

A few days later, I received an email about damage to my computer. Basically, my laptop was now out of warranty because there was physical damage. The damage? A tiny piece of the plastic casing in the back corner had separated slightly.

I called them immediately and now my options were to either pay about $275 (about 2/3 the cost of the laptop) to repair the casing and then warranty would cover my hard drive issue or I could try to get my postal insurance to cover it. Now, I read the warranty agreement cover to cover. It says physical damage was not covered by warranty, but it does *not* say it voids warranty for other issues.

Next I asked for more pictures of my computer. They originally sent only two pictures, one a close-up picture of the ""damage"" and the other a picture of the box I'd mailed it in. I asked for pictures that showed the damage and the serial number in the same picture. They sent me more pictures of the ""damage"" and a separate picture of the serial number.

With the unexpected cost, the inconclusive pictures, and the warranty BS, it was no longer worth getting it fixed. Not if they were going to make the process so difficult. I emailed them that evening and said I simply wanted them to send my laptop back and, if possible, wanted the refund I was entitled to per the warranty agreement (which I included a link to, from their own website). They said they couldn't refund me, but may be able to lower the fees a bit for the repair. How generous. /s

I replied that I just wanted my laptop back and wouldn't be using their products in the future. A couple days later, I received a final notice that if I didn't approve repairs, they'd send the laptop back. I again replied that I just wanted my laptop sent back free-of-charge, as I had been told it would be before I'd mailed it.

Finally, a few days after that, I got my useless laptop back. I was able to see the ""damage"" that was so insurmountable they couldn't just fix my hard drive. I get that they have policies, but nowhere on the warranty agreement does it say this is their policy. I felt jerked around and lied to.

And, I'm not saying they caused the damage themselves to try and get money out of me, I'm just saying my laptop was well-packaged and that the ""damage"" seems too clean to have occurred in transit. But I could be wrong. All I know is that their support team is decidedly unhelpful.

During this ordeal, I spoke with my aunt who works in IT. I explained the whole situation to her and she said that she's heard Spacer Support isn't very good. She and my mom also agreed the situation was shady.

And it just sucks because the computer was only about six months old. I could take it to a local repair shop and get the hard drive replaced for $150, but I'm afraid it'll just crap out again because this is a problem with Spacer computers. Instead, I just got my aunt to help me pick out a new computer (with better memory too!).",1,The Unsupportive Support Team,18
43,Freak-A-Chu,0,t3_bj8nhw,64,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bj8nhw/some_people_dont_want_their_phone_plan_changed/,"I posted this on the subreddit 'am I the asshole' recently, and was told it may be a good story for this sub.

Just changed my phone plan today, and it reminded me of a story I have from when I was on my parents phone plan (about 4 years ago).

My parents are definitely.... Old fashioned. To put it simply, they don't want to change something if it already works for them, so when they were offered all the new fancy upgraded plans from our carrier to get them new phones and unlimited data and all the bells and whistles, they would always politely decline and keep their simple call and text contract, with a little data for my brother and I. No big deal. At least not until I was on my own, hours away at a new college, going to a cell store myself to get things worked out. 

I walk in, trying to get a Sim card for my new unlocked phone I believe. No big deal, they pair me up with a representative, we get started. He asks me some questions, in very rude tones comments about how out of date my family's plan was with the current times, and throughout I would just respond with ""well it's not my money, I'm not going to complain."" 

Eventually, he starts insulting me, saying ""nobody's that poor, you can afford this, quit being such a tightwad"". Once again, I claim it's not my money to spend, I'm not going to change my plan under my parents noses. While I'm saying these things he's barely paying attention to me, and is tapping away at his company tablet.

Out of nowhere, guy says ""I just gave your number an authorized user profile for this account, and I'm just going to upgrade your plan through your profile I just created, everyone on the plan will get.... Etc. Etc. ..... For only $20 more a month per user."" 

I stop him right there, and say one final time, ""if you ask me to change this plan again, I'm finding someone else to talk to in this store.""

He looks at me, rolls his eyes, and turns his tablet to me showing a signature block for me to sign for the upgrade. 

I'm pretty heated at this point, so I look around the store to find one guy in a different colored employee shirt than everyone else. Obviously a manager. I walk away from the rude guy to this man, go full Karen mode, walking up to him to explain to him the whole situation, point out my representative and he walks over there with me AND FIRES HIM IN FRONT OF ME. 

And I laughed. Out loud. That might be what makes me an asshole here but man that instant karma was great. 

Manager apologizes, says this isn't the first time this rep has had trouble listening or doing things that wasn't asked by the customer (do they get commission for signing people to plans or something?).

TLDR: Guy lost his job because I complained about him trying to back me into a corner, thinking I was easily influenced; but also was probably the least helpful employee in that store, and wasn't trying to legitimately help me.",1,"Some people don't want their phone plan changed, and it can get you fired.",886

This waitress I had was the rudest waitress I've ever had. I was having lunch with my brother, and ordered a glass of wine. The waitress literally scoffs at me and says, ""Ha, and *you're* old enough for that? I'll need to see some ID."" Then crosses her arms and stares me down. Like, yes, I get it, I look young, but the remedy to the situation would just be to ask for my ID, not make me feel like an invalid human. 

Then she brings over bread. We order. I ask for the strawberry shortcake. She goes, ""I mean I could check if they have it I guess..."" in an extremely rude mannner. I'm thinking... Well yeah lady, it's kind of your job to do that so could ya? 

My brother decides he's gunna skip lunch too and just get dessert. She visibly gets annoyed that we aren't having lunch and says, ""Well since you aren't getting *real* food should I just take the bread back??"" Meaninwhile... we're literally eating the bread. On our plates, like in our hands, it's not like we haven't touched it. So we're confused and are like ....no? We're eating it? 

She storms off and ignores us for the rest of the meal until we leave.

I didn't want to tip her at all honestly, but did my bare minimum of 15%. But seriously, lady, why are you a server if being the minimum amount of decent is a challenge for you?

Edit: Yes, yes, I'm well aware you wouldn't have tipped her. Brother didn't want to cause any drama, and we had places to be, so we just let it go. I did indeed post a review as some have suggested.

My Mom had just had her old Ford Freestyle give out due to it's transmission.  She kept it really nice and the transmission was worth more than the whole vehicle.  The ford dealership was only going to give us $300 total for the car which was in beautiful condition, and with leather seats.  So my dad sold it on the road for $1000 and decided we were going to buy a new SUV.  This was back in 2015 during some of the political rallies.  

We live in a small town were political figures rarely show up, and we are a conservative family so when we found out that Trump was coming to town that day me and my Dad were ecstatic.  We decided we would go and pick up my Mom's new car on the way home from the rally.  My Dad had put on his Nine Line shirt with a black hawk helicopter and an American flag on it.  So we go and show up at the dealership and meet up with the salesman.  He is an old military vet and was very calm and relaxed.  We talk to him and eventually he tells my Dad to go over and speak to this woman while he gets some paperwork settled.  My Dad walks over across the hallway to the other office, and me and my Mom and brothers wait inside.  I wasn't there for it, but here is what happened.

\*My Dad walks up to counter wearing his shirt\*

Dad-  Hey, I'm here to get some papers for my wife's new car.

Lady- Oh alright here... What are you wearing.

Dad- Oh, its my Nine Line shirt.

Lady- Don't even tell me your going to that damn Trump rally.

Dad- Yes I am... 

Lady-  WELL I'M NOT HELPING YOU, YOU RACIST PIG!

My Dad at this point was in shock, he took a step back and was dumbfounded.  The Woman had walked away at that point.  So my Dad walks back up to our sales guy and tells him what happened.  The Dude's jaw drops and he tells my Dad they have a lot of problems with her, but never anything that bad.  The Salesman called up the owner who personally showed up and fired the lady on the spot.  My Dad was unsure if we should buy the SUV there, but we eventually after some coaxing, apologizing, and incentives we bought it.  We went to the rally, got the car and drove home.

This happened about 3 year's ago now. I lived in Michigan and liked using a pharmacy, let's call it Kirkland. At the time I did not have insurance and kirkland was super cheap compared to other places. I am perscribed adderall 30 mgs BID. I go and pick up my script get home and start putting my pill's in my weekly pill container ( i am not elderly, just forgetful lol). Anyways, I get to the end of the bottle ( it's empty) look at the container and I am missing HALF of my pills. I take all the pill's out and do it again, this time counting them. I do this twice and kept counting 30 ( should have 60). I had been on this medication for year's and this has never happened to me before. I kinda panic because I know it's a schedule II medication  and it's going to be a pain to try and sort this out. I call the pharmacy, speak to a pharmacy tech  give her the gist of whats going on. It goes as follows. 

PT: It says right here that you picked up 60 ct.

Me: Yes, I know. But I didn't. I only have 30 of them.

PT: The pills get counted X times before packaging 

Me: I know, But I think someone miscounted.

PT: *sigh* I'll let you speak with the pharmacist. Hold please.

P: This is so and so pharmacist. From what I understand your saying you only recieved 30 pills correct? 

Me: Yes. And there should be 60. 

P: Well, that would mean we would be 30 pills over in our inventory, and we are not. I am sorry, there isn't anything we can do. You should try calling your doctor.

Me: Can I please speak to your manager?

P: Our manager is so and so, he's at lunch right now.

Me: Okay, well either have him call me when he's back or I'll just call the store in an hour. 

2 hours pass and the pharmacy calls me back. Turns out that they did short me. I guess they had recieved orders that day and some how inventory was counted wrong? Idk I don't really understand how that works. But I picked up the 2nd half of my meds,  recieved numerous apologies and what not. Someone told me I could of gotten them in trouble.

My boyfriend and another couple had reservations at this really fancy steakhouse in San Francisco. Our reservation was for 6:30pm and we checked it and told us it would be a few minutes while they set up the tables. No problem we’ll just get a drink at the bar! 

Now we’ve been here before and the bar has always been free for anyone to come in and sit down if there’s a space. They even advertise that you can come in just for cocktails and the hosts told us we could grab a drink while we waited. So we saw some open seats and sat down and each ordered a drink with no problem. 

After maybe two or three sips of my cocktail a bartender approaches our group and asks how long we’re going to be sitting here because they need our spaces for other guests. My friend tells him maybe 5 or 10 mins we’re just waiting for our table. He says okay and leaves. 

After another couple of minutes he comes back and asks us again how long we’re gonna be there. I answer him this time and tell him the host told us just a few minutes. He kind of rolls his eyes and says “Well how long exactly did she tell you??” 

“We’re just waiting for our table to be set up she didn’t say EXACTLY how long!” 

Once again he rolls his eyes and goes away. 

At this point I’m super annoyed. If he so desperately needed our spaces why didn’t they set up a “Reserved” sign or I don’t know tell us before we sat down and ordered drinks?? 

He comes up a third time a few minutes later to ask us again and I’m pretty fed up at this point but this is when the host comes up to let us know our table is ready so we leave.  

It just aggravated me so much! I wish I had said something to management about it. What if there had been a problem with the table and it took longer than they said??

I am a guy who wears makeup, but not the feminine stuff. They have a security guard at this store. I am an Indian guy who has no accent at all  and the security guard is an oldish black man who has a super heavy African accent. The store closes at 9:00 PM. I came into the store at around 8:35. I had to do an exchange. I brought in my concealer that I wanted to return, grabbed the product I wanted, which was a glotion, and then I did an exchange successfully. I wanted to do this before the store closes. The cashier gave me an orange bag with my item and my receipt. I walk back around the store to look around a little more. The security guard was looking at me and I knew he would say something to me. I thought he was getting suspicious due to me still shopping while holding my orange bag of a bought product (Thieves commonly steal things with used bags).

I couldn't understand what the security guard was telling me:

**Security guard: ""Do you know oooomar?""**

**Me: ""Are you trying to ask where I am from?""**

I thought he was asking me for my ethnicity/nationality or something.

**Security guard: ""Do you know from oooomar?""**

Now I am blankly staring at him waiting for him to clarify himself. I'm like wtf in my head.

**Security guard: ""Do you speak English?""**

He was not being rude, but please don't tell me I don't speak English if you cannot even say anything in English yourself.

The security guard finally points to his wrist to tell me something regarding time, so I pull out my phone and look at my time. It's 8:48.

**Security guard: ""We are closing now.""**

**Me: ""I apologize. I couldn't understand you at first.""**

50,OnlyPie,0,t3_bj95la,39,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bj95la/my_optometrist_story/,"Just as some background for this story, I wear glasses and I have been since I was 8. I don't love wearing glasses per se, but, I like them enough. A number of years ago, when I was about 13 or so, my mom said that I should go and try on some contacts. I hated anything in my eyes in general, but I decided to give it a shot. Long story short, I hated it and ended up leaving there crying. I hated it and I got so frustrated with putting it in my eye. We've known this doctor for years and I've never had a problem until this following incident and the one before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to February of 2019. My mom said that I might want to try on contacts again. I was super reluctant, because of my utter frustration and hate of putting anything in my eye. However, I told myself that I should try again. When the time came for me to go to the eye doctor, I told him that I would be slightly interested in trying contacts again. I could tell that he was skeptical, because of the incident earlier, but he said that it would be good for me to try them again. For an optometrist's office, there is usually the part before you meet with the doctor, that you have to have your eyes tested. There's a weird puffy thing that blows air in your eye and I hate that part with a passion. It took me a few tries because my eye just did not want to open. The lady who was the assistant said, ""Oh, looks like we'll be here for a while."" I cringed, because it was such a rude comment to make, but I brushed it off. Maybe she was having a bad day.

&amp;#x200B;

There were some other tests for my eyes, like the one where you look at a particularly blurry image of something and it is constantly focusing. There was this new eye test that I hadn't had before where I guess, they are x-raying your eye(not sure what it is or what it does, if you know, you can comment what it does). It flashed a bright neon green light in my eye and it took me a while for my eyes to stop squinting from it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I met with the doctor in his office, I told him that I would be slightly interested in trying contacts again. I could tell that he was skeptical, because of the incident earlier, but he said that it would be good for me to try them again. He did the other eye tests with the blurry letters to make sure that my eye prescription didn't change. Everything was fine, up until the part with the contacts. The doctor got out the pack of contacts that you can try on. Oh boy. There was a knot in my stomach and I really wanted to get out of there. I told myself that I couldn't be a chicken and if it worked, it would be a good alternative to glasses. So, I braced myself for him to put them in my eyes. I was in there for about 15 minutes and it felt like 15 hours. each time his finger and the contact lens would come near my eye, I would jerk my head away. I wasn't even meaning to, it was just my reaction that I had each time. After trying a number of times, he gave up and he looked annoyed honestly. I was embarrassed and I didn't wanna do it anymore. I just wanted to go home. He said, ""Maybe you can try them on your own here. We have a video that you can watch about putting in the lens; it might help."" I have no idea why I agreed, especially with how I was feeling. I watched the video and another assistant(it wasn't the one from earlier) sat me down at one of their tables and had another packet of contact lenses. Ugh. I wanted to throw up. I kept trying to put it in my eye and my eye just wasn't wanting to cooperate. The lady seemed really irritated and said, ""Hope this won't take forever!"" almost in a passive-aggressive tone. At that point, I said, ""I think I'm done right now. Thanks though."" My mom and I left and I'm glad my mom understood how I was feeling. I said that I will never get contacts because of that crappy experience. The attitude from the doctor and the staff were pretty surprising.

I get there, and most of the colours are pretty full; you can tell that people have been buying the yarn, but the bins still have a bunch of skeins in them. Except the colour I needed. There was an employee (E) in the next aisle stocking other yarn, so I  figured I could ask.

54,HayDumGee2911,0,t3_bin6aj,76,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bin6aj/youre_fing_lying_about_credit_cards/,"Late last night after I finished a shift at my work, I was feeling hungry for a salad; but had no ingredients at home and didn’t feel like preparing one myself if I bought them. A local grocery chain in my state that we’ll call “LoseInc Foods” has a variety of pre-made salads that I enjoy; and decided to stop there to grab one and some other items.

As I finish grabbing my items, I start making my way towards the register, and end up walking behind a woman in a grey hoodie; who for whatever reason looks back at me with a displeasing look on her face (I’m not sure if she said anything as I was listening to a podcast and wasn’t paying to close of attention to her lips). I decide to head down a nearby aisle to give her some space while also just wanting to take my time.

I ended up finding a couple other items that were appealing and finally made my way to the register; and who else do I run into but the woman in the grey hoodie? I set my items down on the belt and patiently wait my turn; pausing my podcast and taking out my earbuds. I recognize the cashier as I frequent the store due to I used to live in this city but moved away; and only stop by after or before work.

The woman, after her items were finished being rung up, inserts her card into the card reader; where the card reader begins to sound off as if there’s an issue. The cashier looks at what I assume is a prompt on her till readout, and politely tells the customer that the reader and the store doesn’t accept credit cards (we’ll get to that in a minute). The woman doesn’t really respond at all for a few seconds, and then angrily slams her wallet into the shelf that the card reader rests on, and starts freaking out and cussing out the cashier saying things like “That’s just fucking peachy that you guys don’t take goddamn credit cards.” “You’re lying about the policy.” “Let me just take the time to transfer money from my card into my bank account.” 

After another statement about the credit cards, the cashier again talked about the policy, and I even spoke up and said “it’s been that way for years.” The woman seemed to ignore both of us, and as she was finishing up what I assumed to be a balance transfer on her banking app, she said un-sincerely to me “I’m sorry about the wait”; which I felt like saying something else, but realized it wasn’t my place and I didn’t want to create a stir (even though I really wanted to tell her to fuck off and apologize to the cashier; not that that really matters now). Eventually she pays for her total and goes about her day.

I finish up paying for my items and apologize to the cashier that she had to put up with that when it clearly wasn’t her fault; and went about my night. Before I left the cashier mentioned the woman came to the register and started throwing and slamming items onto the belt; so it seemed like the woman was having a bad night.

Now for the credit card policy: I have no clue how long the policy has been in place for, but for the 5 years I’ve been coming here, the store has never taken credit cards (I found out the hard way myself, and was completely understanding with the cashier); and it’s not like it’s something that they don’t let people know about. Walking into the store, there is a giant ass sign that mentions the policy and how they don’t accept cards due to large fees. At each register, even self-check out, there’s a smaller version of the sign/policy near the card reader. There’s at least 2-3 different areas for people to see this policy; but obviously people can be so oblivious to their surroundings and not notice things.

I get that shit happens, especially when it’s happened to me and caused an inconvenience, but still...just because of your lack of awareness, reading comprehension, and/or planning to have funds in your account or to transfer everything to your debit card ahead of time, that doesn’t give you any right to treat a customer service employee like shit. It costs you $0.00 to be like that, and it’s not hard to be a decent fucking human being; even if you’re having a shit day. The majority of us customer service workers have to do it semi-regularly, even after putting up with bitch-ass people like that one customer I encountered.

TL;DR: I stop at a grocery store, run into a woman who gives a bad first impression, run into them again at the register only for them to get irate at the stores no credit card policy; even though it was her fault for not knowing or noticing the blatantly obvious policy for the store.",1,You’re F***ing Lying About Credit Cards!,512

But before I get into that: obligation requires I inform you I’m on mobile. English is my first language but I couldn’t give less of a f*** about grammar so don’t @ me. 

My grandparents and I have a in ground pool. We built it when practically no one had them so we had these ugly brown tiles along the rim and a few on the steps. We decided back in January that we were going to change those tiles now that we have more options that actually look nice.

We eventually decided on some blue, green, and brown tiles so we could have variety(and because I’m the favorite and that’s what I liked best) and we went to a local place, dunno the name it was never on the side of their trucks which in hindsight is a huuuge red flag but eh, and they said it would only take them a week to redo them. That was back in early March. We thought “Yeah we(mostly me) can swim on my birthday the next month!” Oh how naive of us.

A few days after they were supposed to start(they waited three days before actually starting) and I’m home alone thinking that maybe just maybe they’d show up. I woke up early. 7:00 am is really early for a college student but I woke up early to make sure they can’t get in the house. They didn’t show up until 2. They worked for two hours, blew a fuse in our outdoor kitchen, and left at 4.

2 to 4. TWO HOURS!

The next day they did it again but the day after that they didn’t show up at all. This process continues for two weeks until my grandfather called and got on their case.

Before I continue I should tell you a bit about my grandfather. He’s very well known here in our tiny town. Very well known. He’s also a big dude and looks intimidating. When he’s mad, you effing know. He won’t yell. He won’t raise his voice. But his tone changes. Instead if it’s happy tone it’s more demanding. I’ve only ever seen him yell once and that was because I almost got T-boned trying to learn to drive but that’s another story.

Anyway he got on their case about it and they showed up at normal hours but still only a few days a week. Then they didn’t show up at all. They left a mess in the pool including a whole trash can and they still weren’t done getting all the tiles out. It had been four weeks by then and they still weren’t done.

We were upset. They ended up coming by on a weekend we especially didn’t want them coming in because my five year old sister was visiting and they finished the job in three hours. THREE HOURS! IT TOOK THEM A WEEK TO GET THREE HOURS OF WORK DONE LIKE WHAT?!

Now this normally wouldn’t have been a problem but we have three dogs who don’t understand that there’s no water in the pool and end up sliding down to the deep end and not being able to get out. We had to move them to the front yard. And on the days we assumed they were coming, we have to keep them inside. We basically had to rearrange the dogs’ entire schedules just to work around these guys for five weeks. We can’t put in a piece of plywood or something because we don’t have one that long and there wouldn’t be enough room anyway since they put a pole in the ground right in the middle of the deep end(something about the pool coming out of the ground or something). Our pool is an odd shape too so a cover is out too so there’s no way to protect them.

TL;DR: they said in early March or late February that they’d have the pool done in a week. It’s now late April and I still can’t swim in my own pool.

Edit: They’re back after supposedly having finished and I have no idea what they’re doing. I’ll upstate again at some point

Edit 2: They broke the pump to the pool. -_- I was panicking thinking they were stealing something from the shed but nope they broke the pump and they’re coming back! Yay! Congrats to me on having to deal with them on the weekend I’m supposed to be getting Hibachi with my grandparents as my birthday dinner. Delayed for yet another week.

57,girl_that_lurks,0,t3_bigb9n,14,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bigb9n/thats_not_what_i_ordered/,"Bare with me please, I'm not good at telling stories and money is not in dollars. (TL:DR at the end because some lazy dude once complained about it). 

So there's a few ways shrimps are cooked, the one I love and could eat daily is called ""Camarones al mojo de ajo"" wich is basically shrimps fried with garlic. The popular way of cooking them is called ""Camarones al ajillo"" wich is shrimps fried with chilli. 

While both words sound somewhat alike, the first dish includes ""Al mojo de"" so it's impossible to confuse them. Well, around 80% of the waiters seem to thinks that it's the same dish (or just don't give a damn and assume I'm ordering the most popular way of cooking) and always bring me the wrong dish, wich I (and anyone, really) can't tell is wrong because the chilli is red while garlic is white. 

So last week I went with my parents to this restaurant in some kind of fair. The place gets crowded at 3pm so we chose to go there around 6pm, after the mayhem is done. Sure enough we arrive and there's only 3 tables with people, almost 3/4 of the place empty. The waiter (MW) led us to a table right next to a huge speaker (I couldn't even hear myself) and before we couldn't say something left. So we got up and move to one of the almos 15 tables free and away of the speaker while trying to find him to tell him we were here. 

Almost 15 minutes later he was nowhere to be found. I know we changed seats, but we could see the table he left us at and he didn't return there so we flagged a waitress(FW) and started ordering. The second FW starts taking our order, MW appears and scold us ""I left you over there, why are you here?"" to wich we respond that we couldn't hear a thing, he left before we could say something and we weren't gonna be suffering there when the whole place was empty.
MW said something to FM who left and MW took our order.

My dad asked MW if dish1 was good and MW said not really. What about dish2? MW didn't like it. And dish3? Nope. This went on for a few minutes until my dad asked what did MW recommend and his answer was the most expensive dish in the menu (about $1200 while the others were ~230). Go figure. My dad ordered dish2 and MW spent another 5 minutes trying to convince him to order the expensive dish, failed miserably. My mom ordered dish2 as well and you guessed it: I ordered shrimps with garlic.

25 minutes later we had to call FW because we didn't have our food yet and MW was nowhere to be found. FW apologized and went looking for MW. He appeared 5 minutes later with our dishes. The moment I see my dish, I know is wrong: the shrimps are covered with red dust. I touch one shrimp with my pinky, taste it and yes, that's chilli.

I tell MW that I ordered shrimps with garlic and he said that's the dish. I tell them that this has chilly and it's the wrong one. He starts arguing with me and I tell him that I don't care what he says, that's not what I ordered and I'm not gonna eat it. He scuffs and takes the plate with him. 10 minutes later FW appears with my (correct) dish and apologizes for MW's attitude. 

We finish eating and asked for the check wich, this time, MW brings within seconds. I check it and it's about $1000 total, but there's a $98 charge for service. I asked MW and he tells me it's the tip. HELL NO!

I tell him that adding the tip to the total it's illegal and I could report him and the place would be closed before the day ended (wich sounds harsh but true) (also it wasn't a suggested tip, and my dad was already calculating the tip over the $1000 total). So I payed exactly $902 and left.

I know there's a whole debate over tips but I'm not gonna tip someone who did a horrible job, I don't care how lousy his salary is.

TL:DR Our waiter tried to sell us the most expensive dish, ignored us all the time, got my dish wrong and argued with me about it. Didn't get a tip.",1,That's not what I ordered,88

Hot commodity I know.  We arrive fairly early and take our seats. We sit through all of the ads and then the trailers.  Fast forward 25 minutes into the movie and this pack of teens comes shuffling in trying to sit in our seats. One of them very quickly says “can I see your tickets?” Sure, no problem. She then points out that we’re seated in the opposite set of seats and we’re actually supposed to be in the same seat number but in a very different row, closer to the screen. Ok, that was totally my bad. I read things wrong and will rightfully give you the seats you reserved and move to the seats I accidentally chose. It sucks but that’s life. Make mistakes and own up to them. We still have a decent enough view and my son is still happy just getting to see the movie. Fast forward again to about an hour and a half in to the movie. This group of teens are being loud, laughing inappropriately and over al being obnoxious to the entire theater. Of course I was annoyed, but I also knew that if I reported it, they would just claim I was pissed about having to move, so I stayed quiet and enjoyed the movie. Within 15 minutes another patron gets up and goes to get an attendant to speak with the rowdy group. They settle for a while but start right back up again shortly after the attendant leaves. This same action is repeated 4 more times with various people leaving to talk to attendants before what appeared to be management coming in to speak with them. The management quieted them for the longest amount of time but they still got back to their antics within 25 minutes or so. At this point there’s only like a half hour left of the (3 freaking hour long) movie and nothing has settled them. They essentially distracted a PACKED theater from the movie without any real consequence. This just irks me to the bone.

I’m shopping with my dad at a department store with a coin in its name and we finally decide on two items. The store is fairly empty, my family just came back from the food court and the employees are all very kind-so an overall pleasant experience.

All this changes at the counter though. The cashier scans my items and our card is declined. The cashier suddenly states that it’s because we don’t have enough money.. to afford the transaction... which was $40. I know for a fact it’s not because we don’t have enough credit (I always check before going to the mall due to my deathly fear of embarrassment) , and having worked in customer service before I know that some cards just don’t work on the first try - wether it be pressing the wrong button or taking too long. So, as politely as possible, I ask if we can try again. At this, he mumbles something about it not working anyways but obliges- declined again. The employee sees this and says once again, but angrier, 

“it’s because you don’t have enough money to afford it in your card- try another one or leave! How much do you even have in your card anyways, can you afford $40?”

Now normally, my family is extremely nice to workers because we know it’s a stressful job, but we had been nothing but polite to him thus far and so I say- still calmly:

“We do have enough, for your information, but I’ll use another card anyways”

This transaction goes through , and I thought that would be the end of it, but when I arrive home to try out the new clothes, I see that this employee didn’t even bother to take out the ink sensor (the plastic device that prevents stealing) on the clothes! I’m beyond angry because now I have to drive to the nearest location to remove it-all because an employee couldn’t do his job correctly .  

I guess this story is overall tame but my family and I still feel insulted nevertheless and I’m also hoping I can lodge a complaint somehow.

I saw another post about a bad doctor and switching your primary care physician. So I thought I'd share my story as well. 
  
When I was 14 years old my saint of a Primary Care Doctor switched to strictly pediatrics. So my Mom chose a new doctor. 
 
Well being a young girl I didn't know that the things that happened weren't acceptable, or that I had a choice to switch doctors. Here is the list of things that finally at 23 made me kick this particular doctor to the curb. 
 
1. I was on the boys wrestling team in high school. When I went to the doctor to complain of knee pain. He scolded me for ""being silly enough to be in a boys sport"" and that ""girls aren't meant for that kind of physical activity.""
   
2. When my periods were so heavy I couldn't go to class without having to change my tampon every hour he put me on birthcontol. The pill lessened the heaviness but prolonged my period to 15 days. When I complained he shrugged and said he already put my on the pill there was nothing else to do. I didn't know until college I could just change types of birthcontol. 
   
3. I was diagnosed with anxiety and after that any and all ailments were chalked up to me being anxious and dismissed. 
   
4. Had an untreated sinus infection I went in for three times. Each time I was told I just had a cold go home. This weakened my immune system and made me miserable for a month or longer. When I went to the emergency room because of a bladder and ear infection I was told I had a sinus infection. Three days of antibiotics later I was perfectly fine.

I  never thought of posting this here til I saw someone else rant about a doctor, thanks that person. This event changed the course of my life, but I want to preface this story by saying that I currently work in healthcare, I have a huge amount of respect for my countries free public healthcare system and it has helped me endlessly, a part of the reason I did not get better care or a second opinion was due to my Nmother and enabling stepfather and as an adult I now know how to utilise our health system to its potential. It was also 20 years ago...

So, I'm 12 in final year of  Primary school in my country, I had always excelled in track and field, trained hard and often, dreamed of representing my country one day. I have never broken a bone before, this is important later, and at some point during the year my right hip became uncomfortable. I complained to parents and we went to the GP, he put it down to 'growing pains'. I would stand and sleep awkwardly, walking felt odd, the biggest lightbulb 'something isn't right' moment was when I was training for 200m, I had always started on my right leg and for some reason it didn't feel natural, so I switched to my left, and lost the race (came second). I was devestated because the whole run time had felt wrong, like my body wasn't doing what I told it to. At this point, months after the first GP visit I ask to go again. He pokes around, notes that I do physical activity and puts it down to a sprain, then growing pains again. This goes on for several more visits, I don't possess the language to describe what was going on due to having never broken a bone so all I can say is that my leg doesn't feel attatched properly, Oh how right I was. Meanwhile competition season starts. I'm doing cross country, triathalon's, and everything track and field. My hip is getting worse, as is my performance, I'm getting angry and abusive at competitions, am labelled a poor sport and ostracised from my community, one of my sports teachers said something nasty to me, I can't remember exactly what it was but it was something about getting out of practice. So I trained more at home, running several Km's every day. By the time the school year was out I'd decided that god was punishing me (I went to Catholic school) and I wasn't meant to be a runner. I'm ashamed about my behaviour and stop complaining. Then high school starts, (public not catholic), by this time I have developed a severe limp and immediately get noticed by bullies who follow me around imitating my walk. It has been 1 year since my first symptoms. My mood deteriorates, I start using drugs, decide that there is no god because I have not been a bad person and the whole thing is a crock of shit, and continue limping around until the end of the year. Over the holidays I asked to go to the GP again, I am a pissed off teenager now, and insist there is something wrong (my main motive was to stop the bullying). He orders an X-ray like we couldn't have done this 2 fucking years ago.

So the X-ray is taken in the afternoon, the next morning, 7AM the GP calls mum, tells her not to let me eat and an ambulance is on its way. I had a SUFE Slipped upper Femoral Epiphysis, basically the top part of my hip joint had shifted (very basic description, please google for more info). It is a condition that occurs in puberty but more often affects obese people which was my GP's excuse for ignoring it for so long, I was, and still am, light. it wouldn't have been a big deal, had it not been left for 2 years. I had emergency surgery to insert surgical pins to hold my hip in place, both hips, as it often affects both. 

I have since had another 4 surgeries on my right hip but it has never been the same, I never re-entered track and field, I never walked properly again, I never found a passion for anything else, but I also never believed in god again so thats a plus. Oh and the doctor ended up working in a methadone clinic so fuck him too.  

I know that in some countries I'd have been worse off, first world problems and all, but I'm still pissed and thought I'd share.",1,Doctors indifference alters life immeasurably.,40

One is a 911 service that’s pretty fast paced, and the other is a non-emergency transport service where we don’t stay too busy. About a month ago I was working my non-emergency job, and I realized I didn’t bring my cell phone charger with me. We weren’t busy at all that day, so I told my partner I needed to swing by a store and pick one up. We got to the massive chain store, parked the rig, and walked inside. I went to electronics department, and he walked over to the outdoors section. 
Now, my uniform at this particle service is a red button up shirt, black tactical cargo pants, and black boots. Absolutely nothing like this store’s uniform, but whatever. So I’m standing there looking at chargers trying to decide which one I want, when I hear dumbpsychobitch “DPB” for short clearing her throat in an obvious attempt to get my attention. I turned and looked at her, nodded my head, and said “How are you ma’am?” Then turn back towards the chargers. The craziest shit I’ve ever witnessed.
DPB: Well I’d be better, if you’d stop shopping on the clock, and do your job.
I slowly turn my head back towards her with my mouth hanging open in complete disbelief.
Me: Lady, what are you talking about?
DPB: I’m talking about how I need help, and your lazy ass is shopping instead of helping me. I’ll give you one chance to help me find what I need before I find your manager, and have you fired!
Now I know I could’ve just explained that I don’t work there, and probably ended it there, but this bitch needed to learn her lesson.
Me: No, I’d rather you just go find my manager.
DPB: What a piece of shit!
She storms off and I finish picking out a charger, and about that time, my partner walks up. I tell him what happened, and he says I must be exaggerating. That’s just too crazy. Just as we’re turning to go to the register to check out, I see DPB turning down the isle with a manager in tow. 
DPB: That’s him there! The big one with the beard! I want him fired immediately!
The manager looks extremely confused at this point.
Manager: Ma’am, I’m sorry for the confusion, but he doesn’t work here. Our uniforms are blue. He’s wearing red.
At this point my partner and I bust out laughing. And DPB’s face turns as red as our shirts, and she starts SCREAMING at the manager!
DPB: Then I want him thrown out of the store! I have never been treated this way before! Fuck both of you pieces of shit!!!!
Manager: Ma’am, they haven’t done anything wrong that I can see, but if you don’t lower your voice, I will have you removed from the store.
The lady turns and storms off while still yelling about how unprofessional this is, and how she’ll never come back to this store.
The manager apologizes to us and I tell him what started the issue. He thought it was hilarious, and laughed about it, then walked with us to the closest register to check out. While we’re checking out our radios go off for an emergency transfer at the hospital about a mile away. “Female patient 24 weeks pregnant in preterm labor, needs to be transferred to a higher level of care.” We rush out to the ambulance, and as soon as my partner puts the truck in drive, a car stops right in front of our parking space and DPB jumps out phone in hand, filming herself acting like a damn fool.
DPB: these are the assholes that embarrassed me in the store! I will not let them get away with it! I want your names and your manager’s number right goddamn now!
I roll down my window and lean my head out.
Me: Ma’am, our unit number, and company phone number are on the back of the ambulance. You’re more than welcome to take a picture of it while we drive away, but we have a call, and don’t have time for this. Please move your car, and let us leave.
DPB: I don’t give a fuck about your call! Fuck you prick!!!!
Me: Lady, I just told you that we have a call. If you don’t move your car I will call the police, and have you charged with obstruction of EMS. I’m not asking you again. Move your damn car!
As soon as I mention the police, she walks back to her car (still cussing me) and gets in her car and reverses it so we can leave. I call my manager to give him a heads up.

 I was just shopping in the fruit and veg aisle minding my own business listening to music, as you do when shopping on your own. However I do notice a worker looking around, a little panicked. It's got nothing to do with me. I don't get involved. That is until I notice this lady watching me weigh my veg right over my shoulder.

And she says ""Well, these tomatoes are on a 30% discount, but when I weighed them, they didn't have the reduction.""

I'm like ""Okay, did you check the number?""

""I did check the number! And the number was the potato one!""

I just want to finish weighing my stuff so I do, but I do go through the list with this lady still next to me, I finally show her the tomato number on the screen but she goes:

""But that's the normal price not the reduction price, and that worker won't even help me. She says she doesn't work in this aisle, and doesn't do labelling.""

I look at her ""Well if she doesn't work in this aisle (the fruit and veg aisle, ie fresh produce), or labelling then she doesn't work in them and can't help you.""

Then she gets aggressive ""But I'm a paying customer, she should help me and go over to the help desk instead of me.""

""But lady, she doesn't work in this aisle, and she doesn't work at the help desk. I'm guessing she shelves things, so she can't help you.""

And it goes back and forth for a while before the lady just looks at me with disgust because I'm not siding with her bs. I just walk away. I really wished I told that poor co-worker that the lady was wrong.

Our team decided on the steakhouse in town because we had a great time there last year and it was one of my favorite places in town for brunch and late-night drinks. I called the week before and made reservations for our party of 11, and when they asked if this was for a special occasion I told them who we were and what we were celebrating. I show up first and it is clear that the staff was not prepared for us, but they pushed a couple tables together while the rest of our party trickled in.

I ordered a draft beer, my recent usual, and my boss ordered the same because I had been raving about it. A few minutes later, the server returned to inform us that they did not have that beer (still printed on their menu and he did not mention it when he put the order in), but he brought a can of a similar type of beer and I ended up going with that one, and it was great. I noticed that the server called all of the women and girls at the table ""young lady"" - for the men and boys, he alternated between ""Sir"" and ""Bro"". We order 3 appetizers for the table as well. My boss' daughter had ordered a Coke at the start, and we had to ask for it 3 more times before it got to the table. 

Our server came out probably 15 minutes after we'd ordered our entrees to inform us that the kid's chicken fingers were coming out too dark because they'd changed the recipe and so they would not be available tonight and would the kids like something else instead? Well it's dinnertime and they're hungry, so yeah, they would like something else. They decide on Mac &amp; cheese, Cheeseburger, Hamburger. 

The entrees starts to come out and it looks great. Unfortunately the food is  brought out in two rounds with 5 minutes in between, so half of our table is politely waiting for the other half of the party to be served while their food grows cold.  Finally we all have our entrees and we're ready to dig in. One of us asks for steak sauce and our server literally whips out a bottle (trying to channel his inner Tom Cruise in Cocktail?) but he instead dropped the steak sauce bottle on the full trippel glass and it SHATTERED and chunks and shards of glass flew everywhere. The base of the glass landed on the floor several feet away, to demonstrate the force of the impact. One of us had the good sense to whip out a phone and shine the flashlight app over the table - it was covered in pieces of glass of all sizes, and the shards glistened like snow over everything. 

One man in our party was cut by flying glass and was bleeding, and the staff did not bring bandages or make sure he was okay; luckily one of us had a band-aid in our purse. He had to ask for a new beer since his had been obliterated by Fancy Hands. We had to ask the server to remove the entrees that were covered in glass and beer, and we had to ask to have the meals re-fired. We also notice that one of the kids had ordered a hamburger but had been delivered a cheeseburger AND a whole lot of attitude when we brought this to the server's attention. My boss finally digs into his steak once everything has been cleaned up and everyone has been served entrees sans glass, and his medium-rare-ordered steak isn't even cooked to rare - it is what I know as ""Pittsburgh rare"" or ""blue rare"" - but he chooses not to bring this to the attention of the server or staff, and they certainly were not asking us ""How is everything?"" or ""Does anyone need anything?"" at this point. 

The manager came over at least 10 minutes after the incident to say ""whoa, that was crazy"" - he did not apologize or try in any way to make the situation better. He did not ask if everyone was okay, he did not ask if we needed anything. He headed right back to the bar after his weak-ass cameo at our table.

Our server dropped off the bill without asking if we wanted any dessert - we did want dessert- so we had to flag him down to order 4 desserts and have those added to the tab.

Okay, whatever, honestly we all still had a great time and enjoyed each others' company thoroughly. We were all very gracious and lighthearted throughout the whole meal, despite the shitshow. I was thinking that the restaurant had \*surely\* comped some of the tab, but I did not want to be tacky and ask my boss while we were still there. So I asked him the next day at the office, and I was \*shocked\* to learn that NONE of the food was comped - not a single entree, appetizer, or dessert - and the standard locals discount was only applied to food and not the entire bill, which is different than their standard operations (before this incident, I was a regular). I was seriously in disbelief. I still am and it's been well over a week now. I have worked in several restaurants and can confidently say that everywhere I've worked would have absolutely comped some of the ticket, and a couple of places I suspect would have comped ALL the entrees.

TL;DR: At a celebratory dinner, our server broke a glass and shards ended up in our food &amp; drinks and on our bodies, and the restaurant did not offer a single comp AND shorted the standard local discount.",1,"oh, you didn't want glass shards with your steak dinner?",1029

It's also surrounded by a lot of bars in a semi-residential neighborhood in a big US City known for an island prison. I'm currently not drinking, but I could tell this customer was not sober. 

The only thing you need to know is that this woman looked like a prostitute, based on her outfit,  which is unusual for this side of town. I also assume she's not a local, which will come up later. She's also two customers behind me. 

When it was her turn, the customer put her phone against the window as if she was too good to talk to an employee at Sandwich Queen. The employee didn't speak a lot of English, so she asked her something. There was a little bit of back and forth. Then this:

C: What's a bag fee?

(My City has a mandatory $.10 paper bag fee for all fast food and any kind of grocery store, whether it be a large one or a corner liquor store. It went into effect at least six years ago, which is why I assume she's either from out of town or new to town.)

C: Can't I just get plastic?

At this point, another employee came to the window. Jet English was great.

E: No. We don't have plastic. It's either paper or we give you the items individually. 

C: Fine. I'll be back with ten cents. Damn. 

She ran down the block as my number was called. Weird thing was she had a credit card in her hand so I don't know why she needed a dime. 

I took my food and left, so I don't know how it ended. I passed her on the way home, and she was leaning into the open window of a  suped up Mercedes. 

It's not the best story, but it left me with a lot of questions. I also have no problem with sex work as long as it's consensual. No shame in paying your bills.",1,1:30am at Sandwich Queen,0
68,anklebeard,0,t3_bhv1kp,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bhv1kp/previous_post_deleted_so_here_it_is_again_with/,"Hi again, A*****-

I noticed you recently had a look at my LinkedIn profile and I guess I’m stumped as to why you still haven’t responded to my email. You remember the email, right? It’s the one I sent in response to yours, which confirmed you still had all my legal documents on file, the one begging you for information with regards to how, as one of my father’s designated Powers of Attorney, I might be able to access his equity line of credit to ensure he does not fall out of escrow on a potential new home. What about the follow-up I sent you a few days later, begging for a phone call? Either of those emails ring a bell? 

I found you on LinkedIn too. In a fit of exasperated sleuthing after being ghosted by you and having no other means to reach you directly, I searched for you online. I discovered you work at the xxxx Friendly office and was able to find a listed phone number for that location. Imagine my surprise when that phone number was found to be inoperable. 

Let me make clear from the get-go here that I have abandoned any fantasy that you, anyone from the Legal Document Processing Department, anyone from the Executive Customer Relations Group, or even CEO XXX himself (yes, I have attempted to resolve this situation by forwarding various emails to what may, in fact, be a bogus email address since – big surprise – I have received no response) will help my family and me with this extremely time-sensitive and life-altering situation. Luckily we have another avenue to pursue, so it is no longer dire that someone in the black hole that is Friendly respond to me. Many customers, I imagine, are not as lucky.

I imagine you and “XX” (that’s what he’s called, right?) also have parents or families of your own. I’m blessed in that I have two wonderful parents who have taken great care of me all my life. Now, at 40, one of my core values is to be able to help care for them. They are 91-years-old and almost 78-years-old, and I feel like they’ve earned it. 

Part of the process of caring for my elderly parents was obtaining Power of Attorney for my father through all the necessary legal means in 2017 so that I could help him and my mother with issues just like this: selling their home and moving them into a more appropriate space. 

As you are most certainly aware from my previous emails, part of doing that entailed that we access my father’s home equity line of credit. Because that money exists for just occasions like these, and it’s sitting there. They only thing between my family and that money has been Friendly. 

Banks like numbers, right? What about Friendly? You guys pretend to be a bank – do you like numbers? I hope so, because I want to share some numbers with you.

29: The number of phone calls I have made to various Friendly phone numbers over the course of six business days to try to resolve this issue. 

19: The number of times I have been asked to provide my father’s personal information, including his first and last name, social security number, and current home address.

13: The number of times I’ve answered correctly my own social security number, my current home address, the last four digits of my phone number, my mother’s maiden name, and the make of my first car.

8: The number of months ago I provided Friendly with the notarized proof requested of me to evidence that I am, in fact, listed as one of the Powers of Attorney for my father. 

And here are a few other numbers that might be of interest to you and anyone else who might have the pleasure of reading this letter:

XXXXXXX: The case number I was given at the start of this week.

877-XXX-XXXX: The main Friendly Customer Service phone number.

800-XXX-XXXX: The phone number for the “XXX/Friendly Team” 

And I will spare both J***, who was kind enough to respond to some social media noise I made, and T*****, another excellent employee in the Executive Customer Relations Group, from announcing their phone numbers here. For the record, J*** works for the Auto Loan arm of Friendly, so I’m not quite sure how he was supposed to be helpful.

I’m wondering if you can imagine how helpless you would feel, during such a peak critical moment, trying to wait on a customer service representative who apparently only exists in the ether and on their own timeline to reply to you regarding such essential business.  

What about how you might feel when, while working against the clock, you are suddenly told your father’s account is “on hold due to suspicious activity?” 

How might you, as somebody in the world, respond to learning that a customer service representative would reach out to your 91-year-old father regarding the origin of this “suspicious activity” and “within two business days?” Isn’t that odd, that potential fraudulent activity would be allowed to continue until someone from Ally has the time to finally call the account owner and try to set things straight? 

Well A******, I guess that’s about it. I sure do appreciate any possibility you have read this far. Not really sure what I’m wanting from you all at this point. Don’t worry, once the sale of my parents’ house goes through, we won’t have business with you anymore. I suppose I find it therapeutic to write letters about poor customer service as this is not the first time I’ve done so, and it probably won’t be the last. What can I say? I get this trait from my father.",1,"Previous post deleted, so here it is again with some edits made: Here is my recent experience with Friendly Bank",2

This is where I stop Tuesday’s and Thursday’s to pick up my lunch. It’s normally pretty busy when I get out of class a little after noon but I’m used to long waits in there it doesn’t bother me. 

Today I wish I sat in a long line. Instead I walked in to find a pretty short one, much to my luck since I’ve been having a really shitty time these past three weeks. Simple things like short lines can make you feel pretty good when you’re this damn down. 

The man in front of me had different ideas. He proceeds to order 4 foot longs. The lady behind the counter is obviously annoyed at this and so am I but whatever. They go through, put all the meats and cheeses on then toast the sandwiches. Right as I’m about to give my order, he cuts me off mid sentence and proceeds to order another sandwich. Worker lady has to make his sandwich and I’m back to waiting. 

By the time I finally get my sandwich made, he’s halfway through getting the vegetables put on his five sandwiches. This man takes up close to ten minutes getting all of the vegetables on his sandwich because he’s gets pretty much every single god damn one besides cucumbers. By the time all five of his sandwiches have been officially made, there are no more vegetables left except for banana peppers, jalapeños and cucumbers. At this point what was looking to be a ten minute trip to get my sandwich has now lengthened into 30. 

As he’s paying I simply burst into tears, my sandwich has long since grown cold and I had no vegetables to put on it so I get to eat a sandwich with chicken, provolone and mayo. It was embarrassing to be crying over a sandwich but I had just spent 20 minutes crying to my professor and all I wanted was a god damn sandwich and to go back to my apartment. 

The guy looked at me really guiltily as the worker ladies tried to comfort me, they even gave me a free cookie but the guy just booked it out of there as fast as he could.

Customer: “Thats perfect.”

Associate: “Alright, here you are. That will be $30”

Customer: “What?! I have a coupon that says fabric quarters are 10 for $10!”

Associate: “Yes, that is for our fabric quarters. This fabric here is $30/yard.”

Customer: “Well you just cut my fabric into quarters so that should qualify for the coupon.”

I am a non english native speaker from Europe so sorry for some things. 

Backstory: My grandparends are that sort of people that are require some high standart, specially my gandpa. He was back in the day some kind of high class guy and is still now to some point.  
So fastfood is a no go for them.


One day my brother and I wanted to go to K. when we stayed at our grandparents house. They only know MD and BK cause K. wasnt a big thing here at that time.

So we convinced them that this is a kind of  restaurant.

We drove to it and stepped in. They looked for a seat and we sit down. My brother and I wanted to go to the counter and order something but they said that we should wait for a waiter. After 15 min or so one of the staff came to us and asked if its all ok cause its weird to come to K. and didnt oder just sit. 
My grandpa said they want to have the card (menu) and want to order. 

You could saw in the face of him what he thought. So he must explain to my gandpa that he must go to the counter and order there what he want. My grandpa refuses and said something like ""This is a restaurant isnt it? So we want the menu now."" So me and my brother pushed him off the Seat grabbed them like Kids do when they want something and go with him to the counter. 

There we ordered some chicken. My grandma got a salat. Than gandpa was stunnes that we got the food on a Tablet without plates, fork or knife. So he wanted at least fork and knife. For luck they got some plastic forks &amp; knifes there.

I was shitting bricks because it was actually them as they confirmed my ID information. New businesses are also placed on a probationary permit to sell and are told to expect phone calls if there are issues. In my state, most departments that interact with business are hot garbage that dont care about you and are happy to hand out fines like candy. I was expecting something annoying or my permit to be revoked.

That was not the case. They were just calling to see how I was doing. They wanted to confirm my information to make sure I filed correctly so I wouldnt get fined and I wasnt going to lose any money (it was definitely the government and not a scam). It gets better. They then referred me to free consultations and workshops in case I had any questions and needed any help with filing. They also spent some time on the phone with me asking about my future plans and pointed out a few things I missed and told me where to find the right information as well as offering to help me when I got to that point in my business.

73,carmelacorleone,0,t3_bgusyt,81,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bgusyt/my_stepmom_the_karen/,"My dad, step-mom and little brother came down for a visit last year and since I live on the beach they wanted somewhere with fresh seafood so we went to this pricey little spot right on the water. There was a wait for indoor seating but no one minded so we waited. About fifteen minutes into our forty-five minute wait my step-mom starts complaining loudly about having to wait, and how she kept seeing people leaving, how it was bad service, it was rude, blah blah blah, they could have at least offered us free drinks or an appetizer or something for making us wait. No sense trying to explain to her that August on the Atlantic Ocean means that all the restaurants that still serve fresh, local catches are probably going to require patience. I could tell the host and the bartender who were near the little seating area were sick of hearing her complain, as were we.

&amp;#x200B;

We finally get seated and our waitress comes to take our drink orders. We don't see her again for about forty minutes. We all have our cellphones and they're busy so we're not too upset about the wait, except for step-mom, who again begins to loudly complain about how our drinks have never come and how she's getting sick from hunger and she just wants to get our food so we can leave, how the whole night's been ruined. Funniest part (for me) was when she started complaining that they were so busy because of all the tourists. No 1: the three of them are tourists as well. Just because I grew up in that beach town doesn't make them local by extension. Being forced to deal with way too many tourists as a local I don't wanna hear someone who is part of the problem complaining.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, our waitress finally comes back. She's red-faced and shaky and acting nervous. She starts apologizing, explaining that the table behind us, who we had watched leave in quite the hurry, had actually dined and dashed on a $700.00 order and she ran after them to make them pay. When they started arguing with her she called the cops and waited for the cops. In her confusion and in the upset she forgot to ask another waitress to cover her tables. The cops came and she had to give statement, which took a while. But the cops got the dashers to pay for their meal so that situation ended well. But she was nervous and upset because of the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

We order and our food and drinks come rather fast after all that. After our waitress leaves my step-mom continues complaining, despite our pleas to give it a rest and just enjoy the time spent as a family and her food, which was amazing and definitely worth most of the wait.

&amp;#x200B;

End of the meal comes and our waitress had applied a thirty percent discount to our meal and thrown in an amazing dessert for free, all due to the wait. After all this my step-mom tells my dad ""don't leave that woman a tip, she doesn't deserve one, as long as we had to wait and wait. She could have at least given us our drinks before she ran off.""

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is a push-over and very non-confrontational just went along with it to avoid an inevitable argument. My step-mom is a nice lady but when she gets annoyed or angry she can be insufferable. She doesn't like being proven wrong in a situation where she previously complained and tends to continue acting slighted even after the fact. Fortunately she really only gets this way when she's tired or hungry, every other time she's really nice. She just gets Hangry, which isn't excuse, just an explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I had my own tab because I ordered wine for myself while dad and step-mom teetotaled and little brother was only 12. My bill was only around $20.00 for the wine and one mixed drink but I knew the bill for the four meals was around $250.00. I only had $40.00 in cash in my wallet (after the price of drinks) but I left it all for the waitress along with a note apologizing for my step-mother's complaints and the lack of tip. I also vocalized as we left how good her service was despite the shaky start. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know $40.00 on a $250.00 tab is shoddy but I hope it kind of made up for it in some small way. I'll never find out because Hurricane Florence came along just a month later and that restaurant got destroyed, like so much of the town.",1,My Step-Mom the Karen,857

My family went out to eat as we do every Wednesday, to the same place we always go. This place is a fish place that has a special Senior Day on Wednesday and my grandma always loves a deal. So today, my grandma couldn't come with us as she was visiting cousins but we went anyway because its basically a tradition by now. When we got there, I ordered the food because I usually order it with my grandma and (this is important) I spelled out what literally everyone wanted to the cashier. Then, we sat down and waited for the server to bring over the food. When the server came over I recognized her because she's the one that usually takes our order. Then I noticed that they hadn't brought over my mom's. 

We sat for at least 15 minutes after this girl said ""Your food is coming, sweetie"" before my poor mother finally walked back up to the counter to question them. Their answer completed blew me away. They ASSUMED that my mother wanted something different than what she ordered and didn't think to ACTUALLY ASK HER for the entire FIFTEEN minutes that we had been sat there! Of course, she had wanted what we had ordered! That's why we ordered it! Then my mom, who has the sweetest disposition and rarely ever gets upset, got so frustrated with these people she actually started crying while explaining to them that what she had ordered was what she wanted.

They all didn't seem to understand that very simple concept though and it took 10 more minutes for them to finally get her food to her. All of the workers kept looking over to my table and I gave them all the stare because they had upset my mom so much with their incompetence. By the time my mom came back over to the table with her food, she had gotten a refund but she didn't really care about it at that point. 

My mom has vowed to never go back to that restaurant ever. I don't blame her. I never want to go back either.

I'd been to this shop once before to see a different barber when my hair was much shorter, and my simple request for a high skin fade had been a success. I let them do what they want with the top, and it looked good. 

This time, I was getting a trim from the owner. He asked what I wanted, and I showed him example photos. I explained that I want to grow my hair out from a pixie to a bob, so I wanted my longer top layers left alone and not thinned out at all, and everything below my ears trimmed short, and a tidy/crisp hairline around my neck and ears. He asked me to show him some of the photos again, asked further questions, and I assumed we were on the same page.

Almost immediately, he chops an entire inch off the top of my head. Not like, a little half centimetre to keep my ends healthy, he takes an entire inch off. Then he started thinning it out, and shaping it all to sit completely differently to the way I'd explained I wanted it. I'd said to leave everything above my ears mostly alone and to just shorten the lower part of my hair, and he was shortening everything. 

I asked him again, politely, to keep as much of the length above my ears as possible. He told me it would make me look like a mushroom, and he was giving me a more 'streamlined' look. I told him I knew that, but I'm trying to grow my hair back into a bob so I actually want that mushroom look, awkward as it is. I can pin and style it myself so it doesn't look too bowl-cutty. He disregarded me and said this would look better, and to trust him.

He did my neckline the way I'd asked and it looked fine, thank god. It was shorter on top than I'd wanted but at least it wasn't scruffy at the back. But WAIT. He then proceeded to shorten the hair on the entire back of my head, and cut an angled fringe, and then whipped out a bunch of products and gave me this spiky, short pixie cut look. Never once did he ask me how or WHETHER I wanted these things done.

It's a good haircut, but not at all what I wanted, or asked for. It's nothing like my example images. And it's completely screwed over my plan to grow it into a bob. The barber shop plastered my trim all over their Instagram, and the people in the shop were super complimentary about it so I felt powerless to get upset about something that *does* look good. I now have to start growing my hair out again from scratch. To say the least, I'm never going back there.


TL;DR - My barber freestyled my haircut and did everything completely differently to how I'd explained I wanted it, with example images. Instead of an in-between pixie/bob look, I've been given a short punk pixie cut, because he didn't like what I'd asked for and insisted his idea was better.

Without greeting me at all, she answered the phone. Then she checked to see if a pair of shoes was available by typing in a sku number the caller read off.

Then she started trying to figure out which store on the list was closest to the caller. This went on for several minutes..

Last week I went through the drive through of a certain American Fast food joint that completely dilutes the meaning of tacos and burritos but I like them. So I go there from time to time.

It should be noted that I am a vegetarian. I'm a 'I don't care vegetarian' - I don't care what you eat just leave me alone type of person. This is mildly relevant. 

So I order my usual and set the bag to the passenger seat and continue driving home where I intend to eat my justly gotten goods. Only to discover after I arrive home that one of the items is the meat version. I discover this after taking a bite.

Ok. So it was a long day. I was expecting to just relax and eat a burrito. But that wasn't going to happen. And for some reason, I just got irked and I called them. It wasn't because I expected then to fix it because I want wasting another hour to drive there and back. I was just irked and needed to let them know that.

So I called, explained the reason for being mad, exclaimed a few expletives and hung up. All while the guy was trying to figure out what happened and offer to fix it.

I felt awful. I felt justified because I want the guy who made the mistake but I didn't help anything. And the guy probably went home feeling kind of bitter and resentful. Thinking about that made me feel worse.

I had a reasonable guess on who it was based on the voice and having visited a few times, so today I returned and sought him out. And apologized. He didn't want to even admit that the phone call happened until I stated that I wanted to apologize..but then he admitted that he remembered the exact expletives that I used. 

And then I apologized again. And handed him a five dollar coffee card to hopefully prove it.

And then he tried to fix the burrito mistake. Unbelievable. I declined because I was there to fix what I did...not their very likely honest mistake.

I hope he goes home tonight not bitter.",1,A Bit Of A Twist,28

I was the first one there and since I rarely go there except maybe two or three times a year, I was really indecisive and took a while to decide. It was really slow so I was asking the barista for her opinion on the two drinks I was indecisive on and apologized because I was a little frozen up with choosing so I just randomly picked one. At that moment she asked if I had ever tried the other one, and I shook my head no. She told me “You know what? I’m just going to buy you some so you can try both.”  I exuberantly thanked her and told her she’s the best!

I’ve heard about people doing kind stuff like that for other people but when it happens to me it just really made me so happy; and it came at a great time emotionally for me to have a stranger show they cared.

Let me keep things simple(ish). So let's see...

Me .. The magical pink unicorn 

SG.... scary guy

C... cashier

Still here? Wow! Ok yay! Here we go!

I was at my local grocery store one night buying the foods because that's what you do in the grocery store. The aisles here bright, the fruit was fresh and the oldies station was blasting 99 Luft Ballons over the loudspeaker. 

I was happily perusing the rice, trying to decide between beef or chicken (decisions decisions!) When a strange guy walked up to me. Now I am not just talking strange as in stranger... I mean this guy set off my creep radar in a huge way. He came up close, touched my arm leaned in far too closely.

SG - shopping are we?

Me - ( thinking um dur?) Pulled away and said um...yes? (Ya ya I know I am freaking Will Shakespeare)

SG- (creepy smile) I can show you good things

Me - (creep-dar is blaring alarms) no thank you I gotta go!

I scurried down the aisle and turned up the next one...and SG was back!

SG - why not come with me , my car is right outside. I am security you can trust me! (This time he grabbed my cart)

Me - NO! Please (I am so Canadian) leave me alone! 

I yanked my cart back and hurried off. When I got to the next aisle... he was there again! By now I was feeling stalked but since I only had a few more things to grab,  I figured I would just hurry and leave. SG followed me the entire time...until I got to the cash. 

I put my foods up on the happy counter  and while I was being rung through mentioned SG to the cashier.

Me - do you have security here tonight?

C- yes of course , why.?

Me - does he look like (describes SG) 

C- uhhh no , why what happened?

Me- that guy followed me around the store, grabbing me and  tried to get me to go with him. 

C - (turns white) denim jacket? (Yup) longish hair? (Yip) wait here. Scoots off to talk to the real security guard. Comes back a few minutes later. 
Ok we are searching the store but he may have gone. He has been in here before trying to lure women.

Me - ohhhh crud (feeling more than a bit freaked)

C- do you have a car? 

Me - (random family member) is coming 

C- please stay inside until they come in and get you. 

I sat in the cafe seats while they searched the store and thankfully my ride came in and got me. 

Now our grocery store has uniformed security so we are able to easily recognize them!

83,Tesatire,0,t3_bg58x5,30,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bg58x5/assuming_that_im_difficult_is_just_going_to/,"I have major respect for people that work in the service and retail industries. I worked retail as a kid and know it is hard work. I know that the back is not a magical storeroom and that 99% of sales associates are genuinely trying to be helpful and a LOT of customers can be major pains. 

Recently, I took my son (12) to our local Bulls-Eye department store. He has been DYING for wireless headphones and saving everything he earns in order to buy them since I outright refused. If it's not a birthday or holiday I generally refuse to buy him more glamorous things - it's my attempt at teaching self-control. However, if he saves his own money I allow him to do what he wants with it. So, he saw an ad about the headphones for sale and he could afford them earlier than he expected. So off we went. 

We looked through all of the electronic aisles to try to find the headphones but couldn't find them. I was also looking through the empty places to see if I found the label but no stock – which would explain our failed search attempts. I couldn't even find the label though. So after about 10 minutes of deep searching I decided we needed to ask for help. I sent my son along to ask and the associate said that they were in the area we were looking. 

Now, my kid is really bad at asking questions to adults. He gets nervous. I pressed him to tell me exactly what he asked and found out that he asked ""where are your wireless headphones?"" 

I laughed then walked to the associate. Smiled and started the convo. Me = Me. Sales Associate = SS.

Me: “Hi. (Smiles) I was wondering if you could check to see if you have and brand, style wireless headphones in stock. I know they’re on sale but we couldn’t find them with the rest of the headphones.”

SS: Looks up on his mobile device thing. “No, sorry it looks like we are out.”

Me: “Okay. No problem. Are you able to see if they have any stock in the other – “

SS: Still looking at his device “No, whatever we have is on the floor sorry.” And he turns away.

Me: Started to trail off because I heard the word No, he turned away from me and I started to walk away and tell my son he is SOL. 

At this point, I realized that he cut me off so he didn’t even realize I was asking if he could see what the other Bulls-Eye store had in stock that’s about 3 miles down the road. He assumed I was asking him to check in the back instead and just told me nope. 

Me: I turned around and walked back to the guy. “Hi, sorry, one more thing. Would you mind giving me the number for that store so I can call myself to confirm? I don’t mind driving there.”

SS: “Oh… well. Ummm.. Which store?

Me: “The only one I know of is on Other Street, which one did you check? Is there another?”

He doesn’t answer and starts pressing a bunch of buttons on the device he was looking at before and humming and hawing. Then he moves 3 feet forward to look it up on the actual computer. 

SS: “Oh, it looks like they actually have 3 in stock right now, would you like for me to put them on hold for you?”

Me: feigning surprise “Oh, I thought you said they were sold out. Yea, if they have some then absolutely.”

He started turning bright red, my son started getting excited because he thought he was going to have to wait again and wouldn’t be able to buy them at the cheaper price. I hadn’t told him about checking on a rain check yet. He only gets little bits of nugget at a time or he won’t absorb it.

My kid wound up getting some headphones and is over the moon.  But when I left that store I was irritated with the guy, why couldn’t you just let me finish my sentence? I did absolutely nothing to signal to you that I was going to be difficult. I was polite, I was patient, I smiled and I have never had someone literally turn away from me. It’s not like he was super busy either. He was just standing there looking into the electronics section waiting to be needed.",1,Assuming that I'm difficult is just going to actually make the situation difficult...,819
84,GreatZampano1987,0,t3_bggebg,52,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bggebg/oh_im_sure_you_want_to_tip_me/,"It was around 9pm, I had just driven 7hrs, and I was hungry and tired. There's an Italian place a few blocks from my house that closes at 10pm so I figured I would place a pickup order online for some dang 'sghetti and meatballs. I was feeling basic as fuck.

Before I left, I called the place to ask if they could throw some parm in the bag so I could cover my shit in snow.

ME: hi I placed a pickup order and just wanted to see if you could throw a side of parmesan in the bag.

GIRL: yeah...you could have just asked for that when you came in.

ME: oh...um...ok... does it by any chance come with a side salad? (A lot of italian places do that)

GIRL: no.

ME: oh ok no worries I just figured I would - *click* she hangs up

So I brush it off just thinking maybe they're busy. I work in the service industry too, so I understand that it can be difficult to always maintain a cheery demeanour with customers when shit hits the fan.

I get to the place and go up to the side of the bar that is designated for pick up orders. The whole restaurant is empty except for one family eating at a table. The girl behind the bar is wearing a snotty face that definitely personifies the voice on the phone.

ME: hi i'm here to pick up that order. * points at the one brown bag on the counter *.

GIRL, making exaggerated facial expressions in an attempt to patronize me: oH sO gOoD oF yOu To CoMe! HeRe YoU gO!  * makes that wide-mouthed, squinty-eyed, fake smile people do when they are trying to be aggressive through their teeth *.

ME: ...is everything ok?

GIRL: OOH of course it is,  * looks at the receipt and says my name as she hands me the bag *.

ME: ok...where do i sign?

GIRL: nothing to sign! Have a good one!

ME: oh, but i don't have cash and I want to leave the tip.

GIRL, extremely facetious at this point: oh don't worry about it! I'm SuRe you'll just get me next time, right!? I'm SuRe you really want to tip me!

(I should note that I have only eaten at this place once. Dined in and definitely tipped at least 20%, as I always do. Again, I also work in the industry)

ME, completely confused and frustrated: look, can I just buy something cheap with my card right now so I can leave a tip?

GIRL: doooon't worry about it,  * says my name loudly *.

ME: no, i want to leave a tip. Seriously. Just let me buy the four dollar bread basket so i can leave a tip.

She finally agrees and walks back to the open kitchen. She makes a joke that is in inaudible to me and all the cooks look at me and laugh. I'm just standing there...trying to fucking tip her. She slowly saunters back over and drops a small ToGo box on the counter. The receipt is printed and I scribble out a huge tip. At this point I'm kind of shaken and just want to get out of there.

The girl gives another one of those fake smiles and says, ""Byyeeeee.""

The food was horrible. No sauce at all and the meatballs were burnt; like that kind of burnt that only happens when you overcook something in the microwave.

Not going back to this place.

EDIT: I tipped because I work in the industy and my conscience wouldn't let me sleep at night if I didn't. That's just how is. I don't understand the culture that has been created of tipping on pick up orders, but I'm not going to be the asshole. I'd rather be called an idiot and a moron on this already toxic social platform than an asshole in my own neighborhood.

2nd EDIT: Remember, she didn't do anything that was wrong in a concrete way. Nothing I could prove anyways. She kept it all under the guise of being overly nice. If I didn't tip her, I would have looked like I was in the wrong. Jesus, chill out people. I'm sure you would have handled the situation perfectly.

86,bluja000,0,t3_bgcu5z,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bgcu5z/update_to_im_changing_my_primary_doctor_epic/,"Ok, this is an update to my original post ([I'm changing my primary doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bewdy6/ill_be_changing_my_primary_care_doctor/)). Apparently there were many people who sympathized, so I'm just writing an update for everyone. Hope this makes sense. I'm also doing this on my computer, NOT a phone. I'm usually good at catching typos and such, but it's easy to miss one or two. Speaking English as well, so no excuse if I screw up grammar or spelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so on with the show. As shown in the first post, I decided to change my doctor. I can't see her until May first, and it's going to be a different doctor from who I wanted (my bf's doctor, works in military and civilian medical fields), but this new lady apparently got good reviews. I'm going to request completely new referrals from her, including one for a diabetic specialist, along with complete bloodwork.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time that I wrote the first post, I was saying that I might end up going to the hospital. Well, the post was put on last Thursday, and I did end up going on Friday. I guess I hit a doctor that just didn't really want to listen, because he basically just focused upon my comment that my bf was doing well with his diabetes, and was helping me with mine. He completely ignored the fact that I had to take a very large amount of fast acting insulin in a rather short period of time (about 100 units within about six hours), and just started arguing over how I shouldn't be having my bf help. However, he did agree to doing bloodwork and an x-ray (I have a history of getting bone infections, four in 4.5 years), so there is that.

&amp;#x200B;

When he got back, he came with someone else, and explained that there weren't any signs of significant infection. Without anything to hold me in there, he went ahead and discharged me. He also said that my blood sugar was about 200 at the time, so wasn't a real worry. He did admit that the numbers weren't good, but that I appeared to be doing well enough for now. Of coarse, I was expecting them to at least hydrate me, to try to get my sugars down to a better level, but they apparently didn't feel that was necessary. At least I got a ride home with my home health nurse, who had been the one to drop me off.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the doctor(s) had opened up my bandage, but not made any attempt to rebandage me, I was able to get my home health nurse to rebandage me for the weekend. He was happy that I was going to see a different doctor, and decided to bring in a collegue of his that could see me under my insurance. This guy is a wound care doctor, that sees people in their homes, or nursing facilities. He doesn't have an office, but they could both see me today earlier. I was fine with that, because I rarely have any non-medical obligations, and wasn't expecting to see anyone except them this week.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I did have a wound care appointment for tomorrow, I cancelled it, and requested some script refills that had been requested last week, but weren't called in. I have to remember to call them tomorrow as well, because there is another med that my pharmacy has no refills for, so I need that altered and refilled. I will be honest, I didn't tell them that I was transferring doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

I did call my insurance, so that I could change my doctor. Turns out that I could file a comment about both the doctor, for her lack of listening to me, as well as her staff, due to their problems with referrals and scripts. The insurance is also aware that I'll be redoing all of my referrals through this new doctor, so I won't be seeing my pain management (they gave me a very weak muscle relaxer, which did nothing for my pain issues. Ended up giving the pills to my bf, hoping they would help him, because of his lower pain tolerance), or my eye doctor. I wanted the chance to work on my diabetes control before seeing the eye doctor, in hopes that controlling my diabetes will resolve most, if not all, of my current eye issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before the wound care doctor, and my home health nurse, arrived, I found out that apparently I stubbed my foot, right above where my original wound is. Now that can be a cause for concern, because it might take a long time to heal as well. Also, the location is difficult, because I commonly rest my foot on my toes, without thinking. So I have to be very careful, and make sure I'm not applying pressure on both wounds, to allow them the best chance of healing. The new wound doctor does seem to know what he's doing, and he even had a contact numbing spray that he used, not that he needed it. I told him that my neuropathy prevents me from feeling a lot (If anything, I can sometimes feel pressure. It takes a LOT for me to feel pain). But I'm just happy that he feels like he can help me, and will continue seeing me on a once a week schedule, at home.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to recap (a TLDR, if you want), I have a new doctor I'll be seeing in just over a week. I will also be seeing a wound care doctor once a week at home, as well as three/four times a week visit with my home health nurse. I did comment about my lack of treatment to my insurance, so they will do some investigating for me, about both the doctor, and her staff. I have a new wound, a blood blister, but the new wound care doctor seems optimistic about it, and will keep an eye on it during his visits. The ER doctor basically dismissed my concerns once he heard my bf mentioned, but did order x-rays and blood work. Since there was no immediate danger, he discharged me. My blood sugar readings are now between 200-300, so the once a week shot I had last week does appear to be helping me.",1,Update to: I'm changing my primary doctor (Epic),18

This happened a few months ago I think, so perhaps not all of the details are accurate, plus I wasn't there to begin with. I'm just gonna go off of what my dad told me.

My dad and step-mom were at a semi-small retail store buying grapes. Now, I'm not sure about in other stores, towns, or countries, but in that store it wasn't uncommon for customers to pick out and toss any crappy grapes or small fruit. That might sound bad, but not only is doing such things supposed to be the employees' jobs, but you're kinda expected to wash fruit before you eat it anyways. You're still expected to pay for the whole price of the bag anyway, so it's not like the store is losing any money. So, my step-mom's picking out some grapes because there didn't seem to be any good bags of grapes at that time, and this employee, I think late-thirties to forties comes up and just starts chewing her out. Something about health concerns and about some guy who smokes and digs through the trash doing the same thing. My dad and I really have no idea what his deal was. As I said, other customers do the same thing all the time, and I seem to recall my dad mentioning that they had even seen another customer doing it *as they were walking in.* The employee never did get physical, but he was pretty relentless. My step-mom's a pretty tough woman, at least in the sense that she's not afraid to scream if she has to, to the point where she borderlines being an entitled parent, but she, according to my dad, was damn near tears. My dad likes to avoid confrontation where he can, so he probably backed off a little, still paying attention in case it got physical of course. At this point, other customers from nearby aisles were looking on, but I couldn't tell you if they were entertained, uncomfortable, annoyed, or some combination of the three.

The employee eventually gave up and left my parents alone. That didn't stop my dad from trying to find the manager, who was on a first-name basis with my parents, even though they weren't what my dad would call friends. The manager was taking a day off, but his wife, who happened to be an employee, was there. A quick discussion with her revealed that the employee my step-mom had encountered had a history of doing things like this. My dad didn't feel like pressing the issue because technically no harm was done. They continued their shopping as usual, though probably a bit quicker before. Funnily enough, by the time they left, the manager had actually returned from his day off. He exchanged some words with my parents. I don't remember if he offered them anything, but if he did, my parents more than likely turned it down. What he did do though was bring out the employee to apologize to my step-mom. According to my dad, he did seem pretty apologetic and didn't do anything that came off as sarcastic.

Afterwards, not much else happened. My parents just came home as usual and sometime after supper, my dad told me the whole thing. I don't know what happened to the employee, whether he got fired or just disciplined. For all I know, maybe nothing happened to him beyond being moved to a different position within the store. Perhaps this isn't the most entertaining story, but my dad and I had a laugh about it. What amazed us is the fact that the manager actually came to the store on his day off. It didn't seem nearly serious enough for that to me, but maybe he came there to do something else too.

The grapes were garbage by the way. I think we ended up throwing them out a few days later.",1,My step-mom gets shouted at while buying grapes,164

I first had to figure out what IntelligentPost delivery was.  With IntellignetPost delivery, GovFast doesn't deliver the package directly to us; they deliver the package to our local post office who, in turn, delivers it to us.  GovFast website does show that the item has been delivered, but I can't see who signed for the package.  I was also wondering if the the delivered status indicated that it was ONLY delivered to the local post office who would deliever the package to us at a later date.

I thought the bag of food would follow, but instead she just meekly says, ""Goodbye,"" which shocks me. I questioned her, and it turns out, she only received the drinks. She claimed that she even asked about food, and was basically told to leave by the cashier. I'm clearly not happy, but I also made it clear that I didn't blame the driver, and she offered to go back and see what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

She gets back to the restaurant, which I see since I'm able to track her through the app, and I receive a call from the cashier at the fast food place. I tried to explain the situation, but every time I try, this cashier would cut me off and say, ""The receipt only had two cokes."" This woman was clearly lying since the $30.19 had been removed from my account. I keep trying to tell her this, but all I hear is: ""The receipt only had two cokes."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I snapped. I usually NEVER get dry and snarky with retail workers, but this time, I was hungry, stressed, and pissed, and I said this: 

ME - Me. 

C - Cashier

&amp;#x200B;

ME: Look at the receipt. What did the total come to? 

C: Let me check...It says only two cokes, and it came to $30.19. 

ME: Does that sound reasonable to you? Last I checked, two cokes are not FIFTEEN DOLLARS EACH! 

C: Let me talk to my manager and I'll call you back. 

&amp;#x200B;

She never called me back. Instead, the driver returned with the food that I was promised (Even though ""The receipt only had two cokes."" Hmmmmmm.) I thanked her, told her she went above and beyond, rated her highly, and gave her the biggest tip I could. 

&amp;#x200B;

TBH, I still don't really know what happened.

So this was a few months ago around December of last year. Me, my mom, my sister, and her then boyfriend at the time decided to go to San Francisco for a sort of mini-vacation, and during our time there we went to this DVD/Music shop that’s very popular in the San Francisco area, anyway, I wanted to look for some anime DVDs to see if anything was good. Little did I know I had accidentally stumbled into... the non kid friendly type of anime. (me being a short teenager, this would be a big no no) Soon after I stumbled upon this unholy anime, an employee rushed over to me and asked me if was sure I was in the right section. So I assured him I knew where I was and what I wanted, so he promptly walked away while saying something among the lines of “Whatever you say kid.” And then faded from my view. This is when I realized my mistake and I quickly left that part of the store.

Looking at several walkers out of my price range, i finally find a tag for one that's a good price... But there's none on the shelf. I found it hiding behind the crib displays, open, and clearly messed with. I asked a nearby employee if there were others, but they confirmed it was the last one. Nothing seemed missing, though, and the seal wasn't broken on the toys that attach to it, so i was cool with it. After i selected some toys, i saw a sign that advertised 50% off those toys.

At self check out, i called over an employee to check over the opened walker just to be sure it was in good shape, and she said it was. 

Me: ""obligatory request for a discount since it's the last one and someone opened it?""

Employee: ""yeah I'll give you 10%""

Me: ""cool! Definitely appreciate it! Hey, another question. The sign in toys said 50% off but i can't tell if this thing actually applied the discount. Can you show me how it determines the discount?""

Employee: ""yeah, it takes 25% off of a couple things and it equals out. You know what, let me just do this... (adjusts the discount on the walker to 30% off)""

I work retail, so i totally would have been fine with no discount since the walker was in tact, and definitely did not expecting a further discount for the toys. If i were in her shoes, i would have shown how the discount applied and called it a day.

95,sincerelymissp,0,t3_bfdy9z,43,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bfdy9z/the_most_secondhand_embarrassment_ive_ever/,"This happened several years ago when my immediate family went on vacation with my grandparents to a popular vacation destination in mountains of the southern U.S. This was a yearly 4th of July tradition for us. I was around 13-14 at the time.

We had been outside most of the day and decided to pop into one of our favorite themed diners for a late lunch. Since it wasn't a popular meal time, we were some of the only customers in the restaurant. My grandparents and parents had been going on this vacation together for years before my brother and I were born, so they knew most of the local restaurant owners pretty well. After chatting and catching up with this diner's owners, we were seated and our waitress came by to get drink orders. She had just started working there and repeatedly told us how much she loved it  but asked for us to forgive her if she made any mistakes since she was new and still getting the hang of things. My family is pretty chill and we definitely weren't in any rush, so we assured her it was perfectly fine. We all ordered waters since we had been out in the hot sun all day, and we got several refills throughout the meal.

Fast forward, our food comes and it is fantastic, the waitress is incredibly sweet and cheery and is doing a great job despite her warnings earlier. We chatted with her throughout the meal and my grandparents even remarked that they were impressed with her after she would leave our table. Since we were her only table, she was extra attentive and took wonderful care of us. Now, I should mention that this young woman was fairly large, both tall and slightly overweight. Near the end of the meal she came back to refill our waters again. My grandfather's water was slightly over halfway full, but the other 5 of us were nearly empty. The waitress filled up all of ours, then turned to my grandfather and asked if he would like her to top his off as well. What I assume my grandfather *meant* to say was, ""Sure, I'm sure you could use the practice"" as a reference to her being new and asking us to have patience with her. (Looking back, it still isn't exactly a polite thing to say, but trust me that my grandfather is the sweetest human in the entire planet and would never say something rude. He said it in the playful tone that we had been carrying on the entire meal, and if those had been his words, I'm sure there never would have been a problem.) What he said instead, to the sweet new overweight waitress, was, ""Sure, I'm sure you could use the **exercise.**""

I wanted to crawl under the table. Our entire family just stopped talking and stared at him. The waitress went from laughing and being cheerful to a look of shock followed by a huge blush of embarrassment. The worst part was that my grandfather had no clue what he said and was still holding out his glass and smiling at her. She refilled it without a word and ran off. The rest of us turned to him and asked why he had said that. He was oblivious but felt incredibly embarrassed when we told him. The waitress returned to our table only to drop off and pick up the check, understandably saying little during that exchange despite my grandfather being extremely polite. Knowing him, that waitress probably got a HUGE apology tip. He did make a point to visit with the restaurant owners on the way out and told them that their new waitress was doing a fantastic job. It's still a regular topic that we like to tease him about, and every time he blushes and just shakes his head at himself.",1,The most secondhand embarrassment I've ever experienced,955

Some lady comes up to the bar to place a sushi to-go order for her and some friends, and she’s clearly never eaten sushi before.  She asks a million questions about every roll (which is fully described on the menu). Her questions start not that bad, like “well how *much* cream cheese is in the roll?” and “what is panko?” This is mildly annoying, but completely fair. Then things go downhill.

She takes a break to call her friends and asks similar questions to them. “well which one will I like more?” (Like her friends will know her tastes). It’s about a 15 minute phone call about what sounds good, and what sounds “disgusting” loud enough for everyone to hear. Eventually it sounds like she has an order in mind.

Then she says “I’m allergic to shellfish, so I can’t have anything with shellfish touch my stuff” (again fair, but sort of annoying at a sushi place). And she starts to place the order. After placing an order of about 10 different rolls, she ends with the banger...

C for customer, S for server

C “oh wait, does that last roll have any rice in it?”

S “... yes”

C “oh boy, a lot of us don’t eat rice”

S -*blank, defeated stare*

C “can you make that roll without rice?”

S “I guess we could, but it won’t hold together well. And just so you’re aware, every roll has rice.”

C “*REALLY*? Every sushi has rice?!”

S “yes, that is what the rolls are rolled around with. We can try and make them with no rice, but it will just be seaweed wrapped about the filling, which may not hold together well”

C  “there is *seaweed* on the rolls?!”

The menu only specifies what the fillings are, it doesn’t explicitly say that rice and seaweed are included.

(Back Info)
I joined the Gym June 2018 (year contract) and signed up for personal training at the same time. Things were going great (-50lbs) so when the Manager told me in that they were going to do a 12 week bootcamp l signed up and had great success.

In November I found out I'd be moving to another state June 2019. Bootcamp had just ended and the Manager tells me they are going to keep the bootcamp but now on month to month bases. So I signed up for classes. THEN  the Manager straight up disappears a month ago.

(Today)
Now that it's getting closer to moving day I'm finding out what I need to cancel things. The new manager looked stressed and basically refers me to just call corporate because he is scared to give me the wrong info. When I'm talking to the lady she keeps referring to THREE contracts. I told her I just have two... one for personal training I just want to make sure it doesn't auto renew. The other is for bootcamp which is month to month. She then tells me the bootcamp isn't month to month so I'll have to pay half of what's left and a cancellation fee. BUT here is the kicker I have ANOTHER year contract for extra training sessions for $38 a month that I supposedly signed in December. 

Why in the world would sign a YEAR contract if I and everyone at the gym knew I was moving in a few months. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about with the third contact! She said I signed in on December 31st so I asked if she could send me all 3 contracts. My fiance was driving while I was on the phone so he starts driving straight to the gym while hearing this. Once we get there the new manager, my trainer &amp; my fiance are all trying to figure what this 3rd contract was. I'm reading the emails on my cell trying to understand when I get to the 3rd one my heart sunk and started shaking! It looked nothing like my signature! I hadn't signed it. I showed the manager and he starts freaking out too..... turns out I'm not the only client having this issue. Apparently ExManager didn't disappear for no reason. He left the country because of all the shady things he did to clients. 

I called corporate back with manager and he explains the situation. They canceled it and said they are going to reimburse me for the payments it had already automatically withdrew. Unfortunately I still have to pay the other one I thought was month to month. I didn't even push it because I signed that one and should've read it carefully and not just taken his word.

Tonight I was out celebrating my boyfriend's acceptance into a local University and we were very excited and looking forward to an excellent dinner at Spicy Chain Restaurant. We arrived after our workout at a local gym at around 10pm. I looked over and noticed a small family who seemed to be from France, the mother hastily bringing in her 3 daughters and the husband trailing behind.

We all waited for a seat, half of the restaurant was unoccupied, but the other half seemed full for a Friday night. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated in a small booth to the side of one of the main walkways. The other family was seated shortly after. We waited an additional 10 minutes before one lady came by and took our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer this time as well. Meanwhile, across the table, a very large group of college-age students were finishing up their meal. 

We waited around 10 minutes for our chips, drinks, napkins, straws, etc. to arrive and we began eating. We noticed the waitress seemed to be hiding in the back after this point, and other waiters were haphazardly cleaning, taking orders, and mingling amongst themselves. At this point I was becoming very frustrated because of the lack of attention to us, we ate our appetizer and needed refills, but I had to flag down a male waiter instead after around 15 minutes. He returned with our refills shortly after. 

I wanted to order the entrees after receiving the refills, but the waiter seemed busy and walked away quickly. We waited another 25 minutes before I grew frustrated and flagged another male waiter to take our order. He took the order and put it in. At this point I never saw the original waitress until she came with our food, only after about 45 minutes, over an hour after being seated AND after the family we came in with was slowly making their way out; kids with half-eaten french fries in their hands. 

I told a few snark remarks to the waitress and she didn't seem interested but apologized. She made a joke about how we got to spend extra time with them tonight. 

So, we ate, and never saw that waitress again. But, we did see another female waitress after we finished our meals and flagged her down for dessert. She had just finished being yelled at by another customer over something incorrect on his plate. She seemed frustrated and defeated (per the look on her face). Poor girl, but she didn't seem interested in providing good service as well. 

She returned with our desserts about 5 minutes later, we ate, but didn't see her come over to our side again so we flagged another male waiter to get our check.

100,bluja000,0,t3_bewdy6,175,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bewdy6/ill_be_changing_my_primary_care_doctor/,"I've been seeing a primary care doctor for about... I'm thinking around eight months now? Maybe longer. Her husband also does wound care, which I need. I'm a type two diabetic, but my bf thinks that I'm reacting as if I'm a type one instead (not making any insulin whatsoever, maybe needing an insulin pump). My doctor knows that I'm a diabetic, and changed my medication pretty much right after I started seeing her. And I also saw her husband, and his staff, because I started seeing them while I had wounds from breaking my ankle (contact sores that turned into diabetic ulcers, ending in me getting bone infections, twice in less than six months). With a recent insurance change, I no longer see the wound care doctor AS wound care, he's now billed as primary care, because otherwise I'd have to see someone else, since insurance doesn't cover him as wound care.

&amp;#x200B;

So, recently, my bf had to be hospitalized for diabetic complications, and then was assigned a new primary care doctor. His former health care was being handled by the VA, but they really were not properly treating him. Since I got him on Medicaid (no income currently for him), he was able to choose someone other than the VA. This doctor really impressed both of us. She even had VA training, and was willing to both listen, and talk to him (and me) about his diabetic issues. Since she really impressed me, I started talking about moving to her. She's closer to me (right down the street, versus 2-3 hours by bus), and her clinic accepts my current insurance. My only beef is that her staff is EXTREMELY inexperienced (they have messed up the pharmacy call-ins for all of his appointments), but at least they do listen and follow instructions when I call them and tell them what needs doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, bf agrees that changing doctors is a good idea. However, before I had made that decision, I had called to make an appointment with primary, to discuss the status of my foot, and my diabetes. Bf feels that my sugars are uncontrolled (200-400+ on all but three recent tests), and feels that my medication needs to be drastically changed. I agree, having received a far better education from him than from any doctor that I had spoken to. His information was based upon the highly involved training he had received from the VA when he was first diagnosed, mid 2000's, I think. So I followed his instructions, and got three readings under 200, but never anywhere near crashing (under 70). Now, this was with me taking insulin when I got up, not eating anything until lunch, and taking insulin before those meals. And it wasn't uncommon for him to tell me to take more, depending upon what my readings were.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'd already been depressed and tired of everything. Just basically feeling like I couldn't ever see normal readings, and that it was going to kill me sooner or later. And because of previous depression episodes, I knew that I really wasn't going to care if that happened. I'd be sad for my bf, and my cats, but I really didn't care. He was NOT happy when I told him that once, after telling him and my home health nurse about my recent reading (400+, fasting), but that day, I saw my first ""low"" reading, based off what he told me to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Because he basically told me to change some medication, and it seemed to work, I was willing to go to my doctor, and ask them to change my meds back to older, more reliable meds (long acting insulin was supposed to be given to already controlled diabetics, not wildly uncontrolled, like me), and to change others out due to potential resistance. So I went, today, to see her. The wound care doctor wasn't in, but I'm supposed to see him on Tuesday. I'm really thinking of just cancelling, and seeing what my bf's doctor can do.

&amp;#x200B;

When I spoke to my doctor, I explained that my readings were very uncontrolled, and that I wanted to be off the current long term. I understood that any alternatives would still likely have a co-pay, but so did this one. My co-pays, fortunately, are controlled by having SSDI disability that is under the poverty level. I still need to have the insurance cover most of the cost, while Medicaid covers either the entire remainder, or leaves me paying just a few dollars, at most. It's still a hardship, especially when they make changes that require co-pays in the middle of the month, but I manage.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, no matter what I said, my doctor kept insisting that I stay on the original meds, and add new ones to the mix. Now, she was telling me about that new Libra system, the one that has the needle attached to your arm, and you swipe at any time for a reading? As well as adding the once a week non-insulin injectable that we'ves started hearing about. She told me that there are coupon cards that give you the new meds free for at least a month, and sent me on my way. I did have to give my local pharmacy details to their staff, since my regular one is online only, and couldn't handle coupon cards/codes.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I wasn't happy, because she really didn't listen to me. Got to the local pharmacy, the staff never called in the order. Now, the online order seems to have arrived, but not the new coupon code meds. Talking to the pharmacy staff, turns out that the cards tell you that they can't be used if you are part of a federal/state help program. Like extra help, which I'm on (that's what controls the cost of my COVERED meds), Medicaid, I think even Medicare. But anyway, the staff was looking right at the card, and knew that I was still being billed through both Medicare, and Medicaid, which doesn't qualify.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought, ok, I can handle seeing if I can get my brother to help me with the co-pays, because these were NOT generic. Then I find out, my insurance doesn't cover these new meds. I can't get Libra (that would be so awesome, if I could use it, even briefly), or the once a week injectible. All of this really pissed me off. The staff and doctor should have been at least minimally aware. And I think that the staff knew that the Libra system was NOT covered, before they ever set me up with the coupon card. I guess they thought I would be under complete control within a month. After being uncontrolled for years, not months/days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fortunate. I can transfer to this other doctor. And if I call Medicare, I can see if there's a Medicare Supplemental plan that will cover the meds I need. I just have to make the change by end of June '19, and it goes into effect in July. But what gets me is that this doctor is one that my home health nurse thought was really good. And it's frustrating that she just ignores me. I think that I might even end up hospitalized, maybe even as early as tomorrow, due to my foot wound, and my high sugar readings.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, here's a TLDR for everyone:

As a wildly uncontrolled diabetic, I went to my doctor to get meds changed to older, more reliable meds. Doctor ignored my complaints, just suggested adding newer meds and the new Libra system (little device on the arm that you scan, rather than pricking yourself). Found out that new meds aren't covered by insurance, and can't use coupon codes, due to receiving federal/state aid. Staff didn't even bother calling the order into the pharmacy, despite being given the address, and acknowledging it. My bf has a different doctor, who really impressed me. Her staff is inexperienced, but they listen when they mess up, whereas my current doctor's staff are seasoned, and still mess up on referrals and scripts. Since his doctor takes my insurance, I'm transferring to her, even if I end up hospitalized (maybe as soon as tomorrow).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Update- sorry if my update format is bad. I'm on my phone, in the er. My home health nurse and bf hashed it out, and ultimately decided hospital was best.

So here I am, sitting with an IV in my arm I spoke to someone about my issue, but he started focusing on the fact that my bf being diabetic doesn't mean his advise would help me.  Then he basically seemed to stop listening at that point.

However, he did seem to think I need antibiotics, and ordered x-rays and blood work (hence the IV). Because of numerous incidents of bone poisoning,

Well, doctor just came in. They don't feel anything needs immediate care, and are discharging me. They say there's no signs of (significant) infection, and don't want to give me anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, Update #2: So, my home health nurse came and picked me up, once I was fully discharged. I was given partial discharge papers detailing some of the results of the blood test. Unfortunately, not everything was completed, so it wasn't fully documented. But my nurse looked everything over, and verified that at least I wasn't in serious (right now) type danger.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, he's going to have a wound care DOCTOR that he works with, come by and visit on Monday. This guy has worked together for a while, so they both trust each other and their respective opinions. And this doctor will come to my house, and takes my insurance, apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

This means I can focus on changing doctors, and getting as early an appointment with this new doctor as I can. My bf was very eager to come with me, because he wants to make sure that the doctor fully understands what we have been seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

My meter, once my bf got a hold of it and checked around, told us that my average since Feb. 14 has been between 260-280. So, although definitely not great, is still better than we thought it was. I have a lot of issues with reading my meter, because the screen isn't really designed with my sight issues in mind. But the phone app does help as well, with reading the averages and such.

&amp;#x200B;

When I left the hospital, they had told me there was no signs of ""significant"" infection, and that my blood work showed a blood sugar of about 200. Now, this was still fasting, and was taken around 2pm, so I hadn't eaten since around 8pm yesterday? at that point. I also tried to explain that I was given a starter dose of the once a week injectable, which is supposed to have a serious impact upon my blood sugars. I wouldn't be surprised if that, in combination with both the low amount of food I ate yesterday, and length of time since I had eaten, all contributed to the ""low"" reading.

&amp;#x200B;

But, hey, if I end up in the hospital again, they may find reasons to keep me, such as another bone infection, or a severe ulcer, who knows.

I’m scouting the sale rack and they have loads of awesome maternity dungarees and I hunt down my size. The tags have all been scribbled on and you can read “£12” written on the scribble. Try them on and they’re great. 

Get to the checkout and she says that’ll be £26. I hand over the money and my MIL jumps in to say there’s been a mistake and shows the cashier the tag. She just shrugs and says someone must have mismarked them, other dungarees are on sale but not these. MIL explains that all the other dungarees on sale are the exact same and besides all the tags are marked £12. The cashier flips over the tag and explains the scribble is meant to show scrubbing out the “on-sale” price to show it’s actually at its normal full price!! 

My MIL gets really angry at this point and says they can’t just mark tonnes of clothes, put them on the sale rack and then charge people full price at the counter. The cashier snaps that all the other dungarees must be different so goes up to check, my MIL follows her and stops them as they’re removing all the dungarees from the sale rack! She says what they’re doing is illegal and wants to speak to a manager, apparently the manager isn’t available. 

We end up giving up and paying for another item I wanted and leaving with some pretty hefty attitude from the cashier and another shop floor lady. 

Ultimately is that legal, can they just mark down the clothes then attempt to charge me normally at the til and claim it’s just a mistake?",1,On-Sale clothes with marked down tag still full price! Illegal?,227

My qplp (queer platonic life partner) and I go to this one particular cafe on the first of the month. It started as a curiosity, since it's close to where we go to pay bills, and we're new to the area so why not baby step into something new.

As it turned out, the coffee was to die for, the smoothie was glorious, they served our very different but absolute favorite foods, allergy safe fresh made to order, and the service was polite and helpful, and absolutely accommodating

We were so wowed we left a 20$ tip (a few dollars more than what we paid for our breakfast that day) and we've gone back frequently, leaving 20$ tips every time, since we noticed that the in spite of their delicious food and drink and amazing service, they don't get tipped very often.

Well, April 1st came around and we went to pay our bills as usual. My partner noticed they didn't have enough cash on them for a tip and asks them to hold on so he could go grab money from the ATM

The worker we know the best comes over and gives him a Stern-mom look.

""No more tipping. You've tipped more than enough. no more tipping! You don't have to anymore. I'll be watching""

So I reviewed the cafe on Google and Yelp, with glowing remarks and five stars. I don't know what to do to thank them for being awesome, but hopefully someone sees the reviews and they get more traffic. They deserve it.

This dress is for my wedding... in two days. The time is 5. They close at 5:30. My dress is not a traditional wedding gown it’s a satin dress you could wear to a fancy dinner.

The dress was suppose to be done two days ago. I dropped it off four weeks ago and the owner took measurements. I came back on the day I was suppose to pick it up only to find out they have not done anything to the dress. Of course I’m freaking out because the wedding is on Friday.

I keep coming back each day to try on the dress and for them to make fixes. Today (Wednesday) at 1:30 they tell me it will be done in an hour and to come back. I come back and they say it is not done and it will take 20 minutes. It’s 2:30, and I figured 20 mins is not too long. I wait.

Then this woman comes in to pick up her dress. The owner says sorry it’s not ready please come back tomorrow. Red flag. We ignored the first red flag when she delayed my fiancé’s alterations we ignored it thinking she had a bad day and seemed sweet.

After she leaves, the dress is ready. Or so I thought. The left side is uneven and makes my right breast look significantly larger. So she has to go back and fix it. When she goes in the back room, she is frustrated and talks in Spanish to her workers obviously talking about me and my dress.

They keep making up excuses to why it’s not ready. Too much fabric. Material is too hard to fix. Or it’s my fault. Honestly, it’s not ready because they talk the whole time. When the we’re doing measurements and I told them which parts needed to be done, they didn’t even look or would cut me off or talk to someone else. 

I’m still waiting. I hope the dress gets fixed. I feel like crying. I’ve been nothing but nice to them and I am growing frustrated.

Update: Thank you everyone for the support and kind words. I ended up waiting another hour and finally she was able to finish it. Someone said to wait out front while they worked on it. I ended up doing exactly that. I didn’t want to become bridezilla so I continued to be patient and just wait it out. The mistake I made before was leaving after I would try it on and trusting their word that it will be done. The place had great reviews on google which was odd but I happened to miss one bad review that described a similar situation. They may have great reviews on Google but their customer service and not so great professionalism will speak for itself. As I was waiting, I witnessed even more frustrated customers trying to pick up their clothes
I wanted to leave and just find another tailor but it was already late and I was busy all day tomorrow with appointments and classes for school. 

The reason I didn’t bring it in earlier was because my in-laws wanted the wedding to be on Friday. Originally, this was planned for the summer time. I am just happy I will be able to wear the dress for the wedding. Also, (Thursday) is my last day of classes!

Felt adventerous, so I decided to go out shopping at the malll. I passed by one of the stores at the mall, found a shirt that caught my eye, and asked one of the salesman the price.

Now let me tell you, this salesman is a POS. He holds the shirt I wanted to buy and **begins to rub his knuckle against my chest**. I paused, and thought, no way. Maybe I am standing too close. So I take a step back and continue to inquire about the shirt. Again, with his hand concealed, he comes closer and rubs against me while pretending to discuss the shirt.

I get pissed off, physically take hold of his hand, push him off, and tell him to fuck off before storming off. 

I felt self-concious the whole day even though I am pretty covered up but honestly, fuck people like him. I wonder if I should've punched his face too

&amp;#x200B;

I was studying in Spain, and whilst out there, took a weekend trip to see a friend who was living in a city nearby. Despite being relatively close to where I was living, the trip there was hellish, so my friend suggested we take it easy that night and just order in some food and catch up in the apartment. We call up the local Chinese restaurant and place our pretty modest order, and were told to expect delivery in the next 40 minutes. Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Well the 40 minute window comes and goes, with no delivery. No biggie, its a Friday night - maybe they were just busy. After an hour, we call up the restaurant to ask when we might expect to get our delivery. They explain that the food is out for delivery, and that they will call the delivery driver and then get back to us. Another half an hour goes by and there's still no sign of the food nor the call back from the restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

We call back, now pretty hungry, and ask what the deal was. They ask us to hold, and then they hang up. We call again, and this time no answer. Its now an hour and 40 minutes after we placed the order. We try calling one more time, and they pick up. I explain that if the food isn't coming, just let us know so we can just cook something for ourselves. I ask them if they're sure the food is coming, and finally the lady snaps at me in English ""food isn't coming"" and hangs up.

&amp;#x200B;

That was that I guess, but the whole situation had made me pretty hangry. We whip up some pasta and just have that while we catch up and watch some TV. But that wasn't the end of the saga.

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing, the doorbell rings. Two and a half hours after we ordered our food. We opened the door, and there stood the most stoned looking individual I had - or have since - laid eyes on. The man was standing there, baked as cake, eyes as red as the devils dick, just a little bit too high to be afraid. He tries to tentatively hand us the food, and murmurs a meek little ""that'll be 20 euros please..."". I was so exasperated and amused that I actually laughed. I asked him where he was? Why the food was so late? I said we would take the food at a hefty discount. He said ok, scrambled through a bag of, presumably, other people's orders, handed us some containers, fumbled around in his wallet, and finally, tried to hand me three euros. I asked what the three euros were for, and with a puzzled expression he says ""that's your change"".

My friend and I just lost it at this point. I felt so bad for this dude, and a little bit empathetic, so through fits of laughter we handed him 15 euros and sent him on his way. I'll never forget his little ""I'm laughing too but I don't know why"" giggles as he walked off down the corridor.",1,Stoned delivery driver goes awol,64

I am a university student so I often go to the Double Arch Restaurant (figure it out) and buy lunches there. Occasionally, my BF(Boyfriend) would want a breakfast burger whenever we commute to the city for classes. Naturally, we both gravitated to the self-order machines cause it was easier to use. He wanted a chicken brekkie burger again from yesterday that was pretty new for Double Arch Restaurant to have and he liked it more than his usual. So we ordered it as normal and make sure that ALL SAUCES WERE REMOVED. BF doesn't like sauces so we specifically made sure to get rid of all the sauces they show us on screen for that chicken brekkie burger. So we paid and got the meal after waiting and head to the upstairs section to eat. 

Keep in mind, we had gotten this burger before so it was natural that we were surprised at the Mayo. And boy, was there a lot of Mayo. The entire bottom bun was almost like a paint palette with mayo spread so much across it. We couldn't save the bacon and the eggs. Pretty frustrated at the moment since we gotta get to class in half an hour, I went back downstairs with the receipt and the burger so I could get a new one for BF.

My exchange with the employee (E) there went like this:

Me: Um excuse me?

E: Yeah?

Me: \*puts the burger and the receipt on the counter\* I ordered this burger and I'm sure there isn't supposed to be mayo in it so could I get a new one without mayo and bbq?

E: No, this burger has mayo, you should've taken this off

Reminder: We took off all the sauces we saw from the menu. No mayo in the list of ingredients.

Me: It wasn't on the machine at all, no option to take out the mayo. I don't want it.

E took the burger and apologised (thankfully) but when I got the new burger, I inspected it and didn't see an overflow of mayo. At first. I took it back upstairs and gave it back to BF with confidence.

BF opens the burger. The mayo was back and was hidden well from my eyes. We were both getting agitated so we decided to just toss it and never order it again. Also, for the record, the last time we ordered the chicken brekkie burger at the SAME Double Arch Restaurant, it came with NO SAUCES or NO CHICKEN. 

Double Arch Restaurant, please give us options to get rid of everything next time? Or at least make sure that orders don't get screwed up twice in a row?

110,Charlieuk,0,t3_bdev6v,25,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bdev6v/this_is_not_your_hotel/,"I've just spent the weekend in London with my dad and sister, had some great customer service, and some terrible. This story took place just as we arrived into the city on Friday night. We were staying at a budget cheap hotel with lots of locations, they're all named for the location like Hotelname Kings Cross, Hotelname Euston etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We walked to our hotel from the train station (confirmed we were in the right place by the sign on the door and google maps confirming we were indeed at Hotelname Euston) and we had this conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: Hi we're here to check in. (shows paperwork)

&amp;#x200B;

HotelEustonworker: (in rather broken and heavily accented English) Wrong hotel. You need the other hotel up the street.

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: No, we need Hotelname Euston, that's here (again shows paperwork). We'd like to check in.

&amp;#x200B;

HotelEustonworker: No, this is Hotelname Euston 102, you need Hotelname Euston 101 up that road (vaguely points). 

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: The only hotel Hotelname we passed on this street was Hotelname St Pancras, that is not our hotel, this is. 

&amp;#x200B;

HotelEustonworker: No, wrong hotel. You go to other hotel. (more pointing)

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point I was pretty sure we were in the right place, I was adamant the worker was wrong since google maps confirmed we were in the right place but my dad was sick of dealing with this man and decided to walk to the other hotel as instructed. So we took our luggage and walked to other hotel. Predictably, the following conversation occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: Hi, we'd like to check in. I know the door says this is Hotelname St Pancras and we're supposed to be at Hotelname Euston but the bloke at Hotelname Euston said we have to come here instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

HotelStPancrasworker: Yeah this is Hotelname St Pancras mate, not Hotelname Euston, you need to go back to Hotelname Euston. (This guy seemed really apologetic and was trying to be helpful.)

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: We've just been there, he wouldn't check us in. 

&amp;#x200B;

HotelStPancrasworker: I'll check your booking to make sure but you're probably gonna have to go back up the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

(he checks our details and of course, we're at the wrong hotel)

&amp;#x200B;

HotelStPancrasworker: Sorry mate, you definitely need to go back to Hotelname Euston.

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: For fucks sake. The guy refused to check us in, he said something about him being at Hotelname Euston 102 and we need Hotelname Euston 101. I have no idea where we're supposed to go honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

HotelStPancrasworker: There's no such things as Hotelname Euston 102, it's just Hotelname Euston, it doesn't exist. Wait, was this guy Asian, quite short, young with short dark hair. (note, this guy was also Asian so he wasn't being racist, I think this must have happened before)

&amp;#x200B;

Mydad: Yeah, that sounds like him. 

&amp;#x200B;

HotelStPancrasworker: I know him, he's new. There's no such thing as 102, I don't know what he's on about but you need to go back. Sorry about that.

&amp;#x200B;

We thank him for his help and he apologises again, standard stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

So we traipsed back to the original hotel with all our stuff and (per my insistence) we walked past the HotelEustonworker and straight to the holes in the wall that look like cash points and checked ourselves in via the machine. When the machine gave us our room key cards the HotelEustonworker kept looking away and wouldn't look at us. He did this for our entire stay whenever we entered the lobby.

111,thelivingplanet,0,t3_bde40s,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bde40s/fighting_a_train_company_for_months/,"This happened a while ago, when I graduated from Uni.

My university program included a 5 months internship at the end of the last semester, right before graduation, and since I did my internship in a different country from where my university was based, and the company I interned at also hired me to continue to work there, I had to quickly travel to my Uni for graduation day and come back here the day right after to go back to work.

It was going to be a stressful journey but it was necessary for me in order to graduate, so I booked my flights and trains to be sure to get it done as quickly as possible. Graduation was going to be on a Friday, so I booked a flight on Thursday and the return on Saturday morning, so that I would at least be home on Sunday to rest a bit before going back to work on Monday. (Also note: my boyfriend who lived with me worked most weekends so it was rare for us to have a day off together. However he had that Sunday off so I was looking forward to be home with him)

The day of my flight comes and everything goes fine. I get to the remote town where my university was (basically had to fly to a neighbouring country and take 2 more trains to arrive), the next day I graduate and celebrate with my classmates, then the next morning (while horribly hangover I might add), I go catch the train back.

The first train arrives and leaves on time, everything good so far, then while I'm on the second train they start giving delay announcements. I'm not too worried at the beginning, I have only cabin luggage and I planned to get to the airport a couple of hours early anyway, but then the delay keeps increasing until we are just simply stranded in the middle of the countryside and we have no idea when we will be able to leave again.

The train announces that there will be buses and taxis called and paid by them to take passengers travelling to the airport to their destination so they don't miss their flight. They tell us to go ask if we need the service and I immediately make my way there, but obviously everyone else is doing the same and I have to swim through an enormous crowd to reach the coach where the staff was.

Once I'm close enough to hear what's being said, I understand that they have apparently already called every bus and taxi available nearby and we have now run out and no one will be taken to the airport anymore. According to them, the quickest way to get there is to stay put and wait until the train moves again. I ask the staff if I will be able to get a replacement plane ticket at least, since by now it's very unlikely I will make it to my flight, and they say that they don't know about the flight, but they will certainly pay for my accommodation if I happen to have to stay in the airport overnight. They tell me to just go to one of their offices at the end station and talk to someone there: they will fix a hotel for me.

I eventually arrive to my destination 4 hours late. I immediately run to see if I can book any ticket back home that night, but unfortunately there are no more flights for the day. I'm stuck there until the next morning and the Sunday I was hoping to spend with my boyfriend will now be spent travelling instead.

Anyway, not much can be done at this point. So I start wandering the airport's train station looking for an office belonging to the train company that got me into this situation so I can ask for a hotel. I can't find any, so I go ask at the help desk and the lady there almost laughs in my face. I am apparently an idiot for looking for that company's offices here! In fact, the train company is a company from country A (where my uni is) but I have now crossed the border to neighbouring country B (where I flied to and from) so obviously I won't find that company here! Silly me! And obviously the company's call centre has already closed for the day because that's how late it is, so there's no getting in contact with them anymore.

I kept trying to ask around, even called all the hotels in the vicinity of the airport to see if the train company has made any bookings for some stranded passengers but no one knows anything (I have no idea where all other passengers in my situation went to be honest).

Eventually I just book a room on my own and a taxi to get there (every hotel with shuttle service from the airport was fully booked because apparently, in my immense luck, I also got stuck in this city on the day of a massive festival, so it was a miracle I managed to find a room at all, which was obviously overpriced).

I kept receipts of everything, including the food I bought for dinner. The next day, once I finally reached home I sent an email to the train company asking for a refund for everything, attaching pictures of all the tickets and receipts.

I didn't have much hope since they are technically under no obligation to refund a flight for me if I miss it because of a train delay, however I quoted their policy directly from their website and since it was expected that they would offer alternative transportation in case of delay, and because they failed to do this I missed my flight, I tried to push for a plane refund too. Their policy also stated that they would cover accommodation and food expenses in cases like this, so I was hopeful to at least get that.

My email was ignored completely. I sent a second and a third one some time later but still received no answer. I then got in touch with a consumers association who sent them an email on my behalf and only then, 1 month later, I received an answer saying ""we are sorry about your experience, please send your bank details and we will refund you"".

So I did, i sent my details including very precise instructions on how not to fuck up the international transfer (nothing complicated, I just make sure to underline that it was important for them to include a reference number). I received no answer so I emailed back asking if they had sent the payment and if they could send a proof since I haven't received anything. Again no answer. I asked if I needed to provide a different back account and if they were having problems with the international payment. I received another email from them around 2 weeks later and the email was exactly the same as the first one they sent: ""we are sorry about your experience, please send your bank details and we will refund you"". Basically copy-pasted. I assumed they meant they needed a bank account from their own country. Luckily my boyfriend is from there so I just gave them my boyfriend's bank details in the hopes of making things easier. Once again: silence.

I called them a few times during this wait and on the phone I was dismissed with vague answers, but when pressured they said ""we will re-activate your errand"" (why was it deactivated in the first place since it was never resolved and no money was ever sent???) ""and put it as top priority"". I was told this exact same thing twice, on 2 different phone calls, but again never received any money.

I kept emailing back and forth with the customer association to try and get them to pressure the company, but even this process was long and draining since it was a matter that stretched over different countries and the customer association had its trouble operating internationally.

I felt like this train company was taking the piss by now and I just felt so powerless. My last option was to contact the national board for consumer disputes for their country, but before I ever sent them an email I got another email from the train company saying the payment had been made on my account for the full amount I had requested!

I thought this was finally over but of course they had to screw up once more and, even though this time I had a confirmation of transfer, I never received the money and the payment bounced back. They of course didn't include the reference I specifically told them to include.

So I asked them to please send the money to my boyfriend to simplify the process and to please send proof of payment. They immediately answered that the payment was done and to expect the money withing 2 business days, but they didn't attach any proof. 1 week later we still had received nothing so I emailed them and was ignored again. Then the following Monday I get another email saying ""it seems like the payment was sent 1 week late, it should have arrived now"", again, no proof.

In all this my boyfriend had also managed to lock himself out of his bank app by typing the wrong pin too many times and the only way for him to access it again was to go to one of their branches, which of course are in another country, in person! Fortunately he managed to convince the bank employee on the phone to confirm whether or not a certain sum of money was paid into his account or not and this time, finally, they confirmed that it was!

Eventually, several months later, my boyfriend went back home for a few days and took the opportunity to unlock his bank account so he could finally verify the sum he received (correct amount, including replacement flights, accommodation and food!) and send it me.

So in the end this whole ordeal took months to resolve. The train company's customer service was horrible and they could have definitely handled the situation a lot better, but I'm happy that I eventually pestered them enough to convince them to fully refund me, even if it just to shut me up.",1,Fighting a train company for months,105

We got seated pretty fast because my friend thought to call ahead since it was a Saturday night which was lucky in our case because the wait was already 45+ minutes when we arrived.

We get seated and our waitress comes over and tells us that she'll do her best but that they're six servers short and it's a madhouse because of this ball and prom. 

I felt bad because half our group was an hour late but we ordered drinks and I think that helped her get caught up with the tables around us. The table behind us was a mess, a couple with two small kids who were throwing food everywhere! When they left I overheard her and a few other servers getting frustrated with the mess they left.

All night our waitress was running around like crazy and I could tell she was flustered but she kept her cool and was upbeat and just lovely. The other people in our group got a little frustrated when they had to wait for her to come give us our checks but honestly I felt like it was karma for showing up an hour late.

I had some extra cash from not having to pay for a ticket so I decided to tip her $20 on top of what I tipped in order to round my bill up to an even number (for whatever reason unless I strictly want to tip 20% I always round up to the next even dollar amount). She was one of the best servers I've had in a while and I hope the rest of her night went well!

I could honestly never do what she does and I applaud the entire staff that was working last night for making everything run as smoothly as it did! Honestly the only thing that was delayed was the alcoholic drinks we got but that's because the one bartender working got backed up which was completely understandable. So I'll end with saying to all the servers out there that genuinely try to make patrons dining experiences good no matter the behind the scenes circumstances, y'all are awesome and I hope your good guests make up for all the bad ones.",1,I hope the rest of her night went okay,642

After getting everything that we needed we went to the registers and hopped on a line to check out. The lines are normally long at this store especially on the weekends and we knew to be patient. It was taking a little bit longer than we thought but didn't think much of it. 

Finally it was our turn and we did have a few big bulky items. (Including some cans of dog and cat food). The cashier seemed to be a bit off and after every item scan she would let out this big sigh (people have there off days so fine whatever no big deal).

After scanning the dog food she goes to my husband and says okay you can take it now. I am not lifting it and then let out an even bigger sigh. She just stared at us until we picked it up and put it in our cart. She didn't even move it to where you bag the groceries. She just left it where she scanned it and waited to scan the other items until it was moved. 

Outside the store there were people outside asking for donations and girl scouts selling cookies. We had no cash and decided to get cash back. BAD IDEA. While waiting for her to give us our cash back(register open and all) she decided she was hot. She decided to take her uniform vest off to take off the sweatshirt she was wearing. When she was finally finished we were allowed our 20 dollars in cash back. What normally would take about 5 minutes took about 20 minutes.

My wife and I live in Tokyo and a close friend of ours is visiting for a few days. We start the night off with some Japanese food and sake and then decide to go to a nightclub as one of my other close friends is DJing and he had an early slot and needed our support. 

We watch his set and we’re all getting a bit old so we don’t drink as much or stay out as late anymore, and decide to call it a night. We do still have a habit however of finishing off the night with either ramen, late night burger, or a kebab. Turns out there was a kebab stand right near the club so that made our decision easy and we proceed to stand in line. 

My wife runs across the street to buy some water from the convenience store, and my friend L orders a kebab wrap (wrapped in a tortilla instead of a pita) with a mix of spicy and garlic sauce for ¥400 and this is where things take a turn. 

Older gentleman worker: “Here’s your kebab, ¥500.”  

My friend L: “But it says on the sign it’s ¥400.”

Worker: “ I put extra chicken in it so it’s going to be ¥500.” 

L: “I didn’t ask for extra chicken.”

Worker: “¥500.”

L: “Okay... how about you take out the extra ¥100 worth of chicken you put in, and I pay ¥400 like the sign says?”

Worker: “Not possible. There is already sauce on this.”

At this point I’m watching the conversation thinking what the hell it’s your damn fault for putting the extra chicken and now you’re trying to charge my friend for a mistake you made? Obviously ¥100 which is about ¢90 US is not a big deal,  but on principle what he is doing is wrong so I felt I needed to speak up. 

Me: “Excuse me but it doesn’t make any sense for my friend to pay for a mistake you made...?”

Worker: “I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to her. This is her kebab not yours. Don’t talk.” 

Flabbergasted and speechless, I don’t say anything. 

L: “Actually it turns out I am running out of Yen anyway and I only have ¥400 so let’s just make it ¥400 and call it a day?”

Worker: “No. ¥500 take it or leave it. If you don’t want it for ¥500 then you don’t have to take it.” 

Me: “So you’re just going to waste it?” 

Worker: “This is not your business, don’t speak!” 

The worker takes out two of those massive kebab knives and starts sharpening them against each other as a show of intimidation. My wife comes back with water, me and L decide this is too much hassle for a fucking kebab, and we leave to get some ramen instead (which admittedly tasted much better).

I  was exploring options one night for food delivery as it was late and  only a few places were open. I was craving Tacos and I knew a place that  was open really late. Just so happened a delivery service was available  that was partnered with them. Midway through my order I get told the  kitchen is closed, which it most definitely isn't, not for another six  hours at least. But I let it go and moved on.

Tonight however, knowing I had more than enough time, I was going to get my Tacos.

I put together my order, set up all the information and sent it through, making sure to leave a decent tip for the driver

I  got a notification with a time stamp that said my order was received.  Not long after I got another saying that the order had been placed.

So, I'm waiting and waiting and get a new notification

""Your order is delayed"" - I didn't think too much about it. It's Saturday night, they are probably busy.

And then I get the second delay.

I'm  an hour into my wait when I call the store itself. Not only had my food  been delayed twice, it wasn't even being made! Not a single  representative from Delivery had arrived to even PLACE THE ORDER.

I.  Am. Upset. I make a call to customer service. I've been waiting an hour  for an order that is not being made and was told it was delayed twice.  Turns out the driver just didn't bother and also didn't even bother to  cancel. Customer service says it will take 20 minutes to get a new  driver. I say - sure, F\*\*\* it, gimmie tacos.

""Hey  there, its Delivery. Just spoke with the restaurant and your order  should be there around 20 minutes from now. I've sent you a promo code.  I'm so sorry your food is running late!""

and 10 minutes later

""Hi Saro0fdemons, DeliveryGuys here,. Your order has been canceled. Please check your email for more information.""

What? Why?!

I  call customer service again while looking at the email that tells me  nothing. Second driver TOOK TOO LONG it seems. 10 minutes is too long  and by protocol the order was cancelled. The money that was being held  from my account was returned and I had no tacos. Survey comes around and of course, I rate it according to my experience, it then suggests me  waiting on hold to speak to a Supervisor. Sure, why not.

A  kind lady picks up and patiently listens to my angry tirade of my 2  hour story of sadness trying to get tacos delivered. She apologizes and  offers me 40 bucks credit or my order delivered. I wanted tacos, so i asked for tacos. She promises me the order will be delivered and I wait in skepticism.

I get a text saying my food is on the way and soon after a phone call from the driver. Lo and behold. After 3 hours. Tacos.

I  tell the current driver about the ordeal and we have a good laugh while  he tries to apologize for the previous 2 drivers, to which I tell him  is no fault of his. I thank him for his time and finally get to enjoy my  tacos.

I  will not be using this service again. 2 out of 3 drivers did not care  about their service. But hey, third time was the charm I guess. Enjoying  my tacos while writing this. Also, customer service people were very  polite and understanding. I blame only the drivers who could've passed  the pick-up off to someone else or made some sort of attempt at  contacting anyone. Customer service had to hunt them down to find out  what was going on. Hoping there are more drivers for them like the one I finally got but the odds don't seem too good.",1,My first and last experience with this Delivery service.,61

He showed me he liked me by constantly negging me. I always shot him down in a really funny way so that it lifted the mood in the kitchen but also made him clear he needed to fuck off. It got back to me that he was calling me a nasty lesbian when I wasnt there.

You know the rest.

When I was 5 my grandma, my mom, my dad and a few other family members went to Florida. Since I was 5 I’m just going to be going off what I’ve been told. 

We got onto the flight and realized everyone was separated except for me and my mom, we split up and found our seats. We sat down in our seats that were by the emergency exit and got ready for the flight (I’ve been traveling my entire life so even as a kid I was really well behaved on planes). That’s when FA came strutting up. 

FA:you can’t have children in the emergency exit.
Mom: well we can’t sit anywhere else
FA: that’s not our problem, a child can’t sit here
Mom; I’m not letting my kid sit on a 4 hour flight alone!

FA goes on repeating the same things until my mom literally breaks down into hysterics. Now she’s crying in the isle because she doesn’t know what to do while this bitch just keeps saying we can’t sit there which is stressing my mom out.

FA: if you don’t move you’ll have to get off the plane
Mom: I cant go anywhere else! What do you expect me to do?

Edit: Well people seem to be getting really pissed off by this. In no way was my mom acting entitled in this story, she has anxiety (I should have mentioned that) so it was a really stressful situation for her. she had no problem moving the problem was they weren’t giving her a place to go, the plane was full.

If the attendant had realized we had nowhere to go and had helped us find a spot, everything would’ve been fine. But she didn’t, we’re not entitled for wanting someone to do their job.

126,Stormjunior,0,t3_bco01l,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bco01l/we_got_walked_by_hotel_cab_driver_couldnt_find/,"TLDR at the end

Nearly ten years ago now, my family and I (from the UK, me and my husband plus two teenage kids) arrived to start a long awaited and hard saved for holiday in Boston, staying at a large hotel in the city centre. Tired but excited, it was late evening and dark (relevant), we started checking in to be told we were being walked to a sister hotel across town. A little peeved as we didn't fancy another journey, but these things happen and so we gathered our teenagers and were shown to the taxi that the hotel porter was putting our cases in to, and off we went in to the dark and rainy city, expecting a short ride to another hotel. My husband sat in front, me and kids in the back.

A couple of miles in to the journey, the taxi driver asked if we knew how to get to this sister hotel. Husband explained that we had no idea, we were on holiday and had never been here before. Driver hummed and hawed to himself but carried on driving, and about ten minutes later he asked again, where is this hotel. Husband and I exchanged a few looks between us as it was becoming clear the man was unsure of his location, the driver made a couple of calls on his hands free which were not in English so we could not understand what was said, only the rising agitation in his voice. 

More miles and another 15 mins later, we are in a residential area in what appeared to be the arse end of nowhere. The car stopped outside a random house and the driver says words to the effect of, ""here we are, out you get"". We stated that this was very clearly not a hotel, the exchange became heated as he wanted us to leave his car, but we did not want to take our family out on to a dark street that was god knew where, there was no one in sight as it was now late and pitch black out there. 

We refused to get out and asked him calmly to please take us back to the original hotel as he clearly was unable to take us to the sister hotel. The driver was getting really cross and argumentative, my husband is a cool headed bloke and insisted he just return us to the hotel, I was getting super stressed in the back,the kids were getting worried. The driver set off again and was shouting loudly at us, not much of it was comprehensible but it was getting aggressive so my husband rang 911 on his mobile phone and explained what was happening; the police said to stay on the line and look for road names so they could come get us. As my husband continued this conversation with the police, the driver went quiet, changed direction and joined a main road, fairly soon we pulled up back outside the original hotel.

We jumped out, a porter approached the car and began taking bags from the boot, I was in tears with relief and exhaustion and now that we were safe my husband lost his shit with the driver. The driver was asking for his payment, we had been given a voucher to pay him with which my husband ripped up in front of him. The driver started threatening my husband who was telling him in no uncertain terms what a disgrace he was and things were verging on the physical. The porter stepped between my husband and the driver and along with other staff ushered my family back in to the lobby while they dealt with the driver outside. 

The staff couldn't have been nicer, the front desk attendant was so shocked and apologetic as we told them what had happened and called a manager, who put us in to a junior suite for our stay, no transfer now required, and many apologies. 

We have been walked from hotels in other countries, it happens, it's not nice, but this was just a nightmare! It did not get the holiday off to a good start, and I refused to get in any more cabs whilst in Boston, but it's something we still talk about with our now grown up kids, and the rest of the holiday which took us to Cape Cod and New York (in a hired car!) was the best holiday we've ever had. 

TL:DR Cab driver didn't know the location of the hotel we were being 'walked' to and tried to dump us in the dark city, husband called police, the driver reluctantly took us back to original hotel where a fight almost broke out between husband and driver. Hotel put us in a suite for the remainder of our stay.",1,"We got walked by hotel, cab driver couldnt find the sister hotel and tried to ditch us in the middle of nowhere, had to call the cops.

My sister is in a play. The cast decided to go get food at a burger joint. And the people that got their first go in and are very respectful. I go to get my take out food at the bar bc I didn't have any desire to sit and hang out with my 16 old sister's castmates who were probably gonna talk a ton about the play and stuff I've got 0 involvement in. Anyway, they immedaitly tell the staff that there's a large group coming and that they are 100% willing to wait as long as neccesary for space to open up. And they're quietly talking in the waiting area. Not bothering anyone. 

I go outside once I have my food and I'm watching the different cast/crew members walking in and once all the kids have sat down in the available tables that they politley waited for i realize i have no napkins so i go in and i ask for some napkins and have 0 issues. I go to my car and the waitress for the cast is at the table and I'm watching from my car and she looks pissed.

Going as far as refusing to allow my sister pay for her food and leave bc ""the rest of your tsble isn't done"" it was like 20 kids and 10:30 at night. Someone from a different table had to pay for her food so she could leave. And these kids *still* tipped her. Like...the hell? They were *nothing* but nice to you and you refused to allow a 16 year old to pay for her dinner and practically held her hostage and were rude to a bunch of kids because why? 


And i should say these kids were not being louder than expected. Were not running around unruly. And had money for both food and tips. And still tipped the waitress even when she was behaving as if they wouldn't. My sister she got the impression that it was either their age or the size of the group that rubbed the waitress the wrong way but like c'mon you can't be rude before a customer is rude as fuck to you.

I have been going to a popular coffee chain since they have WiFi and open early. I usually go before work and studying at this particular location for a test that I have coming up. First time ordering? It was great. Second time? They made my drink hot instead of iced. Third time? They gave me the wrong drink size. Fourth time? They gave me the absolute wrong drink... selective hearing maybe. All these times past the fourth time have been wrong and it’s been hurting me! I decided to not say anything past the fourth time. I am lactose intolerant and I do not tolerate any dairy product with lactose. I had the last straw when I ordered a soy chai latte with a shot of espresso and they gave me a green tea with a shot of espresso. My stomach really hurt after that because they did not make the drink with the soy I ordered. I left a bad review and moved to another nearby location. I ordered an iced drink with soy at this new location and, they used actual MILK. When I came into work I had so much pain because of this stupid drink that they got wrong. I was even telling the barista earlier that the other location got my orders wrong, continuously. That last event transpired yesterday and that coffee chain has lost a loyal customer. I know intolerance to lactose is not as serious as a dairy allergy, but they could potentially kill someone with a dairy allergy.

TL;DR: I have a lactose intolerance and this coffee chain kept making my drinks with actual milk. I had the last straw and decided I will not support their business anymore.",1,A popular coffee chain has lost a loyal customer.,0

So my mom works at a pottery painting studio, and often when she comes in to work, I come with her and paint since she gets me a massive discount. I sometimes help out when she's closing, too. So, today was any other day, I'm sitting there painting, and all of a sudden, *BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG!*

There's a very loud banging from the wall, almost like someone was too aggressive when nailing something to the wall. It's obvious there's some banging going on in the shop next door, but we only start to worry when we see plates threatening to fall off their stands. We thought it was just someone nailing something to the wall, so we cautiously watched the plates waiting for it to stop.

Long story short, it didnt stop.

Now, since my mom was running the shop alone at that time, I offered to go see what's going on over there, and she said I could. Mind you, I'm 16 and socially awkward and have anxiety, so I'm really proud of myself for doing this. So I go over there, and it some soccer tryouts store? Idk. The door says pull, so I pull, and it's locked. I go back to the studio, the banging is still continuing, so I decide to try knocking.

The guy unlocks the door and opens it, and oh boy what I see behind him. Theres a giant frickin hole in the wall. Like, as if he needed to make a giant hole, and instead of like, idk, using any other method to do it, just used a hammer and went to town. So, awkwardly, I say

(Me: me. WD: Wall dude)

Me: uh, there's a pottery place next door,

WD: Yea, I know

Me: -and the banging is causing plates to threaten to fall, so can you maybe tone it down a bit? I dont work there, btw, I'mjust the messenger.

I dont remember what he said next, but he ended up coming over to the studio. He said something about needing to install a beam in the wall? Idk, but he and my mom ended up working out a solution where he was gonna continue whatever the heck he was doing when the studio wasn't open, and set times so that they could take the plates down the before those times so they didn't fall.

Like I said, not a very ""satisfying"" ending, but still a funny situation. We still dont really know what he was trying to accomplish exactly. Just something about a beam of some sort.",1,The plates!,8

Driving in between two states for an appointment than cannot be canceled. Hit a crater on interstate which immediately takes out the tire (run flat lol) on a German luxury vehicle. Didn't see it ahead of time and it was concrete, not asphalt. Anyways, safely pull over to shoulder and built in button to call for roadside assistance. It's almost 7 and tow won't be available until 9-10. Tow driver is based out of company 70-80 miles away from where it is taking vehicle. This is important to remember!

Call dealership because we know they lock up all access to it after hours. Closed, but we have the number of our salesperson and they say there is a road behind the dealer the tow can drop the car off in. This dealership is in a high crime area. Luxury cars + high crime is bizarre, but guess it works with all those gates? Not the kind of place you want to leave your car overnight.

We wait it out on side of interstate. My spouse's family saves the day and we do car musical chairs to finally get to our destination. This is where it all falls apart! Tow driver cannot find this mysterious road. It is 11 PM and he is 70-80 miles from home. Person I'm riding with asks if he can drop it at house instead. Tow says you'd have to call roadside back because he can't do it without an order and immediately says they (roadside) are going to be useless, and he really does not want to charge us for the tow. Replacement vehicle is same brand. Use button again. First person wasn't even roadside assistance so they transfer us. D is driver. RA is roadside assistance. 

D: Hi, a tow truck currently has my vehicle, but they can't find a way into the dealership and all the gates are locked. Do you have dealer specific instructions of how to get in?

RA: Hi, no unfortunately we do not.

D: Okay, can they drop it off at my house instead?

RA: No. If it is not dropped off at a dealership location, you will be responsible for the cost.

D: But I just told you the dealership is completely locked up? Where is he supposed to put it? On the side of the road??

RA: If there is no access to the dealership, then the tow company has to keep possession of the vehicle.

D: Uhm. You dispatched this guy from 70 miles away. You want him to drive it back another 70 miles tonight and bring it back here again tomorrow? That's ridiculous. 

RA: I have nothing else to tell you ma'am. What is a good callback numer?

D: There's no need to callback. We will settle this now. So you are telling me you want him to drop my car in a high crime area and will not reroute it to my home mere miles away? 

RA: Yes.

D: Okay. I'll deal with this later. Goodbye.

RA: Goodbye, thank you for being a customer. 

Hang up that call and shocked that tow driver was correct in how useless they would be. He got to hear the entire conversation. Must happen a lot which is a sign to probably never press that SOS button again. Gotta find that tow company and give them 5 start ratings everywhere. Dude was amazing.

I'm on crutches due to a recent surgery, and I was exhausted from having run several errands after working all day. I asked my son if he was comfortable going in and ordering on his own (we were just there to get him a sandwich, not me). He was game for it. I was a little apprehensive, because my son is not great with social interactions; he can come off as awkward and annoying. But my foot was killing me so I hoped for the best and sent him in while I stayed in the car.

The employee who took his order was awesome. He repeated his questions about bread and toppings patiently when my son asked him to, he helped my son figure out how to run my credit card, and he had a wonderful, kind attitude throughout the entire transaction. My son came out and told me how nice the guy had been to him. I am going to call today and let his manager know that they have a fantastic employee whose kindness toward my shy, quirky son was very much appreciated. It was a great experience for my son and I couldn't be more grateful.

I liked the challenge it presented and seemed a good game from what I had seen on YouTube. 

I finally convinced my dad to take me into town and while he was off looking at something else I was talking to one of the staff members who looked early 20s and seemed like a nice guy. I was asking if they had it and any other games like it as I love getting lost in them and the more to keep me busy the better. 

The conversation started off normal and he was showing me a few games. He then started asking “oh have you heard of ____?”. It was a game I never heard of so I said no. He did this a few more times but said different names. I continued to say no and ask if they were any good. He just said “nah I just made those up”. 

14 year old me just kinda stood there looking at this guy like “ummm what?”. I am still confused by that interaction to this very day but I pretty sure his goal was for me to just nod along and go “uh huh” or. “Oh yeah! That one!”.

133,Retail_Hell,0,t3_bbqvqo,58,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bbqvqo/you_cannot_refuse_me_service/,"My mom and I went to a sandwich shop for lunch in our area. By what is basic logic, there is ONE line marked for Order Here, and then you kind of follow along the counter while your sandwich is being made to give yes or no to various ingredients.

When I walk in, there is a Karen just kind lingering in the Pick Up area. The employees are kind of puttering around, so I assume that she has already given her order and she is waiting for some event related to her food to happen. (I.E. maybe the employee went to grab some more of an ingredient and she's in stasis so they can put the fresh stuff on her food. Whatever.)

I walk over to the appropriate line and stand directly under the sign that says, in nice big letters, ""Order Here.""

An employee immediately comes over, and my mom and I decide to split something. We place our order -- no problem--, detail our yess's and nos, --still no problem-- and sit back while it's built --now there's a problem.

Karen engages with the real world, and has noticed we're now being assisted. \[Edit to say that she had this really snooty voice, like she could not believe some random peon was in a high quality establishment. (It's a sandwich shop, not Gordon Ramsay's Five Star Restaurant.)\]

&gt;Kaen: ""Excuse me, but I was here before you. You're cutting. You need to be behind me.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Pardon?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: ""You're cutting in line! I was here first! You need to stand behind me.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, we're not in line. We already gave our order, and our sandwich is already being made. It doesn't matter where we stand at this point. The employee who took YOUR order is helping you, and the employee who took OUR order is helping us.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: ""I haven't ordered yet! You cut in front of me!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""...Ma'am, we did not cut in front of you. There was no one in the Order Here line ahead of us. You're in the Pickup Line, where people who have already ordered wait for their food.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: ""I've been standing here for ten minutes, waiting for assistance, and they've been ignoring me! How was I supposed to know that?!""

At this point, I simply stare her in the eye, then dramatically turn and emphatically point at the nice, visible sign.

&gt;Me: ""Well, there's a pretty big clue over there. I would assume that since you're in the Pick Up line, everyone assumed  that someone else was already helping you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: ""WHAT?! I'VE BEEN STANDING HERE! WHY WOULD THEY NOT FIGURE IT OUT IN THAT TIME?!""

Well, I speculated that it could be that :

a) you have NOT been standing there for ten whole minutes, or

b) everyone is clearly doing a job or a task and is simply focused on their own work to the exclusion of the rest of the world, assuming that someone else is helping you --granted this is a mistake on their part, but it's totally understandable, as I'm guilty of the same thing from time to time, or

c) you walked into the building during a moment of distraction, and stood in the wrong line, staring into space without once making a single noise or trying to call attention to yourself.

&gt;Instead of going to the correct line, she screeches: ""EXCUSE ME! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES FOR ASSISTANCE, AND YOU HELPED HER INSTEAD OF ME!""

A manager comes up to the counter. She's smiling in  away that is more a baring of the teeth than a pleasant expression:

&gt;Manager: ""Mrs. \[X\], of *course* we helped them instead of you. Not only did they wait in the actual line, but we haven't banned them, like we have with you.""

...oooor d) this is a banned Karen and they refused her service once already, but she hasn't left yet. Huh... that was not a scenario that I would have imagined before. Live and learn.

&gt;Karen: ""I AM A CUSTOMER! YOU CANNOT REFUSE TO DO YOUR JOB! I WAS HERE FIRST! YOU **CANNOT** SERVE ANYONE ELSE UNTIL YOU SERVE ME!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: ""You are banned. You aren't allowed in here. You will leave in the next ten seconds, or I will call the cops.""

So when I was 16, I helped my dad a lot with radon mitigation jobs. For those of you in the South, radon is a gas quite common up North that gives you lung cancer. If you have it seeping into your house, you get a radon mitigation system installed, which usually requires me completely sealing up your crawl space while my dad rigs up the pipes and wires the fan to suck all that bad gas out of your house and shoot it up into the sky. That's a little ELI5 but you get the idea. You don't wear nice clothes because you're going to get dirty. At the time, we lived in the South of the North. Some of you know what state that is...


So we're in the middle of this massive job, one of the largest crawl spaces I've ever had to mess with, and we decide that homemade pb&amp;j sandwiches just aren't going to cut it. So let's take a decent lunch break and go get some *Eat-Mor-Chikin* (It was close.)


We jump in the truck, head to the restaurant, park, and walk inside. As soon as we enter (while covered in dirt and dust and just looking like complete shit) I noticed the cashier girl just kind of... Very intently watching us approach. 


(For those of you that don't know, Eat-Mor-Chikin is a... Fairly religious company, as far as fast food restaurants go. This is sometimes reflected in their hiring practices. Not saying there's anything wrong with that, but it was definitely reflected in this particular employee.)


Girl: Hello there! How are y'all doin' on this blessed day?

Dad (Oblivious): We're good. I'll have a (whatever) and whatever he wants. (Pointing to me).

Girl (almost choking up): Oh! Oh is this your son? Well bless your heart, you poor thing. You know what? I do think I have a buy one get one coupon around here, yes I do! But really, you just order whatever you want to, ok? 

Me: Um, ok... I want the (whatever. The big one, I was 16 and hungry). 


Girl: You got it sugar! How about I make that a large for free? I have another coupon right here! 


Me: Wow, yeah. Thanks. 


My dad is still completely unaware at this point but I know exactly what is going on. She thinks we are ""dirty homeless hobos,"" here to splurge on some Chikin! So Dad finishes up the order and pays with cash that he pulls out of his pocket, because of course he does, we get our cups and go wait for our order to be called. But as we're walking away, she says one last thing.


Girl: That'll be up soon, guys! And just so ya know, I'ma pray for y'all to get back on your feet just as soon as can be!

And I couldn't help but smile big and reply, ""Well thanks! That'll be pretty soon, since we'll have this job finished in about 4 more hours. But I'm definitely looking forward to the shower tonight and whatever my Mom made for dinner!""


Realizing we were actually just working some kinda dirty job and weren't a homeless dad and son coming in off the street to Bask in the Glory that was Eat-Mor-Chikin, the check out girl's expression basically just changed to one of... Bitter Disappointment. Like, she would have preferred it if we were Homeless...

&amp;#x200B;

Our sewer started backing up through our basement floor drain two weeks ago today, so I called a plumbing company (Mob Mamilton) to come clean out the main line. We had used them in the past to remove tree roots, and had seemed to be nice, though a bit pushy. They got someone out promptly and cleaned it out, and we scheduled a follow up with the video camera scope for the following Tuesday so we could arrange for my husband to be home. Saturday evening when I did a load of laundry, it started coming back up. We thought it could possibly just be the part of the pipe from the washer, so figured we would just wait until Tuesday to see what was going on since the appointment was scheduled anyway, but then when I showered Monday night, water came up the floor drain again. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the camera guy showed up Tuesday, he couldn’t see anything on the camera past a certain point because there was so much sewage backed up. They called out a guy to clean the line again, but he apparently couldn’t make it clear out, it would go through, but then the camera still couldn’t see anything. We had to take this on faith though, because they never told us when they were trying to run the camera through so we didn’t see anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

They said we likely had a break in the line somewhere, and that it was probably at the transition point where the sewer pipe changed from cast iron to clay in front of the house. They said it would cost $3500 to dig it out and try to diagnose the issue. My husband was not happy about paying that kind of money just to find out what the problem is, so he started digging a hole on his own, while I started making phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the city to find out what kind of permits were involved for this kind of work (we are DIY’s for a lot of things) and quickly got a headache trying to deal with it, they passed me around to so many different people, but it became clear that this wasn’t really something we wanted to (or really could) do ourselves. Plus, we didn’t even know where the problem was. I kept envisioning my husband making it down to the sewer line and having raw sewage spilling out in the hole and having to deal with it. So I called a different plumber (BB Gray) to come give us an estimate for repairs (free of charge, fortunately).

&amp;#x200B;

This guy came out with a bigger camera and was able to get it past the blockage. I stopped my husband from digging (about 6 feet down) and he had us watch as he snaked the line and we were able to see exactly what the problem was, a section of the pipe under our house was basically gone. As he snaked it, he made a point of using a detector and the camera to figure out how far we would need to repair it if we decided to take care of everything we were responsible for, then gave us different quotes based on different options, and encouraged us to get quotes from other companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called one other company for a quote (Lightbulb), and Mob Mamilton again, figuring we could give them a chance. Lightbulb plumbing had a different process for repairing the pipe that we didn’t feel as comfortable using, and Mob Mamilton gave us a quote that was about the same as we had been quoted by the BB Gray, but it wasn’t itemized, and we knew for a fact it didn’t include some things that the first quote had included, such as removing and replacing the sidewalk (because, ""It may not need to be replaced""). We liked the transparency of the quote we received from BB Gray, so we went with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

We called BB Gray Wednesday morning and asked them to do the work. Thursday morning, once they got the permits in order, they came and quickly dug out the three holes necessary to thread through the new pipe (the old pipe was so trashed in one place that it wasn’t safe to try to do it with only two holes) and by the end of the day, they had a temporary set up so we could wash dishes and takes showers again. The next day, they replaced the main stack, which had been leaking for a really long time. As part of the replacement, they removed one of our toilets that had a leak, to replace the flange. When I realized they were removing the toilet, I asked if they could replace it with a new one if I bought it, rather than the old leaky one we needed to replace anyway, and they said yes. Saved us some work there, and now we have a much more efficient toilet that isn’t losing a gallon of water every 5 minutes (estimate from the plumber as they saw how much water was leaking down once the pipes were cut.)

When they left Saturday, they were just waiting on an inspection from the city, so they left the holes open, but we were able to use the basement again (just kept the laundry room door closed) and now the cement has been poured down there and I just have to wait for it to cure so I can put my laundry room back together. Fortunately for me, my mother-in-law lives across the street, so we are able to do laundry at her house and were able to use her toilets when ours were out of commission.

This happened about 15 years ago. It was the weekend, and I lived half a block away from my grocery store. This was in Hollywood, CA. A very multicultural neighborhood. I walked down the street to get a bottle of wine and some snacks, and was not in any rush whatsoever. The store was very busy (it’s a large chain, and the major store in the area) and all of the lines were at least 5-7 people deep. 

So I get in line right behind an old woman. When she gets to the front and the cashier is checking her out, she takes the looongest time to do everything. Slowly putting her purse on the counter. Slowly getting out her rewards card. Then proceeds to write the slooooowest check ever. Everyone in line, including me standing right behind her, starts doing the shuffling and loud sighing. We (especially Me) are not being subtle about our impatience. 

She FINALLY tears her check from the checkbook and slowly hands it to the cashier. As she does so, her sleeve moves up her arm and I see serial-like numbers tattooed on her forearm. F**K!!! Yeah, she’s a Holocaust Survivor. I’m already 4ft, 11 1/2 inches. I shrank another foot that day. :( 

I believe she was a Survivor because it was, and still is, a very Russian and Jewish neighborhood.

That was the LAST time I ever gave attitude to anyone else (worker or fellow customer) at a store. I have a good life. It could be a lot harder, and it certainly is for other people. I don’t need to add sh*t to someone else who is going through stuff I can’t even imagine.

And no, I didn’t apologize or say anything. I was a dumb 20 something year old who was too ashamed to own up to my selfishness.",1,"Was being impatient in line, then felt like an idiot.",30

I was originally informed that it would only take 2 weeks for the office to call me to set up an appointment with them.   I waited from October until end of February this year before the call finally came.

When the women finally called, I was surprised.  I had completely forgotten about it all.  That's okay, the woman was nice and set me up an appointment for as soon as possible.  It was originally set up for April 29th, and even then that was kind of a last minute throw me on the schedule.  Super nice of her.

About two weeks ago, she calls me again and let's me know that they had an opening and could I come in sooner  (last Monday).  Of course, I jumped at the chance.  Yes!  Let's get this done!  I was stoked.

....Then the ball dropped.  They aren't setting me up with the somewhat closer place (2 hrs drive to get there), but the one that is 4 hours away.  Crap.  Sigh.  Okay, take a deep breath.  We both called out of work, and begged the babysitter to please watch the hellions.  It cost about $200,after everything was done.  Husband would drive there, I'd drive back and we'd just make a day of it all.

Mind you, we live where it's still snowing and polar vortex hell.  When we made the trip, there was still 5 ft of snow in my front yard.  There were accidents, delays, and a slew of detours.  We even left an hour and a half early for the 4 hour drive. 

While driving, I realized we would be a bit late.  13 minutes late.  Crap.  I called about 2 hrs into the trip to let them know we were running late and asked if we should continue driving, because there was no safe way to make up the time.  They said it was fine, but if we'd be any later than that to call back.

About 1 hour left on our drive, GPS is showing we'd be about 16 minutes later (it was actually 14).  I called again to give them an update on our status.  The girl on the phone says it's not a huge deal and to just show up sometime within our hour appointment slot.  Okay, cool.  Phew.

We finally get there, 14 minutes late.  Check in, and we are told the doctor has left for the day.  ""What?  It's only 3:14, and you told me to come...plus your office doesn't close until 5pm?  I just drove a very long time to get here.""  Sorry she's gone.  Reschedule.  How about fuck no.  I won't be going back.  Too long of a drive, too costly, no.

Get home and my oldest daughter tells me the doctor's office called the house phone while we were driving home.  They were told specifically to call my cell, and shouldn't even have my house number.  Apparently the girl asked if I was there and when she was told I wasn't available, she told my 12 yr old ""Just fucking forget it"" and then hung up on her.

I've left reviews for them, and told my original referral doctor not to refer anyone else to them.  Thanks for the wasted money, gas, time, and huge headache.  I will never go back and will warn everyone else about you.  All you had to do was say ""nope, just turn around""...  The drive home took another 6 hrs, due to it being night time mid through the drive.  Fucking awful.

Edit:  Someone PMed me to ask.  It was for a biopsy to make sure my breast cancer did not spread.  We live in the sticks and had to drive over state lines to get it done in a place with the correct equipment  (according to what they told me).  Still no word yet on when or where I'll get it done at for real.  Hopefully, at the closer place this time.

Before now, I was cancer free for 2 years and then my health took a nose dive again.  Lots of tests later and we had to get the biopsy scheduled.  Yes, I did forget about the biopsy as I was still seeing my normal doctor once a month and my stats were looking a bit better.

Update:  I did speak to my insurance company and let them know what happened.  I did get scheduled for my ""usual"" biopsy doctor.  It's at the place 2 hrs away (not the one in this story).  I did get to call the specialist's office this week and told the ""CFO"" (Operations Manager of that Department?), what had happened. I got a lot of empty ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and nothing really else. The guy didn't even really seem sorry, or promise it wouldn't happen to anyone else. He just kind of brushed me off.

This just happened less than a half hour ago. My husband and I like to frequent local restaurants instead of going to chains because the pricing is usually similar but the food is better. We don't have a car so we walk everywhere. I hadn't eaten since lunch time &amp; was starting to get a hunger headache by the time my husband came home from work.

Tonight we decided we would go to a BBQ joint about 1.5 miles from our house. They sell smoked meats, homemade sides, house-made sauces, etc. It's a carnivore's dream come true. The only bad thing about the restaurant is that it's small (only 10 tables, 4 seats at each table). 

Every table was full so I understood when our food took a little longer to come to the table, but by the time we got our food I had finished my glass of water &amp; my husband finished his soda. Our waitress asks if we need refills &amp; we said yes. She brought my husband's but never brought me any water. She comes by and asks 3 times if I need a refill &amp; each time I tell her yes, I do. 

I was not able to eat my food in the restaurant without a drink so when she came back to the table a fourth time I asked if I could just get a to-go box &amp; a water to go. She asked ""Did I ever bring you a refill?"" I was honest with her &amp; told her no. She started apologizing over &amp; over and saying how she had half the restaurant so she forgot. I told her don't worry about it, I really just want to pay and leave. There's nothing that can be done to rectify the situation anyway.

I only left a 10% tip even though I almost didn't want to leave one at all. I understand that things get hectic sometimes, but as a former waitress there really is no excuse for not getting a refill as soon as you notice an empty drink. She had plenty of time to stop &amp; chat up the table behind us but couldn't take a minute to bring me a new drink.",1,I couldn't get a refill,11
146,macmoosie,0,t3_bbb08k,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bbb08k/sour_experience_at_the_local_pharmacy/,"Let me first preface this by saying I've been using the same pharmacy since I was a child. We moved around four times since I was born, but all in the same one mile radius, so we kept the same pharmacy inside of the local grocery supermarket. Even now that we've moved to another part of town with three other pharmacies closer, we still kept the same pharmacy. I've never really needed many prescriptions in my life; some allergy medication, an antibiotic or two, etc. until recently, I have essentially a lifetime prescription for preventative medication through my PCP. Nothing major, nothing serious, I just like to keep my private life private, so I won't name the medication, but I'm in great health. Hooray!

Well, as such, I have minimal experience with getting prescriptions refilled or any such nature, so when I noticed I only had a few pills left, I called in the refill. I didn't know that I could get the prescription refilled automatically if I provide the automated answering robot thing the prescription number. I was at work and wanted to get the prescription refilled to pick up on the way home, so I didn't have that number handy. However, no one at the pharmacy was answering the phone. It kept going to the automated answering system. I work in the medical field so I know through experience that either the pharmacy was busy and they weren't able to pick up the phone, or they were deliberately ignoring it. I wasn't able to use the automated service due to not having the prescription number and I wasn't given an option to hold for the next available pharmacist or technician. I called back a couple of times afterward to no avail.

So, logically, I hung up and called back, pressing 0 for customer service in the supermarket instead of the pharmacy. CR will be customer service, PH for pharmacist, and Me for...well, me.

*CR: Thank you for calling Such and Such, how may I help you?*

*Me: Hi, could I have the pharmacy please? I tried calling a few times but couldn't reach someone to speak with.""*

*PH: And the prescription?*

*Me: \*insert name here\**

*PH: Okay, done. You’ll get a text when it’s ready.*

*Me: Okay, thank you.*

A few hours passed and I got the notification it was ready for pickup. I left work, went to the gym, and scooted over to the pharmacy to pick it up. When I got there, the technician took care of me and when I gave her my last name, the pharmacist, who I assume I spoke with over the phone, looked up.

*PH: You know, you can use the automated service to order refills.*

*Me: Yeah, I didn’t have the prescription number handy so I couldn’t refill it that way, I had to wait to speak to someone. I called a few times but couldn’t get through and I wasn’t given the option to hold for someone to take the call.*

*PH: Well, write it down or put it in your phone. We’re busy and don’t have time to answer phones for that. That’s why we have the automated service.*

*Me: Okay. I’m sorry to be an inconvenience, I just wanted to get it refilled as soon as possible so I wouldn’t have to miss a dose. I wasn’t sure about the time-frame between requesting the refill and being able to pick it up.*

*PH: Mhm.*

At this point, the technician just rolled her eyes and then smiled at me, handing me the pharmacy paper bag, whispering that the pharmacist was in a foul mood all day and to just ignore him.

*Technician: I hope you have a great night, macmoosie.*

*Me: Thanks, you as well.*

Needless to say, when I got back in my car, I noted the prescription number in my iPhone’s notepad thing for future reference.

I’ve been going to that pharmacy for years and I’ve never had to deal with any kind of unpleasantness before. The whole situation just caught me completely off guard, but I wasn’t about to waste more energy on it.

I recently moved into an appartement, which had piss-poor internet.
So when I learned that my appartement was optic-fiber compatible, I asked my ISP to get it installed.

So I take an appointement, and I'm told that a technician should come by Monday at 12' PM. Perfect for me since I don't work between 12Pm and 14pm.
Well it would have been perfect if he came before 13'45pm when I have to leave for work. 
Luckily my wife was there so he could work anyway. Except for the fact that he did not bring his tools, did not know where he was supposed to connect the fiber, and was all around incompetent.

So, obviously, I have to schedule a 2nd appointement, which was supposed to happen at 10'am of course he did not show up before 14'PM because why should he be on time ? But this time he had his tools, and I knew where he was supposed to connect the cable (because he sure as fuck did not).
Excepted that to connect the fiber he has to make it go through a wall, of course there are holes already there to be used, so no problem. But he did see a problem, there was a wire already in there. This wire is an helpers, you're supposed to tie your cable to this wire, and use it to get it through to the other side. I did not know this at first, and the technician, who'se job it is to know that, did not either.

For the third appointement I made sure to get sent someone else, who came on time, did his work quickly, and got everything done perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a cloud service provider, a big big one. I'm currently on medical leave, but agreed to help my little brother with his business' email migration.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother doesn't know much about computers. He sells used sport gear. He has 20 in Charisma. He has a degree in Journalism. He has a Macbook he uses for work emails and Facebook. I love him, but I got the nerdy.

&amp;#x200B;

His current mail service provider, who is also hosting his website and sold him his domains, knows that. So he's been taking advantage of it. Since he's someone his partner knows, my brother trusted him. Until the second time he lost all his emails.

&amp;#x200B;

The service provider (Let's call him SP) has a server in his basement and that's what he uses for his services. Except he obviously have no idea how to do that. Twice in the past, his server crashed and he lost all of my brother's emails. When my brother called him to ask if it was possible to get them back, he said he didn't have time and that he would call back. He never did. So it happened again, and my brother decided to get a quote for another more reliable service. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, SP is an asshole and doesn't want my brother to leave. So he decided to make it as impossible as possible for my brother to leave. My brother had been asking for access to his domains for about 2 months before I got involved. SP kept saying that he couldn't do that, because of X and Y. Or that he didn't have time to do it now. Or he just didn't answer.

&amp;#x200B;

So when I got on the phone with him and he started to bullshit me, I started to explain to him how things work and how he could do the things we were asking for. I even contacted the company he resells from (GoMommy) to get the how-to and sent all that to him by email. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a back-and-forth for about two weeks. He would find any reason to not give me access, ghost me, ask for payment but not provide the payment information, etc. Finally, yesterday, I got access to the domains and start changing the contact information. That's when my brother calls me.

&amp;#x200B;

""Is it possible the changes you made broke my emails?"" Uh, no. So I try to access the webmail, it doesn't work. I try to access my brother's business website, nada. His SP's website isn't working either. I try to send an email and trace it, but it's pending status. So I call SP.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't answer me, but before I can finish my voicemail, I get a text message from him. ""Power cut"" Sorry, what? He sends me a map of our electricity company showing his location doesn't have power. I tell him 'I know, but don't you have any backup?' No answer.

It has now been almost 24 hours since my brother, his SP and all his clients have had no service. Because that dumbass doesn't have any plan for if his server is down. So I'm still waiting for that.

151,NYCAddy,0,t3_bbdv5s,3,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bbdv5s/logistics_company_commits_series_of_blunders/,"I just need to vent a little bit. Let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for this. First we live in a large city on the east coast and deal with a fair amount of delivery issues as our buzzer has been broken for over a year. Last Wednesday we were supposed to receive a 60lb delivered by the brown logistics company(BLC for short). We signed a note through their website allowing them to leave the package. The package was not left and a missed delivery slip was left on our door. The next day we signed again and put the signed slip on the door, but due to a misunderstanding the slip was removed before the delivery was attempted and we got another slip on the door. The next day, the day of the final delivery attempt, we taped both signed delivery slips to our door with blue tape to make sure they were obviously not left by BLC. We also planned on waiting by the front door (we live in an apartment on the third floor) to wait for the package during the 11:45-1:45 delivery window. At 11:26 we got a message that the final delivery attempt had been made, was unsuccessful, and the package was being returned to the sender. For clarity, every other day the delivery attempt was within 15 minutes of noon. We went downstairs and not only was there not a new slip on the door, the ones attached with blue tape were still there. I do not think the driver once attempted to actually deliver the 60lb package. Even if he did, he somehow did not know that he was allowed to leave it, or did not care.

The next step was to call customer service and, after making it clear that the driver did not even attempt a delivery, they told us the dispatcher would call us within the hour to let us know what was happening. Around half an hour later the dispatcher called us and said that the package would be delivered to us by the end of the day. Not that it might be delivered if the driver had time, but that it would be delivered. We waited all day, checking the door every half hour until 7:30 when we checked online and saw that the local customer support center was closed.

We called customer service again and after a ten minute conversation with a representative who kept apologizing and saying there was nothing he could do, I managed to get him to transfer me to his supervisor. The supervisor told me he was going to let them know to reroute the package back to us, the original recipients. He said Monday was the earliest they could modify the delivery. The next day(Saturday) we called customer service again just to make sure these instructions were included in the information. We were trying to be careful as at least twice now we were told one thing and another happened. So we get a supervisor fairly quickly this time (After the representative seemed to have no idea what I was talking about) and he said the warehouse, or dispatch center wouldn’t be open until Monday, but he would put another note in the file, but we should check Monday to make sure.

About fifteen to twenty minutes later we got a call from a manager of that facility saying he saw that there were two notes and he would ensure it got to us, the original recipient.

Monday we call customer service and after I prod them to confirm our address, they say it is going to us, the original recipient, and it will be there by the end of the day. I am skeptical as the online information has not changed since Friday and still says “Returning.”
At 6:00 we call customer service again and, what do you know, it has been returned to the sender. All of the calls, all of the notes, all of the online signatures, and we still do not have our package.

We called this morning and, while seemingly sympathetic, there is nothing they can do with us anymore. The shipper has it and can re-ship it for free, but they can’t do anything. THey did assure me, however, that the driver’s supervisor has the information, and while that may help prevent this from happening in the future, it doesn’t help us now.

I do not understand how a logistics company can make so many mistakes on one package. This feels like the driver was lazy, and then at least two more people were lazy or bad at their jobs for this to happen. What more could we have done to get our package? There is no number to call other than customer service and even numbers we received calls from could not be reached. They were “non-working (BLC) number(s).” It also seemed like the customer service default is “you must have messed up” and it took a fair amount of convincing to get them to believe we had not messed up, they had. How does a company get away with this level of incompetence.

Just for closure since this just happened, the seller refunded us instead of reshipping it for free through BLC. I assume this is because it was a promotional price, but we'll be in touch with them.

TLDR: Driver never attempted to deliver package and through a series of screw ups, despite doing everything this logistics company empowers a receiver to do, it was sent back to the shipper, who refunded it instead of shipping it back for free.",1,Logistics company commits series of blunders.,6

There were two people behind the counter and the store was not very busy. I ordered from a lady and my friend was ordering from the other person behind the counter. When I was ordering, she asked me what I wanted for sides. I totally missed the sign saying what the sides were and got really flustered. I eventually picked what I wanted and we went to check out.

She asked me what my ticket number was. Me being dumb completely forgot to grab a ticket from the pulley-thing, so I ran to the other end of the shelves and got one. 

She then rung me up and was boxing up my meal and I asked her for some ketchup. She looked me in the eyes and said “anything else” in a very tired tone. At this point, I’m freaking out and am getting really dizzy. I said no thank you and she rung me up.

The total came out to $4.40 and I tried putting in my rewards card. I tried it three times and it kept getting denied. I was on the verge of a panic attack and gave up. I pulled out my wallet to get a $5 and a $10 fell out. I handed her the five and put the other bill back in my wallet. 

The cashier was obviously annoyed with my awkwardness and constant apologetics. She handed me back my change and put the PAID sticker on my box. I went to count my change and she gave me $5.60. I was trying to hand her back the $5 and said “I’m sorry, but I think I gave you a five, not a ten.”

She gently pushed my hand away and said in a fairly loud tone. “You gave me a ten, not a five. I know how to do my job, sweetheart.” I awkwardly put the money back in my wallet and looked at my friend for help.

My friend overheard what happened and saw that my face was really red. She sat me down in the dining section and finished paying for her order.

A quick handshake and introduction later he unlocks the front door to the house and ushers us inside, after saying that due to the internal frame of the building it might be hard to get a lender to fund a purchase.

Once inside he quickly shows us the lounge, says a few brief words about it and then whisks us into the kitchen. He indicates a downstairs toilet in a little niche just to the side of the kitchen and is already opening the back door on the other side of the kitchen before we’ve had a proper look.

Here’s one bedroom, another bedroom, the last bedroom/office - bathroom is over there. Then quick down the stairs it was, back into the lounge, any questions and out we went. He gets back in his car and then disappears after speedily pulling away. 

All in all, the viewing took 3 minutes and left us wondering if there was a reason behind the mad rush this guy was in, and concluded that perhaps he was touching cloth and needed to get the hell out of there before he turned his trousers brown",1,Shown a house at the weekend by an estate agent that possibly needed a poo,9

When I was pregnant with my second daughter, I had severe hyperemisis gravidarum. I lost over 80lbs while I was pregnant, had home IV infusions twice a week, a 24/7 anti emetics pump, and toward the end, I had an NG tube. It was not pleasant, and was very debilitating. Right around this time, several local places were starting to promote grocery delivery, which I was SO THANKFUL for because I could barely stand without puking, let alone drive.

The man who came to deliver my groceries is a man I will NEVER forget, and now, I realize, my oldest daughter won't either.

First time he came to the house he knocked and I answered, in pajamas and scooting with my IV pole. He had unloaded all my groceries into my garage, but as soon as he saw me he said ""There is no way in hell I am going to expect or even let you bring the groceries in! Normally this is against policy but this just won't do!""
He brought my whole order (300$ worth of food) into the house, and even offered to help me put it away as his next order was close and he had another 2 hours in his delivery window. All the while he was so nice and listened to all the crazy stuff from my bored toddler.
I'd like to add that I live at a busy intersection, and don't have a driveway that is big rig friendly, so he had to park in a lot across the intersection, and cart all the goods over and up the hill to my driveway.

From that point on for the better part of almost a year, this guy came every week, sometimes twice if I forgot something with my first order. When he came, he brought stickers for my daughter (and a balloon and candy for Valentines day, and a stuffed toy another time) dog treats for my dogs, and was so unbelievably helpful. 

I tried to tip him once, but he explained that if he ever got caught, it was grounds for dismissal.

He even took a vacation to Disneyland with his own kids, and while he was gone, left special instructions for my order for his fill in driver. And now that I'm typing this I remember he brought my daughter back a giant lollipop lol

At an absolutely grueling and awful time for myself and my family, this guy was so awesome, and was nothing short of an amazing human being.

He always smiled, was positive, helpful, and never made me feel any worse than I already did, even when I knew I was probably sometimes cranky, whiney, smelly (showering was hard for me to do alone, my husband or home nurse had to help) and otherwise toward the end with the weight loss and NG tube, I'm sure I looked painfully awful as well.
None of that ever phased this man.

I did make sure corporate and his boss knew how awesome he was. I took it upon myself to write formal letters and mail them instead of using online feedback.

He has since moved on to other work, but I will never forget him sitting with my daughter, on the floor with legos, trying to distract her while the home health nurse struggled to get a line for my IV.

I felt I needed to share this because the last time I shared a story it was negative. When my daughter asked me about the ""food man"" at dinner, I thought it would be a good way to even the playing field.",1,Grocery delivery changed my life,2927

&amp;#x200B;

It's the first time I post here, but I thought I could share a small anecdote from many years. I don't know if this story really belong in r/TalesFromTheCustomer. Please, let me know if I do something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

This story is from many years ago. I was barely a teenager at the time. Our family is not exactly wealthy, so when my father received his pay, one day he decided to bring my mother and me to the fanciest restaurant he can afford with that money. We heard about a certain sushi place that had good reviews so we decided to try.

Things didn't start very well. It appears that the restaurant only served sushi some days of the week and that day wasn't one of them. We decided to stay regardless and try some fancy food. I was quite young and many years have passed since that day, but I remember quite vividly that the other customers were really posh, and some of them were glaring at us during the meal, so it was a little uncomfortable. I remember that a couple was wearing what I thought were pajamas. I swear. The food was good, but nothing special...

When the moment to pay arrived, my father gave a 500€ to the waiter to pay for the whole meal. I know that many places don't even accept that kind of money, but still. Moments later, the chef of the restaurant came to our table and sat with us. We thought it was quite rude because he didn't even asked if he could. He just took a chair and sat down. He was carrying the tip jar with him and proceed to give us the change in small coins. That was even more embarrassing. But we didn't thought much about that at that moment.

Since he was there, we complaint that the restaurant was really cold since we were sitting next to a window that apparently couldn't close properly. Then he hastily asked if ""we came from the tropics because we were so cold"". Is this a proper way to retort to a customer's complaint? He may have been joking, but it wasn't very respectful. 

&amp;#x200B;

We payed. We left and never came back to that place again.",1,"""Where do you come from? Are you from the tropics?""",13

A really nice employee talked to me and helped me when the machine didn’t work. The next week I go in but this week I was really nervous as I went in because I had a fencing competition this week. I go to the back, grab my yorkies but as I get to the till I hear someone shout my name. I was scared thinking they thought I was going to steal them or something but it was nice employee. She told me not to be so nervous (it was very clear from my facial expression) and that I would ace the fencing competition. She then told me that she was going to give me the yorkies for free.

Also I am not sure where this belongs to so please leave a comment where this post would fit in.

So I recently dealt with the most lazy customer representative via email in my life.
About a month ago now there was a huge maintenance in this game I was playing. Due to this maintenance I was accidentally logged off my game and wasn't able to log onto my game using my Google which I had originally had it logged into. So luckily for me I had experienced this in the past with previous games and I remembered I've saved screenshots of my user name and game ID number. I looked for the help button in the game because everytime I tried to log in it kept asking me to make a new account. When I emailed the developers of the game I kindly asked them if they could please retrieve my game damn, I also added that I had already tried all the steps to try to login myself and wasn't able to. This is when I provided them my original screenshots of my game before I got logged off and new screenshots of my guest account. I asked them kindly if they could please manually transfer the data to overwrite my guest data so I can be able to play my original game data again. 

So for 3 weeks these people made it a living hell for me and refused to help me even though I had described to them that I was able to login. They 1st told me my account was connected to Facebook which it wasn't anymore it was connected to Google when I got logged off because of maintenance. The person who was replying to me was stubborn and kept insisting that I was logged into Facebook which he only knew with the information I provided him....

That is when I kept telling me I haven't used Facebook in a while but was logged into Google. To prove that I wasn't connected to Facebook I would send him screenshots that my game data wasn't recovered with Facebook but just kept logging me into face linking both accounts. This person would still refuse to help me and kept giving me the same instructions on how to log into Facebook then he told me to deactivate the game inside the Facebook website when this person noticed that there was now 2 linked accounts with Facebook WHICH I TOLD THIS PERSON FROM THE VERY START THAT I WASN'T USING FACEBOOK! 

At this point he started blaming me because there was 2 linked accounts with Facebook despite me telling him for 3 weeks I wasn't using Facebook. That is when I emailed back to file a complaint, I was extremely frustrated and angry that I kept telling them the same thing over and over again that their methods wasn't working and I was desperately begging them if they could see my damn account to just retrieve it from their data base which they already had up and could see everything but where lazy to do it. 

I told them that I wanted a refund for everything I spent into the game if they kept refusing to transfer the data onto my device. That is when they contacted the damn manager, the manager asked for an email of the last purchase I did to verify that I in fact was dead serious that I wanted a refund and when the manager realized I was spending a good amount of money in the game they finally said they would transfer over my data and overwrite the guest data. This was last week. This is the kicker even though they had multiple emails me begging over and over again to do what the manager was offering me they still kept asking me if I was sure. I wanted to pull my hair out. This person asked me twice even after I told them which data I wanted back and which to remove. They asked me to provide the same information and screenshots which drove me up the wall. I don't understand how difficult it was to understand that is what I wanted. 

My friend who was around when this was going in told me they should compensate me because around the time I got logged off I had paid for a subscription that only lasted 14 days and I was well over the 14 day subscription. I wasn't asking for a refund I just wanted them to compensate me what I would of received if I wasn't logged off for in game currency. I should of known they wouldn't of done it because they gave me a hard time for 3 weeks. So I ended up calling Google play and they refunded my money when I showed them the huge chain email. I'm still waiting for my bank to show my refund but in the end I ended up with my game and with my money back. 

Oh yeah I forgot to add after I agreed for the manager to transfer over the data it literally took this person a freaking day!!! A DAY!! I SPENT 3 WEEKS FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING THAT TOOK A DAY TO RECOVER!",1,Stupid or Lazy Customer Service Representative,11

Something made me think of this nightmare, and Thought of sharing it with you guys. 

Online, I had ordered a 3kg red liquorice bag. I payed with my own credit card, on my own profile. 

Some time pass, until I get messages that my parcel is on route, and will be arriving sometime later that day. Delivery service: well known 3 letters. 

I hope wishfully that every 3letters delivery truck Driving up and down our street, will be carrying my yummy sweets.

But by the end of that afternoon, I got another notification saying it got dropped off, at the local ""drop store"", since they couldn't locate my street.

So I send my husband down to pick it up; He returns with a parcel, that was registered in his name. I knew straight off, it wasn't meant for us. It didn't even have our adress nor my name on it. So he went back to shop.

The personnel there, were surprised by how a parcel, not being for us, could pop up in their system, AND with their scanner, show husband's name. When clearly, it wasn't our adress written on parcel.  Thinking their system had messed up, they tried to locate owner of said strange parcel. The logic was, if we had his parcel, he must have our yummy liquorice. Turned out there was no one with such name, in a town called Vendays. Nor did the adress exist. 

Further frustrated, the personnel had no clue where our parcel was. So my husband went back home, and on behalf of me, contacted [online website]. That told us they had nothing to do with it, as they've given it over to the delivery service. 

Contacting 3letters delivery service, was no help either. They demanded a slip for the parcel, which we didn't have, as the notification said our adress was ""unrecognizable"".

They argued that was impossible, as they had proofs that other parcels had arrived to this adress. However they also had clear proof, that our parcel had been dropped off at the shop, and that the driver had tried to deliver it. 

A little bit of corresponding between husband and them, made us no closer to our package. So we opened up a complaint, and left it at that.

The next day we get a phone call from the shop, they had found our parcel. Somehow [3letter delivery service] had registered my parcel in my husband's name, at the adress of my MIL. Yes we *do* live in one of my MIL's many houses, but I had used the delivery adress as the one, we lived in. It does have its own adress!

The written adress plus name on parcel, was how I had ordered it, with my name. But by scanning it, it popped up in my husband's name, with MIL's adress...

So the personnel had gone through every parcel, which isn't few. However they function only half time as a location spot, for our small town for parcels. In fact it's truly a hotel; they had scanned every parcel, and finally found the one belonging, but not registered, to me. 

How [3letter delivery service], could even fuck up like this is beyond me.

But I got my sweets, and we kept the complaint open; since then, we've ordered a few items, and [3letters] have had no trouble locating our adress. 

Though we did refuse one item on arrival, as the packaging was covered in paint. As if a bucket had exploded next to it. The guy delivering it, tried telling us they had received it as such, and that it must be our item leaking... The item in question was plastic sheets you put on Windows!

If we do get a choice, we chose any other option but the 3letter delivery service, but often it is none negotiable.",1,"3 letter delivering service messed up, making it out to be our fault.",8

I am completely blind and have had a guide dog since three years ago. Surprisingly few people know what a guide dog is, what makes a dog a guide dog, or how to treat a guide dog and their owner (at least in my country), and this has caused me a few interesting encounters at stores and restaurants. I thought this would be a good place to share some, hopefully this will be informative or funny to someone.
It's important to know that, in my country, and in most countries, the guide dog goes wherever the owner goes. The ONLY places a guide dog cannot enter are restaurant kitchens and operating rooms.
These are short, but I thought one longer post would be better for these. TL;DR after each one.



A few months ago, I went to a breakfast place, pretty close to the city center.
As I entered with my friend, a waiter quickly came up to us and informed us that we could not bring dogs into the building. I politely explained that I was blind and my dog was not a pet, rather a service animal. He skeptically replied that we could sit down and wait for him to speak to the manager. I get really nervous in these situations and I was ready to call the police at any point.
2 minutes later, the manager comes to our table and very nicely apologizes for her waiter's misinformation, tells us my dog is, of course, welcome to stay, and even asks me if they could bring us water for him. Just then the waiter shows up, apologizes as well, and gives us one of the biggest cookies I have ever seen as an apology.

TL;DR: Waiter reluctantly lets me into restaurant, goes to check with owner, who comes to apologize with a humungous cookie for me and my friend.


This was my nicest experience of this sort. Most of them, sadly, have not been this pleasant.

Sometime last year I went with my friend to a kebab place in my town. We went in, made our order, and sat at the table.
Suddenly, a waiter and the person I assumed was the manager walk quickly toward us and tell us that we had to leave because of the dog (who was busy calmly lying down next to my chair and licking his genitals without doing anything to be noticed). As I opened my mouth to explain, literally everyone at the restaurant (maybe 8 to 12 more people) start telling them that they were not allowed to do this, that he was a guide dog and that he had to let me stay there. They very quickly backed down and left without a word. I was so thankful to everyone there and they probably saved my dinner, as it is usually impossible to get past the language barrier at these places, and I cannot make myself understood.

TL;DR: Owner tries to kick me out because of guide dog, everyone and their mom yells at him about it and he runs away.


Very recently, I finished secondary education and started my superior studies. Less than 20 meters away from my school is a little express supermarket type place, really handy for us students who need a snack or a drink since we spend a lot of time at the school. It's a small place with a lot of stuff, so I always go in with a friend and ask them to get my stuff for me, since I can't see anyway and they usually have one guy sitting behind the counter and nothing more. I still go into the store itself, though, so that my friends and I can browse through stuff if we're not sure what to get.
The third or fourth day, we come in, and as we start looking at some snacks, the employee comes up to us. The dialog went something like this (I am REALLY not being racist, this is as close as I can reproduce it):
Employee: Excuse me. No dogs. Dog out.
Me: Oh, don't worry, he's my guide dog. He has his harness on, so he'll just stand next to me.
E: No. Dog cannot. Please.
Friend: The law says you have to let him.
E: Please! No dog, dog out.
At this point I remember that there's a police station in front of my school.
M: OK. We will be riiight back.
We leave and walk up to the policeman on duty next to the station.
M: Excuse me, sir, we're having a problem at the (storename). They are not letting me in with my guide dog.
Policeman: Seriously? Give me a minute.
He walks into the store and comes back not 20 seconds later, saying we can go in.
Since that moment, they have not complained about the dog. What I have noticed, though, is that this particular employee not only tries his best not to talk to me, but also makes a point of putting his hand as far away as humanly possible from mine when I pay, so I usually have to let go of the mcoin and hope his hand is there. I also have to hold my hand palm up so that he can drop my change onto it from above. God forbid he touch the blind guy, might be contagious.

TL;DR: Express supermarket employee ignores my explanations, I bring the police to him and it takes less than 20 seconds to back down, now he is deliberately rude to me.

I am so sorry if this post is too long or does not exactly fit the sub. If you've read this far, thank you!
I may post more of these that I've heard from the other guide dog users I know if anyone is interested.

At a large bulk store this afternoon (we’ll call it “Ham’s club”), and my MIL and I were looking for clothes for my kids. We couldn’t find something we wanted in the right size, and asked one of the employees if there was anywhere else it could be.

She said “There’s another table up by the entrance, but if it’s not there, we don’t have it, I’m sorry.”

To which I replied “I already checked there, thank you. And it’s not like you’re purposefully hiding it from me.”

We get to the front, and our cashier starts talking to a fellow employee as she’s scanning my items. She tells me that my total is somewhere around $75. I go to insert my card and did some quick math: switch game is $60, plus the $25 Harry Potter item, the 2 Pokémon sets and a Pokémon stuffed animal should be well over $100!! I asked her if she scanned the game and she looked incredibly confused and said, “What game?” I pulled it out of the bag and showed her, she reviews the list of items on the screen and discovers that she didn’t.

At the end of it, we were hungry and went looking for a restaurant to eat in. The one we wanted was full so we went to the one down the street. That turned out to be a terrible idea.

&amp;#x200B;

It started when my SO and I were sitting at the bar getting a drink. Some complete stranger sits down next to me, drunk, and starts yelling (literally) at us about the ""damn liberals"" and their smoking ban. I turn to him and tell him I don't care talk to someone else about it. He doesn't. We grabbed our beer and moved to the opposite side of the bar. Do you think that's where it ended?  Nope... We got a table and we're eating our food and he tried a few more times to initiate a conversation before being told to get lost. Fast forward to me needing to use the bathroom, he followed me in there and tried, again... I ignored him, without saying a word, and walked out. Now, I am on my 3rd beer and we are in the game room having a fun conversation amongst ourselves when he comes over again and says ""Hey FloatyMcBoatface!""

My buddy, (Army SF) and I (Marine Recon) stand up instantly and ask him why the fuck he took the picture and why he's been bugging us all night long. When I tell him to delete the photo, he starts taking video, and then starts pushing us back, telling us to leave him alone...  hahaha, oh you poor soul.  We were, now it's too late. Up to this point none of us had touched him or given him any thought other than a few leave us alone's. So what do you think he did?  Of course he started really trying to fight us. Well that ended very poorly for him, then his 2 friends tried to jump in, that also went poorly for them.

The absolute best part though, they filmed every single interaction throughout the entire evening on their phones. Guess who's in jail...  It isn't us. The police thought that was quite funny.

Well, there was a sign that said additional 50% off clearance. I found a cute pair of pink shoes for my daughter. So I picked them up and went to the check out. 

The cashier was super nice. He saw I was wearing a fandom shirt and commented on it. We chatted for a while. The shoes were not apart of the sale. I was bummed but didn’t make a big deal about it. Well he decided to give me the discount! I thanked him greatly.

Sometimes being a nice person pays off. I’m happy and my little girl is gonna be thrilled with her pink shoes!

A little background:
I'm a 18 yr old mexican female (about to turn 19 soon) and work retail at a mall. I know the mall like the back of my hand and whenever I'm waiting for a ride to go home, I take a look around and see what items I need and don't need

This incident happened just yesterday and I'm still fuming. Usually when I come into work, I like to wear makeup and dress up sometimes but on this day I decided not to. I was wearing a hoodie, no makeup, glasses, my hair up, and I was carrying my backpack(it's sorta important later). I was waiting for my ride and decided to take a look around. I went into this department store at the mall (it rhymes with jaceys). I usually go in there to look at makeup and whatnot. I walked into one of the small makeup kiosks there and looked around for a bit. Once I walked in, I was bombarded by two of the employees there but they seemed nice and didn't cause me any trouble. 

Something caught my eye doe awhile looking. It was a cleansing balm that removes makeup and I heard such great reviews about it, I decided to grab it. I was holding it and kept looking around. Then this 3rd employee( white female) walked in and asked me if I was okay, I said yes, I'm fine thank you. She kept looking at the item I had in my hand and not once did she look at me awhile we were talking. She asked if someone else was helping me with that. I said no. She asked if I wanted her to put it up where the registers are and I said no, but thank you. I thought of it as weird but didn't pay too much mind. Boi was I wrong! Wherever I went, she went. I felt creeped out, uncomfortable and violated in a way. She acted like I was gonna steal it or something. I don't steal cuz that's against my moral code. If I can't afford it, I put it back where it was and go somewhere else.

I decided not to buy it even tho I wanted it. So I put it back, said thank you, and left. I was fuming awhile walking our. I don't know why this particular situation bothered me so much cuz I delt with so much discrimination my whole life before and I was used to it. But this just rubbed me the wrong way.

I told my parents and my friends about this. They said I should've gave her a piece of my mind and I should've but I was so upset at that moment, I couldn't think straight.

Anyways, honestly I don't know if this story was right for this subreddit, but if you took the time out of your day to read this, thank you!

My infant son was diagnosed with a breathing disorder today. We believe it is just acute but time will tell. He was administered an albuterol treatment via nebulizer at his doctor’s office before we left and we were told to give him additional treatments every four hours. 

Our “preferred” pharmacy, due to insurance, is the Three Letter pharmacy nearby. They recently absorbed another Three Letter nearby. Our doctor warned us that she had issues sending scripts to this pharmacy recently so to be on the lookout. 

I waited on hold for thirty minutes with no one answering before I gave up and headed over. My son NEEDS these treatments to be able to breathe; we were instructed that if they aren’t successful he would need a trip to the ER. 

They have no record of anything being sent in. At all. No “it will be ready in half an hour,” just a “we don’t have it at all. Your doctor didn’t send it in.” Except I know she did. I saw her do it on her laptop. There were about ten people waiting for prescriptions to be filled, a constant voice saying FOUR PHARMACY CALLS ON HOLD, six cars in the drive through and I had to wait behind four people just to be told I was SoL. 

I had to call the on call doctor at the office and have him re-issue it. This time to Evergreen. I called them about ten minutes later to check in and they told me it would be ready in less than an hour. 

It was ready on time. Everyone was friendly and not acting like they were in a sweatshop. 

My prescription insurance strongly recommends Three Letter, and I’m sure many do, leading to the backup. I get it. I am sad for the employees. I also know I will never use them again.

This is usually every 4-6 weeks. One of my medications was being slowly upped over the year and had stabilized at 1000mgs for a couple of months.  In December I went for my usual assessment, and got my usual prescription, which I held onto because I still had about a week left of my last prescription and because I didn't have time from work to go to my regular pharmacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've been using this same pharmacy for over 2 years when I first went to my doctor with my current issues.  So they know me quite well as I'm there every month at least.

&amp;#x200B;

I went in on Christmas Eve pick up my prescription and that's when the trouble started.  My pharmacist (let's call him Dave), bless his attention to detail, noticed that my 1000mgs prescription was written down as 400mgs.  Dave took me into the consultation room and I explained my last assessment and that my doctors hadn't mentioned any changes to my meds.  He had the name of my head doctor and I gave him the name of that doctors registrar and so Dave spent about half an hour calling around trying to find one of my doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

I have anxiety and this whole thing was causing me to shake and get dizzy but the pharmacy staff kept bringing me water, and let me stay in the consultation room and generally just made sure I was ok. This was Christmas Eve after all and I wasn't sure they could find my doctors and was extremely worried I wouldn't be able to get my meds.

&amp;#x200B;

But Dave persisted, and he finally got a hold of the registrar and cleared things up, and the registrar also called me to make sure I was ok. She confirmed the prescription should have been 1000mgs and so Dave prepared my meds and I was on my way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am incredibly grateful for Dave and the staff at my pharmacy.  I really wouldn't go anywhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Lesson learned: check the prescription before leaving the doctors!

 I have rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes severe chronic pain. I take a narcotic painkiller as part of pain management, but yesterday, my doctor decided to increase the dose. My pharmacy did not stock the medication in this dose, and neither did any other local pharmacies, so my doctor called around, and found this boutique-like compound pharmacy in an upscale neighborhood that had it. He called the pharmacist, explained the situation, and sent me over there. 

The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted with hostility. The pharmacist angrily asked what I was doing there because he had not seen me before, and when I told him that my doctor had called him, he said he did not remember. When I showed him my prescription, he rolled his eyes and said “Oh you like narcotics. Give me your ID and insurance card.” This irritated me, but I complied. When he pulled up my patient profile, he ran a background check and asked why I was trying to fill this prescription when I had gotten one two weeks ago. I explained that I had been given that medication, and my doctor was giving me another prescription to increase the dose. His response?
“Well I’ll see to it that you won’t see this prescription until you bring the old one back. You’re probably selling these pills to your little friends.”
I was frustrated, but I told him that was no problem, and that I’d have to go back home to get the old prescription and that I would return in a day or two. As I was walking out, I heard him mutter “She probably has to get those pills back from her fucking crackhead friends.”
This was a day ago, but I’m still very hurt and angry. I never fill CII prescriptions early, never abuse them, and I was nothing but polite to that man. I know we’re in the middle of an opioid epidemic, but it’s a shame that legit patients get this treatment. He owns the pharmacy, so I have no way of reporting him.

Great atmosphere, the food was good and the server was friendly. There were six of us and five of us ordered the same chicken dish.

I was the first to notice my chicken was undercooked/raw. We all had the leg part and the joint between drumstick and thigh was pink. I pointed out mine to my friend and she found that hers was undercooked as well. One other colleague also said that his was the same. So we told the waiter and he called for his manager.

The manager then in a defensive tone told us that our chicken was cooked in the same batch as the diners before us but no one complained. I pointed out my pink chicken to her and she said that was how chicken is supposed to look like.

""There's no blood, right? So it's not undercooked.""

One colleague (not the manager) asked if we wanted to replace our meal and we said no because we were full. So that colleague said we should get our meals comped. The manager said she will comp one meal (mine) but she made a face at us as if we were cheapos trying to get a free meal. Tbh, I'd probably let it go if she'd apologised and offered a replacement (which I'd refuse) or discount or whatever but the defensive attitude really annoyed me.

Note: I was a fellow customer in this scenario. This happened maybe 2 weeks ago. It requires a chunk of backstory and I apologize. Skip to ""and then it happened"" if you don't wanna go through the upcoming block.

My family has some stock in a resort that we can use whenever, basically, and so for my oldest brother's birthday my mom decided to fly him out to us and then spend her spring break week there with him, me, and my two nieces.

We stayed there for 4 days. The first full day we had on-property, it rained, and was a little chilly. Atypical weather for my state even at just this time of year, but in any case for people acclimated to much warmer weather, it was not a pool kind of day.

To make a long story short, by the end of the day we had 10 free cards with 100 points (game credits) each for the arcade, probably to make up for the weather, and we decided to use them all that day and then, at the end of the trip, take my nieces to get them some prizes. At the aforementioned end of the trip, I alone took them back for prizes because my mom and brother went to breakfast.

**And then it happened.**

We're at the counter with the very helpful and polite guy working with my nieces to ensure their choices, when, enter stage right, Karen and her husband. They have cards much like my nieces and I do, and I assume they're planning on redeeming their points like the girls were.

These cards are pretty much the same cards you get when you *purchase* credits, and they had, I guess you could say one fatal flaw-- you couldn't stack them. Most of the games in the arcade were 50-75 points, with some games strewn about that needed 100+ and *one* game of pinball that used 25 points. But if you used two of these 100 point freebie cards on some 75 point games, you couldn't swipe both on a 50 point game. All that was left was pinball.

For us, this hadn't been a problem. My brother was good at pinball, so the day we played all the games, he finished off with several rounds of pinball so we didn't have any points left on the cards.

But for Karen this might have well been the end of the goddamn world.

When she first comes up, she asks the employee if she can speak to him for a moment. Since my niece is being very decisive, I nod for him to go ahead and handle her while I work with the girls, not paying the utmost attention I admit, but she grabs my focus quickly.

E= Employee, K= Karen, Me= Jim fuckin' Kirk, who do you *think?*

E: Hi, how can I help you?

K: We got these cards for free the other day and we used 75 points on each of them. That machine over there isn't letting us swipe them both to use 50 points.

E: Unfortunately our games aren't able to do that.

K: ...I see. *(with that sort of ""that's not gonna work for me, sweetie"" tone)* Well, can you combine the points on them both up here?

E: Sorry, no, all I can really do is cash in points up here.

K: So what am I supposed to do?

Me: *(muttering something about pinball, but she either doesn't notice or thinks I'm talking to the girls. or perhaps I was too quiet.)*

E: You can always add more points with the machine there *(meaning, on her own dime)*, or there's pinball in the corner.

K: *(sideways glance at the machine)* But we got these for free.

Oh, hold up, bitch, you are *so* not about to play this game, right? Be a bad example for your own damn kids all you want, but *do not* fuck up around my nieces.

E: I'm really sorry, but there's nothing I can really do for you.

*And then we hear the true Call of the Karen*

K: Can you get me your manager?

Me: *[internally] Oh sugar honey iced tea she went there* ~~as a note, I don't even *mentally* curse around my nieces, to avoid ever potentially saying anything out loud, so I quite literally thought that~~

As the nice employee radios for a manager, my very thin filter snaps, just a bit.

Me: So, you got something for free and decided to complain about it anyways, *just because* you can't use it the way you think you deserve?

K: Exactly!

Y'all. I could've smacked her just for even *considering* I agreed with her. Instead, I did what any good southern girl would do. Shut my mouth and finally looked over at her to give her the most condescending ""bless your heart"" expression I think she's ever seen. She, at least, has the common decency to realize I'm *not* being sympathetic and shuts her mouth. Employee and I shared a look, he nods to me and I just shrug.

When the manager gets there, the employee comes back to work with my nieces (who, for being young, were very patient and I was very proud). As a side note, something he did that I don't think he was supposed to was worked with the girls to get the most out of their points-- when the eldest pointed to a small packet of Smarties for 5 points, he leaned in like he was telling her a secret and said he had little rolls of Smarties that only cost one point each and came with more in a pack and helped her score some. These rolls weren't being kept with the other prizes and he had to enter them manually. I apologized to him a bit after she and the manager were gone for having to put up with Karen in the first place. He shrugged it off.

I don't know the exact words exchanged between the manager and our villain of the story, since the employee had come back to working with my nieces and I was paying them more attention. Her husband never once paid any mind to anything going on. I do know Karen left before we did, and she hung around at a table just outside the arcade seemingly continuing to complain while we sat out in the sun at another table eating candy and waiting on my mom &amp; brother. At one point she even looked over and seemed to see me/stare at me once, I just turned my attention back to my youngest niece like she wasn't there.

Added bonus points: Older niece asked me why Karen had been so rude. Faith in humanity a little skewered, faith in nieces rock solid.

TL;DR: Went on vacation. Still had to deal with Karen at an arcade. When life gave her ice cream, she threw it back in everyone's face and called it a lemon.",1,Free. FREE. This is a joke.,13

Being at 5:30, the theater wasn't terribly full, but it also wasn't empty.

This family of five, if my memory serves me, sits down about three rows in front of us on the ""ground level"" (not front row of theater, but front row of the seats that started going up with stairs, etc.).  They brought a little boy who I would have guessed to be about three?

I have no problem with people bringing their children to movies (as long as they're appropriate - please don't bring a toddler to The Purge, you know), but I expect people to pay attention to their child.  After all, when a kid is antsy or crying or what have you, it affects EVERYONE in the theater.  So you can probably see where this is going.

Throughout the movie, the toddler is running up and down the stairs.  At first, the dad (I'm assuming) chased after him, but I guess he got sick of tending to his child because then he remained firmly in his seat.  His mother (again, an assumption) stayed in her seat, but would turn around to watch as her child ran up and down the far aisle and disturbing everyone else. He made a lot of noise and distractions.

As we were leaving the theater, someone who had been sitting behind us had approached the family and told them that they should be taking their child out into the hall to run off some steam because he had distracted pretty much everyone in the theater.  The mother snapped at the other woman that they had paid money for their tickets and they could do what they wanted.

So had everyone else in that theater and they all deserved having a distraction free outing, the defending woman replied (paraphrased because my memory isn't that good).  It started to escalate but we were leaving and not really wanting to watch the drama that was about to unfold.

When I was younger, I was pretty hesitant to go ask a worker where to find items. I don't know exactly why. I think it had something to do with disturbing a worker from their tasks.

Any case, I'm still hesitant, but a bit better about it.

To the anecdote I'd like to share.

I went to a store that is a part of a large chain in the U.S., and it was at about 10:30 pm, so about an hour and a half ago. I was looking for individual food coloring packages, and there were only four packs with different colors in them in the cake decoration aisle. As it was late, I did not really want to approach anyone, but I was lost.

I asked a guy restocking in one of the aisles if they carried individual colors, and he was very friendly and not disturbed in the slightest. I don't know what it was about the interaction, but he had a very genuine and pleasant looking countenance.

It was overall a very good experience, and though I can't say I've had a bad one before, I always feel uncomfortable asking retail workers for help. With this experience, I didn't feel ill at ease at all, besides the initial courage I had to work up to approach him.

I thought it was a nice thing to share. I hope you all enjoyed it too.

On Sunday, I got a text saying that it was out for delivery, and soon after, that I was the next stop. I was not at the house, but my daughter was there with the kids, so I let her know that it was going to show up in the next few minutes (based on the driver's location).

I watched the dot that represented the truck until it was touching the dot that represented the house, and then shut the tracking window. A few minutes later, I got a notification that it had been delivered, and texted my daughter to see if she had it. 

She did not.

Rainforest sent me a photo of the parcel sitting on a chair that is not ours, on a porch that is not ours.

My daughter threw her kids into the double stroller (the joys of two under two) and raced around the block looking for a porch with chairs like the one in the photo, but never found the house the package was left at.

She posted on the Community Spacebook Page, asking if anyone recognzed the chair or porch, or had gotten her parcel, but got no useful response.

Since the message with the photo asked me what I thought of it, I replied that it was neither our chair nor our porch. I waited for a response, but got nothing.

I called Customer Support. They pulled up some sort of tracking data that suggested the carrier had delivered to a home on the opposite side of the street, but as they are rowhomes, it was not possible to say which house it was.

They said the carrier would come back out, find it and deliver it.

So naturally I sent the card back in for repairs, a month later I got my card back only to find that it still didn't work. So I sent it back 4 more times over the course of three years until February when I decided I was done with it and I demanded a replacement. I sent the card back on February 20th, and as of today I have still not received the replacement. 

The one upside of the entire situation is that they decided to grant me a model upgrade (GTX 1080TI ) because of all of the trouble I have had to go through. I consented in writing to receive the model upgrade. I thought that was great, and I was so excited yesterday to see that my graphics card had been shipped out. But when I looked at the shipping manifest, they tried to send me a lower quality graphics card (GTX 970) than the one I had bought from them originally, even though I had verbally agreed to a higher quality model. So I called them and got the problem fixed only for them to do the exact same thing today. This happened twice in spite of the fact that I have called their customer service every other day since I sent the card in to make absolutely sure that they do not mess it up again and some how they still manage to do it wrong. 

TLDR -  Sent a graphics card in 5 times to be repaired, it never got fixed so I tried to get a replacement, ended up getting a model upgrade but they are dragging their feet and or handling the replacement with impressive ineptitude. 

Also, while GTX does denote an Nvidia card, Nvidia is not the company.

But they are repairable. I know because I’ve done this before. So I headed over to my usual cheap glasses chain (  2 pairs for about a hundred bucks) in search of my usual technician who has saved my glasses multiple times. This particular woman is pure gold at twisting then back in shape. 

But my usual woman isnt at the store when I get there. No worries I figure the technicians are all trained and can probably help me. So I show the glasses to the guy at the main desk to see if he can help. He takes the glasses and starts trying to bed the arm back in place. I give a little yelp and say wait dude shouldn’t you heat them first?? He was like “huh?” So I take the glasses back because clearly he will end up breaking them and I ask if I could see the technician. He said I am the technician! And then says he will show them to the optometrist. He heads off and comes back like 2 seconds later and says these glasses are unfixable and you will need to buy new frames. He clearly didn’t show them to anyone. He went through a door and came back out. He just wants to sell me new glasses. So I just say ok thanks and leave the store. 

Next I head to a little independent shop that repairs glasses and ask if my frames are fixable and if so what would the cost be. The guy there said oh yeah these can be repaired but the cost will be $60. I said ok well they are cheap frames and that’s about what they cost me new so I thanked him and left. 

I decided to give it one more shot and head to a big chain store in the same strip mall. I show the lady at the desk my frames and asked if they could fix them. She said maybe but in doing so they might break the frames. I said give it a shot. So she took them back to the optometrist to give it a try. 5 minutes later she walks back smiling and hands me my repaired glasses. Wow!! I asked the cost and pulled out my wallet. She said no charge! Have a great day!

Now, for some backstory, I had $20 in cash.  Normally I don't eat out much but my family was in town, they wanted to go to lunch and I'm lucky if I see them once a year.  So I splurged even though that was pretty much the only money I had til payday.  I know from experience lunch at this place costs about $12 or cheaper depending on what I get, so I figured I had enough for lunch and a generous tip.  This is important I promise.

So my grandma orders the Philly cheese steak, which came with a house salad.  She ate the salad and half of the sandwich, which for her is a ton of food.  Seriously she doesn't eat enough to keep a mouse alive.  She complained the entire time we were there, the salad dressing tasted weird, the Philly was terrible, we waited too long for the food, it was cold.  Yeah it was a good time.  

So when the waitress came with the check my grandma made sure to tell her all of these complaints, never mind she never brought it up the other times the waitress was there.  The poor waitress offered to get her something else, comp the food, apologized, nope my grandma was not happy with any of those options.  She just wanted to make sure the waitress made sure the kitchen knew how terrible the food was. 

 Of course the food was comped, but what makes me angry is she ate a butt ton of food (for her) and then raised a fuss about how terrible it was.  I know this is a common occurrence when you work retail, I've worked it, but to watch a family member do it was infuriating.  She took what was supposed to be a nice lunch and turned it into a miserable time.  And to top it off, she didn't tip for her meal.  My lunch was $11, so I just left the $20 on the table.  

To my way of thinking, that's not enough tip for two lunches for how my grandma acted and treated that waitress.  I was embarrassed and I wished I had more money to give.  AND SHE RUINED MY TIME WITH MY FAMILY.  To all the waiters/waitresses out there, I'm really sorry for these kind of people, I wish they didn't exist.

So explain to this guy that the best way to fill a cone without getting it all over the place and making a huge mess is to do it kind of the dairy Queen style with an up-and-down motion.

If it's as simple as that, do the drivers not care at all whether you leave a tip on the app? Or is it more complicated?

If from now on I add 0 tip to the order and instead tip a few bucks in cash, would it be an overall benefit to the drivers? Or would leaving no virtual tip over and over somehow drag the drivers base pay down in the long run?

I order from Boar Bash several times a week (I know I know, I'm lazy and have poor money management skills) and sometimes run into small or big issues but I'd never straight-up not gotten my food even if it was super late or messed up.

Cut to today, I'm waiting on an order and get the notification that they're close by. I live in an apartment so I usually watch their location so I can call them if they seem to be going to the wrong building. I open the app and immediately see that the order has been completed already, but it still allows me to click the call button so I call to tell the driver where my building is. No answer. I wait 5 min, call again (can't click the call button anymore but their number was in my recent calls) and still no answer. 

At this point I pretty much assumed that I finally had made enough orders to get a driver who wanted to steal my food. Wait another 10 min before clicking the ""food never arrived"" button, and 30 seconds later my doorbell rings.

I never had anyone ""complete"" the order before giving me my food, did she just want it to look like it was delivered a few min earlier than it was? I didn't think they could even still see your address after the order was closed out.

Now I'm guessing Boar Bash is going to call me soon to ask about not getting my food, and the driver will probably be pissed about being falsely reported since there's no way for me to manually un-do the report.

Today I went to a royal burger fast food place with my friends. We’re college students only part time jobs so we qualify for our local EBT/food benefits program.

On their website, it lists fast food places that accept the EBT card. We didn’t feel like cooking, so we decided to go to one of those restaurants. On the front window, it said “EBT Access” with a huge check mark on a flier. We were in the clear.

We got up to the register and ordered our food, but when we go to pay with our card, the cashier said they didn’t accept EBT, so we paid with cash. We left in a state of confusion as to why they said that, especially with two sources (including the restaurant itself) saying otherwise. I asked her why it lists their website as an acceptor of EBT and why they have a sign, and she had no answer for me.

It left my friends and me feeling a little down. We didn’t want to spend the money to eat out, but wanted to treat ourselves a little bit to the fast food we don’t get that often at all.

When I do order food I usually specify in the comments section that I'm a truck driver and that they need to deliver to my semi truck. 

One day I was making a delivery at a distribution center and decided to order some Chinese food from a food delivery app (let's call them Floor Trash). In the comments section I write: ""please call when you arrive, I'm in a semi truck."" I add the ""please call"" part so that I can direct them to me when they get here since it's a big place.

After about 30 minutes I get a notification saying that they're almost here, I open up the app and watch them drive around in circles trying to find the place. I attempt to call them but when I do it goes to voicemail.

Fast forward another 30 minutes of me watching them drive around in circles. (This place isn't hard to find, I have no idea what they're doing"". 

Finally I get a notification saying that my food has been delivered.....Except now I'm pissed because they never delivered it or called me. 

So I'm thinking that they must have delivered it to the front office or something. So I walk about 15 minutes to the office. Nope, not here. I ask the clerk if someone came in looking for me. He said that a delivery guy came inside looking for someone but he didn't know where they went.

I spent about an hour walking around looking for my food. I finally just give up and walk back to my truck. I open up my Floor Trash app and attempt to report my order as ""Never Delivered"" ....BUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT THE APP CRASHES. I tried to do this about 30 times. I tried restarting my phone, updating the app, nothing! So all I could do was send Floor Trash an email.

I write: ""Hello, I ordered $80 worth of food and never got it. Please give me a refund.""

5 days later they respond: ""Hello Floor Trash user! We're sorry you had a bad experience, we have added a $30 credit to your account. Have a nice day!""

My response: ""NO, $30 in credit is worthless to me because I refuse to use your crappy service ever again, i want my $80 refunded to my bank account""

Also I forgot to mention that I have used them a few times before this and every time I have I always get an incorrect order, this was just the icing on the sh*t cake. 

I uninstalled their app and will never order again, their drivers are absolutely terrible.

Edit: I did in fact get a full refund after a couple more emails of them raising their credit offer. Took about 3 weeks in total to get a refund.

Edit 2: For those concerned about the fact that $80 was spent on Chinese food, I would like to mention that I was ordering for myself and my husband. Floor Trash also charges an arm and a leg to deliver.

191,DanniBlacke,0,t3_b7i732,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b7i732/the_burger_omen/,"This story happened about a week ago while I was visiting my local burger monarchy. This was probably one of the strangest, most frustrating times I have experienced in a fast food joint. A lot of little things that I normally don’t mind just kept adding up. So here’s my story/rant

Picture this, I just get over a stomach bug, Im pale and I look like death. The only way I can describe me as a whole is a college student right after finals. It was not pretty. 

Anywho, I finally feel well enough to eat, and I want something salty and fried and all around bad for me. The kingdom of burgers is where I decide on. Right as I’m walking in, I see a women sort of flailing her arms. I can hear her shouting through my loud music. I pause my music because I’m nosey, and listen in. 

She’s going on about fries and how they can’t put her fries in with the rest of them? She’s pointing and shouting and honestly it’s the weirdest thing. She says the burger clown next door has no problem doing what she wants. I eventually realize she doesn’t want salt on her fries, wants it fresh, and doesn’t want it even remotely close to the metal bin where they dump the fries since it has remnants of salt. She shouts more about how burger clown is better, her husband is important?( seriously, I don’t know what it had to with anything, she just had to shout it at these poor ladies). Maybe she doesn’t want salt since she has too much in her personality , who knows. 

This *should* have been a wake up call to me to get the fuck out of there, but I walked in halfway through this conversation when she was already worked up, I just thought she hadn’t ordered yet and was being difficult with the cashier. 

**Oh how wrong I was**

I decide before ordering I’ll just try and make it painless and easy and be nice to her(as nice and my dead looking self can muster) I order an item that’s not new but it’s been promoted on tv a few times, and ask for the crispy chicken version instead of the beef. This immediately flusters the girl as she has to ask if it’s still in the menu, they say it is. So again, I ask for the crispy chicken version instead of the beef. She doesn’t quite understand however, and just adds a regular chicken sandwich. I caught it when she was re-reading my order. I explain that I want the beef one, but instead of beef it comes in chicken (it’s not like I’m asking for something new, it’s advertised as either chicken or beef). So she adds it to my order, except she didn’t take off the chicken sandwich from earlier, I told her to get rid of the first crispy chicken and keep the other one, which she does not understand at all. I mean, she keeps asking me and telling me I want only chicken sandwich and not specialty chicken sandwich. I seriously went back and forth with this girl 5 times. Maybe more. 

I’m nice, and I’m calm, I probably look like a stoner that isn’t stoned. To be honest, if wasn’t feeling half dead I probably would have gotten a lot more frustrated and irritated with her. But I simply didn’t have it in me. She also seemed new so I wasn’t going to be hard on her for not knowing. 

We had to get a manager to do it, and she whipped up the correct order within a few seconds which was a sandwich, drink, onion rings, and an ice cream pie because why not. Cashier asks if order is correct after I pay, in a hurry to get out of there I just say yes. She changed some things without me realizing. 

A few other things that are slightly off while I wait are=

•she says “fries” while staring at me and sets a bag down on the counter not one minute later from when I ordered. I didn’t think she meant me, maybe she just was looking since I didn’t order fries

•there’s no ice in the machine, not a problem, I don’t feel like talking anymore and asking them to get more  so I just grab my soda and wait 

•it wasn’t a super busy night, only the saltless fry lady was in front of me but my order took a lot longer than expected maybe 10 minutes

•In my hurry, I didn’t realize she didn’t add my onion rings to my corrected chicken sandwich, it was just fries. I’m like “ok that ones on me since I didn’t look good enough on the receipt”, so I order some onion rings to go

When I got my order, I was so ready to leave, until I saw a long brown hair hanging half way in the bag. It was resting on the fries. So, yeah I was grossed out since I have short black hair. 

Part of me wants to just leave, I want this to be over with but I know I’ll just have wasted money since I would be too grossed out even touch my food. 

I tell them and show them the hair, and they start to remake it, a part me is now wondering if they had also messed up the order from saltless lady. Maybe she could not have salt and they didn’t quite get that. I’m thinking about the lovely salty and oily taste that’s soon to come, when my order finally arrives. I’ve got a bag with my meal, a little bag with the onion rings, but no pie. 

I ask the manager since she handed me my food, and she looks around. 

Lo and behold, the “fries” the cashier set down earlier was actually my ice cream pie, which had been sitting on the counter from even before I got my first hair filled bag of food. It took about 25 minutes for me to get out of there with my food, so the ice cream pie was already melted. I’m too tired and too dead to be frustrated so I leave, I just want my food and to eat it too. 

Oh, and the cherry on top? My fries didn’t have any salt on them.

I went to pay for a full tank of petrol at the local petrol station. The total was something around sixty quid, so I told the teller I'd be paying by debit card. She motioned for the card, I gave it to her and she swiped it through the terminal. She then waited for the transaction to go through, looking bored. Suddenly, she took the slip of paper which got printed out by the terminal, slammed it on the counter in front of me along with my card and told me the payment was rejected.

Now, this had never happened to me before, so I was confused. ""What does that mean?"" I asked her.

She pointed at the paper, which had something like ""payment rejected"" printed on it and replied in a condescending tone, ""Your card was rejected.""

""Yes, but what does that mean?"" I asked again.

""It means there's probably no money on the card or something,"" she shrugged.

I knew this was bollocks, since I had all the money for uni on that card (which was a lot more than sixty quid). I asked her, ""Well, could you maybe run it through again? I know there's money on the card.""

She refused. ""No, I can't. It got rejected.""

I was still confused but decided it wasn't worth the aggro, so I picked up my card, opened my wallet and pulled out two fifty pound notes (I always carry around hundred pounds of cash for emergencies). As soon as the teller saw the money, she quickly backtracked. ""Give me that card again,"" she demanded.

I gave it to her, not even sure what was going on anymore. She swiped it and the transaction went through without a hitch. I said something along the words of, ""You could've just done that when I asked,"" to which she replied with a snarky, ""You don't have to be so rude.""

I told her I wasn't the one being rude and quickly left.

Till this day, though I cannot prove it, I am convinced she somehow did it on purpose. She saw a uni student, decided it would be a good idea to make them sweat by rejecting their card and then, I don't know, calling the police when they couldn't afford the petrol? Why else would she do a complete one-eighty when she saw the cash?

I don't know, maybe I am reading too much into it and she was just tired and annoyed after a long day at work...

Edit:  

After reading all the replies, I have come to the conclusion that she probably didn't do it on purpose after all, but she did enjoy making the situation worse by being rude and unhelpful. Still horrible customer service but probably not willful.

I needed to call a local clinic to see if they would be able to do pre-op blood work and tests before I had surgery a few weeks later. All I needed to know was if they could run the blood work and when they could set up an appointment for me (or if I could just walk in and wait). So I call them and a receptionist answers. I tell her what I need. But instead of just giving me a simple response, she starts prodding me for information = ""Why are you getting surgery?"" ""What type of surgery are you having?"" ""Do you have a note from your doctor?"" etc etc. things that I shouldn't have to tell a random stranger over the phone. I just wanted answers though so I obliged. I never got an answer on whether I would be able to have my blood work done and what time of the week I should show up. The receptionist instead told me she would have to ""talk to her supervisor"" and would call back in about an hour. She hung up, and several hours passed.

I was off from work that day, so I was waiting around until my mom got home from her job. I explained to her what happened and that I still hadn't been called back so she offered to call on my behalf. My mom calls, says that her daughter needs blood work done for an upcoming surgery. She asks if that can be done at the clinic and what times are available/what time the clinic opens. She immediately gets an answer (like how hard is that?) and hangs up. 

I get that I have a very child-like voice. But I try my hardest to sound professional and put together over the phone. Even if I was an actual child, who would be prank calling a clinic to ask about blood work (since I'm assuming the receptionist thought I was pulling some kind of joke?)

196,KindlyOffer,0,t3_b79ir2,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b79ir2/worst_salon_exsperence/,"This was several years ago, but still sticks out as one of my worst experiences with a business. 

So I was young, maybe around fifteen or sixteen, and I go into a small hair salon. They had a deal in the window, 'wash cut and blow-dry £25' which was pretty cheap. So I go in, and book an appointment. I'm told I had to wait an hour, so I walk around outside for a while, but since the street it was on had absolutely no other retail stores or anything remotely interesting, I came back to wait it out in the salon. 

This salon also had a nail station, so imagine how badly it smelled in there.

After waiting an hour, with that smell, I get called up, and I confirm with my hairdresser how much it will cost. £25, just like the poster. I tell her what I want, and off we go. About twenty minutes into the treatment a young woman and her family comes in, and she sits herself down in a dressers chair instead of the waiting sofa, waits for like five minutes, then loudly exclaims, ""I only need a trim and we don't have a lot of time, can you just do mine quickly.""

I hoped the hairdresser would tell her to wait, but no. She looks at me and asked me if it would be alright if she cut the woman's hair real quick. New me would have told the woman to bog off and wait her turn, old me was timid and a doormat, and told her to go ahead. 

So I sit there with damp hair for another fifteen minutes while this woman gets a 'trim'. The hairdresser takes her money, they walk out and she comes back to me. We finish. It looks nice. I hand her one £20 note and one £10 note. She takes the money and walks away. She then comes back and tells me that she'd have to charge me the full £30 because I asked for 'additional services.' Which was absolute bullshit. I knew it was bullshit, she knew it was bullshit, but again, I was timid as fuck, and WOULD have let her just take the money because I was legit terrified of confrontation. 

But she manages to trip herself up, and ask me if there's anything else I might 'want.'

I tell her, in an awkward joking manner, that I'd 'want' the extra £5. She awkwardly laughs with me, says some other bullshit I can't remember, and gives me my change. 

I walk out of there resolved that I'd never return, feeling all kinds of shitty that I could be taken advantage of so much in just the space of two hours. I wish now that I'd said something, but regrets are regrets for a reason. Probably the most I've ever been mistreated by a store.

I have been selling my hand dyed clothing on Etsy for 5 years. In that time I’ve learned that USPS can have some fuck ups and the best way to get an upset customer to yell at USPS instead of me when their package goes missing is to send them a picture of the receipt I received when I dropped off the package. 

It’s also better to have yes be your answer when a customer requests to see a drop off receipt. 

Story:
It was early one Saturday morning, shortly after the post office opened when I arrived. If I have to go on a weekend I always go early to avoid long lines. When I walked inside there were only three people in line and two people finishing up with the employees at the till. Yes, it’ll be a quick one.

I wait in line for no longer than 5 minutes before the woman waves me up. Since I know it’s odd to wait in line for prepaid packages I always state my case as I walk up. “It’s prepaid, but I would like a receipt” 

A typical response to this involves the employee saying okay, accepting my package and handing me my receipt. It usually takes no more than 2 minutes. This day was different... the woman rolled her eyes at me and said “you know you don’t have to wait in line right? You can just drop it off in that room over there” she points to the package drop off room. 

“Oh, have they started offering receipts over there?” I ask thinking maybe that would be a better option in the future.

“No”

“Well that’s why I’m here, like I said, I would like a receipt”

She looks at me like I’ve just asked her to hand over her first born. “Why?”

“In case my customer asks to see it, I like to have one just in case.”

“They’ll still get mad you know”

At this point I had spent more time speaking to this woman than I did waiting in line and was beginning to get pretty annoyed. 

“Oh I know” I said said with a bit of a laugh “I’ve been doing this for years. I’d just rather be able to tell the customer I have the drop of receipt if they ask to see it than say no and be accused of never dropping it off” 

She laughs at me like I just told her the earth was flat. She finally grabs my package and says to me “I’ve been selling on Etsy for 12 years and I know they get mad either way” 

As she hands me my receipt I simply say thank you and walk quickly out the door. I really didn’t want to be part of her Etsy dick measuring contest. 

TL;DR 
Woman at post office tells me I shouldn’t wait in line with a prepaid package and I don’t need a receipt for my purposes, even though giving me one would take maybe 2 minutes. Then proceeds to argue with me about how I deal with my Etsy customers and brags about how long she’s been doing Etsy, causing me to spend more time dealing with her than I did waiting in line.

199,Poison_Contrl,0,t3_b7pr8s,11,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b7pr8s/fast_food_employee_annoys_everyone_in_the_store/,"Hello!This is my first time posting here on reddit and this story happened recently to me so i decided why not.Please go easy on the criticism,thank you and enjoy my suffering ;-;

So this happened last week on Saturday.It was only me and my brother at home(my parents went out to one of the local pubs).At 7 pm my brother and i were hungry and i was too lazy to make supper so i decided to order some food from a local fast food shop,lets just call the place FFR.So i ordered some food from FFR and the person that took my call estimated that my food would take 10 minutes to cook and 5 minutes to deliver,15 minutes in total if you were too lazy to do the maths.After they hung up i sat by one of the widows in my house overlooking the road.After a few minutes i decided to go on my phone to pass time,after a while i noticed my order was taking a while so i decided to check what time it was on the clock.2 HOURS,**2 HOURS**.2 hours had past and nobody had showed up.I even checked outside to see if it was left on the doormat, but nope not there.I decided to call back FFR to check my order.The man who picked up was different and had no idea about my order even when i told him my location and phone number.I had to reorder my food and this man really irritated me because whenever i said the name of any item on the menu he would repeat it wrong(for example i would say cheese burger he would say chicken burger).Before i hung up i told the guy on the phone that i would go to the restaurant to pick up the food and he gave the same estimate of 15 but would try to make it quicker.I stayed at home for a few minutes( mainly checking on my brother because i hadnt seen him for the past 2 hours, but luckily he was playing games on his ipad) then i went down the road to pick up my food.When i reached FFR i walked inside and saw no one at the counter and because of this a HUGE i mean **HUGE** i decided to look behind the counter to see what was going on( there was an open door behind the counter where the employees worked) people where running around frantic most likely trying to make my order.After 10 minutes i got my food and went home.Luckily my brother didnt set the house aflame and had continued playing games on his ipad.My brother usually goes to sleep at 8:30 pm but because of the delay he ended up going to bed at 10,but at least we got a nice pizza and burgers out of the situation.
      The next day i talked to my friend who had an older sister who had a shift at FFR that faithful night and my friend told me what happened inside the shop.So the guy who picked up my call the first time decided to pull a prank on not just me but all the other employees by saying that i was going to go and pick up the food instead of me wanting it delivered.After they made the food a cashier that my friends sister knew very well waited at the counter with the food.After 30 minutes they decided to throw it away(very professional i know).After 2 hours everyone forgot about it until the guy who picked up the second time said that someone had ordered a delivery that never came and the guy from the first time admitted to what he did.All the workers quickly put together my order(even some cashiers where pulled into the back and quickly thought how to make chips or burgers so that was probably the reason nobody was at the counter until 5 minutes after i arrived).The FFR employee that picked up my call the first time  was fired because of what happened with me and another employee(friend told me he was 17 and working two jobs to help his mom,bless his soul) almost had a panic attack with the stress and another burnt their hand on hot grease because they were working so quickly.

I think this should be in r/PettyRevenge or r/ProRevenge but i found this subreddit and decided hey why not here?This took a while to write and this situation really made my blood boil and i needed someplace to write it down.To whoever answered my call the first time.Fuck you

200,simplykxte,0,t3_b7f4lm,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b7f4lm/hotel_from_hell/,"This past Friday my boyfriend came into town for an even that I had with my organization. We’re both college students so we were looking for a cheaper hotel. I fully understood that when I booked a room for $57 a night I wasn’t going to be receiving luxury. However, what we got was appalling. After we checked in, we had to drive around to the other side of the ‘hotel’ since the doors were outside. This was warning sign #1 to me but as we had already paid and it was late, I decided to ignore it. 

When we walked into the room, I was immediately hit with a string cigarette smell - we had not been told that we had a smoking room as opposed to a non-smoking room. I tried to flip the lights on but when I flipped the switch nothing happened. I attempted to find a lamp and when I finally had some light in the room, I was shocked. The bed was in disarray. There were not sheets on the bed, the comforter was on the couch. I was scared we had walked into the wrong room and that there would be someone else still occupying the room - thankfully there wasn’t. Check out times for this hotel is 11 am, check in is 4 pm. It was around 11 pm when we had checked in, as my boyfriend had a late flight. There was plenty of time for the room to have been cleaned and prepared for the next guest.

We decided that we could not stay at this hotel. We book a room at another, trusted, hotel and we gather our things and go to the front desk. While sitting there waiting for someone to be available, there is another man who comes up after receiving the wrong type of room, and having that room be disgusting as well, receive a refund, so clearly this hotel gives refunds. When we’re finally able to speak to someone, we’re told only managers can issue refunds and that they would not be there until 8:30 am the next morning. Tired and frustrated, I took the phone number and we left. I realize now I should have spoke to the man who had received the refund and ask who he talked to. 

I called the next morning only to be greeted by a very rude lady who informed me that the managers had taken the day off and to call back Monday. Not knowing what to do, I ended the call. I called back Sunday, just to make sure I was being given the correct information, and again was told Monday. When Monday finally arrives, I call up there and am put on hold and after 5 minutes, the receptionist hangs up on me. Annoyed, I call back and am told that the manager just stepped out and she’s not sure when she’ll be back but she can take a message and pass it on. So, I left a message and waited 3 hours and heard nothing. When I called again, I was put on hold and hung up on again. I called once more and a new person answered the phone. She told me that she had called the office and that there was no answer but she could transfer me and I could leave a message. 

On Tuesday, my boyfriend called. He was able to speak to an assistant manager, however the line kept disconnecting. I called and spoke to him and he told me that he had all of our information and would give it to the manager first thing in the morning and that he would call me personally. After my last class on Wednesday, around 2pm, I call up there as I have not heard anything. The ass. manager says their system and phones have been down all day so my refund probably would not happen until tomorrow. When I call Thursday, I finally speak to the manager. She says that she has had a lot of things to take care of and that it is in her list of things to do but it will be taken care of by the latest on Wednesday. 

To say i’m furious is an understatement. I have been dealing with this hotel for over a week and am honestly so annoyed. I feel as if they are hoping that if they put me off enough I will give up. I’m not sure what else to do at this point. I’m 18, I don’t have a lot of leverage in this situation and my parents live 300+ miles away.  ",1,Hotel from Hell,22

Well I had been shopping for a new truck for about 2 weeks after the wreck with the help of my dad.  I had been driving an 05 Dakota and I like Dodge very much despite my family being a Ford family.  I had decided on the truck I wanted when my Dad went down to our usual dealership who sold new and used vehicles.  

We had been in the store probably 3 times looking and stuff when we found a nice 2018 Ram 1500 which was exactly the truck I could have used.  Well the one there at the store was being sold, but the Sales Manager(SM) told us he could get a blue one in a about 3 days that was slightly used, I was very excited because it was a nice navy blue and it was a bigger nicer truck than I was used to.  My dad had gone down and discussed the prices and such with the SM and thought he was a cool guy and all.  My dad even brought him deer venison as a gift and ate it with him.  

Well we get the messege the truck is in and I'm exploding in excitement an 18 year old with a 2018 truck is just awesome.  I had worked 3 jobs for the past 3 summers so I was excited and my dad said he would do the down payment for me as a graduation/birthday/ pity gift.  Well we pull into the dealership and I see a blue roof which was amazing.  

A quick side note. We had paid a little extra to get the truck detailed as it was slightly used.  I was expecting a clean truck.  We pull and see the bottom littered in dust and dirt and grime.  Me being passive as I am shrug it off snd say hey I can wash it... my Dad being a straight shooter is furious.  

We open the door to find mud all through the carpet, dashboard, speakers, and seats.  My jaw is dropped.  My dad stands straight up and we walk inside and see our salesman and the Sales Manager there.  
M= sales Manager
S= Salesman

Dad: hey I thought I asked you to clean the truck.   
S: I did, 
Dad: You looked over it and everything?
S: Yep clean as a whistle.
Dad: it is littered with mud and was not washed at all.
M: get out of my office I'm busy with my Salesman!
Dad: I'm a customer here about to buy a 5digit truck from you guys and your telling me to get out of your office?  
S: The mud must have came from the boots of the detailer
Dad: now you can bullshit other people but not me, come out now and look at the thing.
M: Dont you smart off to my fucking Salesman
Dad: C'mon was I smarting off to you? 
S: I didn't t think so
M: You cant just fucking come in here and smart off to my employee, you dont have to but the truck here.
Dad: Good were fucking out of here.  You didnt do your service, or put mudflaps on the fucker. We are out.

We went over to the Ford Dealership and complained where my Dad's usual saleswoman tried to talk us into a car, but my dad was furious at this point.  He knows what it Is like because he is a restaurant owner and we would never have said anything like that.  Becayse the dealerships were owned by the same person we just decided screw these guys.  We went up north a ways the same day and bought a 2019 Tacoma Offroad in red.  

Same color, size and trim as my Dakota was.  Things have a weird way of playing through.

So I go through the drive-thru of the local arches of gold. I ordered a sausage biscuit with cheese and a large Diet Coke. It was $2.63. I handed her $10.03. She gives me the receipt and change and I pull up to the 2nd window and get my food and pull away. Get about a block away and attempt to put my change in my wallet. 

She shorted me $5.

I'm positive of this because I had just left the ATM @ my bank where I got a $20 &amp; a $10. Other than the random change in my console, that was my only cash. I considered letting it go, but I work hard for my money. So I made a U-turn and went back in. Told the manager and she walked away and returned with a 5 dollar bill. Handed it to me.

I'm 99.9% sure that the cashier shorted me on purpose because the receipt was correct but the $5 wasn't there. Figure if she pulled that once an hour during a normal shift she could pocket an extra $200 per week. Not too shabby.

204,Hwingal,0,t3_b6wlzk,45,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b6wlzk/having_to_cancel_a_trip_due_to_mil_suddenly/,"So a friend told me this today, she’s the customer in question but doesn’t use Reddit. 

Background info: her boyfriend’s mother recently passed from cancer (Tuesday), and the last year has been super stressful for the entire family, her included. They knew it was terminal but did not know when. My friend has been 100% involved and helpful and is working hard at trying to support her SO and his family in this time of grief.

So my friend had a 2-day trip booked for April since some time back. With the unfortunate passing of her “MIL”, the funeral would coincide with the trip so naturally she wanted to cancel it. The trip was non-refundable with the company, but due to the sudden passing she wanted to check with her insurance if she could claim something on it. The two insurances she has that offer this service weren’t convinced easily - she was told by one to show proof of her MIL’s passing AND proof that she hadn’t been paid by the travelling agency. They also said they weren’t sure she classified as close family since they weren’t married (but they live together). When she sent them the booking confirmation that included the “this booking is non-refundable” statement, they did not accept it and again asked for proof that she had not been refunded.

So she reached out to the travelling agency, asking if they could just give her some form of proof that they hadn’t paid her.

Well, to her surprise, the customer rep put her on hold, and when he came back he said the payment would be processed back in full within 15 bank days. They didn’t have to do it, but they did, and for someone who’s going through a really rough time I thought that was such a human and kind thing to not only accommodate her request, but go beyond it. Not only because of the money being returned, but also for saving her the hassle of trying to make a claim while being in the middle of a grieving period.

Made me really happy for her, and sorta humbled by the kindness of the company, I wanted to share somewhere. 

Tl;dr: friend had to cancel her non-refundable trip due to sudden loss in the family, insurance company was being difficult, the travelling agency came through and refunded her in full. ",1,Having to cancel a trip due to MIL suddenly passing away.,1730

Ok, here’s how it went down. I’m a really short girl and I was 14 in this story so I looked even younger than I actually was. I was running late to the movie theater, my dad was slow to drop me off, and I had friends waiting for me. However, I like to make my movie theater experience feel complete with snacks and a drink. I was very nervous being by myself and was really shy when I purchased a small popcorn and drink. The guy behind the counter was in his late teens, looked really bored, and was chewing bubblegum loudly. He hands me the “empty” cup and bag of popcorn and motions toward the nearest fountain machine. The movie was about to start, so I hurried over and filled up my drink with a cocktail of a bunch of fruity sodas. I’m about to put on the lid when I look down and see CHEWED UP GUM   floating on the top of my drink. I was disgusted, but I was a doormat and running late. So I just poured out the drink, rinsed the cup with water a few times, and filled it up soda again. Nowadays, I wouldn’t care about the movie, I would walk my tiny self over and ^politely ^ask ^for ^a ^new ^cup.

The whole movie I barely took a sip from my drink because who knows what germs that asshole had? And if you were wondering, the movie was Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Sorry there wasn’t a resolution, I’ve gotten a lot better at standing up for myself since then.

Sales associate= SA


I was in a hardware style store today, looking for storage shelving. I find the perfect shelving unit- heavy duty and on sale! The sign sitting on the box stated $169.99, on sale for $100 

I schlep this huge box to the till, where I made the acquaintance of a bitter sales associate. 

SA: this shelf has a dent. ( how she knew, I don’t know)

Me: can I return it if the dent makes the shelf unusable? 

SA: it’s dented 

Me: yes, that’s no problem, I just need assurances that it’s not a final sale. 

SA: I don’t know where the dent is. I can’t guarantee anything. 

Me: ok, is it a final sale?

SA: huff, puff, fine, you can return it. 

She rings it up as 169.99, so I quickly run and grab the sale sign showing 100


She responded by peeling off the tag on the box that showed 169.99, minus 30%. Well, I was surprised, as I hadn’t seen the sticker. 

SA: do you want the 30% off, or pay 100. 

Me:well, 30% off is less of a discount than the signage so ... I’ll pay the 100??? 

SA: no, that’s for one that’s not damaged. Yours is dented. 

Me: there are literally no other shelves there. 

SA: well, there could be. 

Me: but there’s not. I’m supposed to pay MORE for a damaged product?

SA: well, this sign is showing less than the discount! I just bought this exact shelf! I paid more! You’ll have to pick another. 

Me: that’s not how this works... you have a sign sitting on top of  box showing $100... that’s what I’d like to pay. 


She calls up her manager and while she does, I can’t help but ask her...


Should I not be receiving 30% off the final price, then? Seeing as you keep telling me that’s the discount for the dent??


Her manager came, looked at the signage, the price on the box and told her $100, minus 30%

So just a month ago, I had to contact a customer representative to settle some confusions about my phone payments. I decided to just use chat as I struggle explaining things in English as it is not my native tongue. It took us quite a few “holds” so he could resolve it and so he could give me an accurate answer to my questions. He was very polite putting me on hold and kept thanking and apologizing for it. He seemed a new guy in that position. I didn’t see any problem with it and I kept telling him to “take your time”. 


Although the call would have been shorter, I thanked him for his help and for resolving the issue. It was my first time getting a compliment for being so patient with him in somewhat lines like this:


Agent: Ma’am, thank you so much for your patience. I really appreciate you giving me time to look for the right answer for your inquiries. If only all customers are like you, no days would be considered bad for us.. I hope the best for the rest of your day.”


I felt good for making things easy for him but at the same time I felt bad as to why he would say like having a good customer is not a normal thing for him. I wonder, how hard is it to just be polite to these people who just want to help you? Oh well.. I can only do as much as I could.

So me and my friend we're staying at his dad's. His parents are divorced and live in different nearby houses. We often order food through a dutch app called thuisbezorgd. It was about 12AM and we ordered pizza and some Ben &amp; jerry's from a store somewhere in a nearby town.

The app said that the maximum waiting time should have been about 60minutes... NOPE 2 entire hours go by and my friend is starting to fall asleep slowly from how late it is. At this point we're expecting them any moment but still nothing. Then suddenly my friend gets a notification that our order was delivered asking him for a review so we pretty much assume that the store closed or something and give up all hope at receiving our food. Then he gets a call from his mom. Take in account it is about 3AM in the middle of the night at this point. His mom, all scared, tells him that she got woken up by ""an angry man banging at her door and yelling"" and starts asking him if this has anything to do with him. We instantly know and he tells her it must be the pizza guy at the wrong house and tells her to relax and apolosiges.

About 5 minutes later, low and behold, shows up the pizza guy in his car. He told my friend that he was possibly sent to the wrong adress and with an expression of complete incompetence and stupidity apologised to my friend. My friend being extremely nice and super tired just accepted the meal and didn't tip the guy, leaving him in the rain. Our pizzas at this point we're lukewarm, also burnt pretty badly and the ben and jerry's we're completely crushed by some heavy object and melted completely all over into the plastic bag it was in. (Not to mention those ben&amp;jerry's cost about 7euro which is quite a lot for an icecream)

So it turns out a previous time weeks before this we had ordered pizza at the same store but from his mom's house. And what we think happened is these people being just so incompetent probably still had the adress in their car navigation or something and assumed we were on the same adress as last time. Anyways this was the absolute most absurdly bad customer experience I've ever had with any delivery service. After looking into the reviews of this store we found another review of a person having the exact same problem as well along with a whole host of bad reviews. Safe to say we never ordered here again. Holy shit.

A few years ago, Mom was diagnosed with lung cancer after a routine test (she’s never been a smoker so it was a shock to us all). Doctors decided she would need surgery and everything was booked for about a month after her diagnosis. 


Unfortunately, the surgery was scheduled the day before my parents were supposed to be coming back from a 2 week trip (they are frequent travelers). After some discussion, my parents decided to still do the first week of the trip with my aunts and cancel the second week so that they would get home 4 days before the surgery. 


Mom set about canceling hotels, car rentals and changing their plane tickets. Everything went smoothly, didn’t lose too many deposits until she got to the plane tickets. Because of the locations they were flying to, there were limited airlines/flights and the flights were already pretty expensive so the change fees and the cost difference were going to be significant. But my parents decided they could deal with loosing the money, Mom’s health was more important. 


So she called up the airline to get things changed and since it was a complicated process she was on the phone with the agent for a while. The agent asked why she was making the changes and Mom explained about the diagnosis, surgery and how they still wanted to do part of the trip as it would be a good distraction before the surgery. The agent then put Mom on hold for a few minutes. When the agent came back on the line, he said that the airline was going to wave the change fees and the cost difference between the old flights and the new ones. Completely unexpected but very appreciated by my parents as there were stressed out by the diagnosis but still trying to have a somewhat normal vacation. 


They had a great time on the trip (kissing a fish was involved, that was odd to hear about), the surgery was a success, Mom is cancer free (but missing 1/3 of her left lung) and they still take several trips each year. ",1,Airline makes a kind gesture,94

We asked our waitress for a box for our food, and she tells us she can't give us one since the half priced burgers are 'dine in' only and aren't allowed to be taken home.

&amp;#x200B;

So us sitting there for over an hour isn't dining in? Apparently, they don't want people ordering burgers for half price then immediately taking it home. We weren't doing that. We were dining in and got full. It just astounds me that they would rather throw away the food and waste it than have me take it home and finish it later. They are still making money no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end we had to pay full price for our burgers just to take it home. Is this a common rule in restaurants?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: thanks for the all the replies! To clarify, I don't blame or hold any hard feelings to the waitress. She seemed to feel bad she couldn't give us a box, and even said she would have given us one but her manager was there that day. She even went to ask her manager if she could give us one, but the manager said no.

Also, I understand the rules at sushi places and wing places for all you can eat. I've been to an all you can eat sushi place, and you weren't allowed to take any home and were charged extra for any unfinished pieces. I understand why they did this. However, not letting me take one burger home is a bit weird to me. It's not like I ordered multiple.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: He responded!

""The reason feignedgrace is we had a number of people abuse the  program and order a number of items to go.  That is not the intent of  the rule.  We have talked about revisiting the program and allowing  individuals who haven't finished their food to take it home.  We will  mostly likely do this!  If a party decides to order multiple items to go  we will however not allow that on 1/2 price food items which will still  say on the menu in house dinning only! Sorry for the inconvenience, we  hope you enjoyed your meal otherwise!""

I have since edited my review and rating to reflect his response, and have let him know that if he changes this rule, I will definitely be back since their cheesy parmesan tator tots are da bomb",1,Didn't finish your burger? Well you can't take it home and we are just going to toss it.,1140
212,reddituser10134,0,t3_b720xa,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b720xa/its_your_fault_and_this_is_why/,"I never thought I’d have something to post about on this thread but I just realized that after my day yesterday, oh man do I. So about a month back I hired a moving company to help me move out all of my stuff from my apartment and into the new apartment that my sister and I will be sharing. When I had told my sister about this, she had asked me to go ahead and hire them for her as well which I gladly did because it meant it’ll be less stress for us and all we would have to do is pack everything up and the movers could do the rest. 

I have never used movers before so when it came to the details of movers I only knew what the owner of the moving company had told me which was it would only cost me 75 dollars an hour for 2 hours and he would cut out the cost of everything else for me. So I was thinking oh wow this will be great. About 45 minutes before the movers were scheduled to show up I had even called the boss who I will call Paul and went through the whole payment process and asking what the preferred payment would be and etc.

So around 10 in the morning yesterday, the mover (yes one mover) shows up and he tells me that his employee had a flat tire and that he would be running late so he would go ahead and pack up everything at my apartment by himself and his employee would meet us at the other place. So I was like oh sure go ahead. Now a little context, every conversation I had with this guy he made it seem like he was the owner of the company I hired the movers through. 

So then about 40 minutes later, we packed up the stuff I had which was basically just my bedroom and then we were off to my sisters apartment where the other mover was supposed to meet us. When we get there there is still no sign of the second mover and we start to question the mover that was with us but he kept saying oh no he will be here at this time or he will be here soon. As a person, I understand that things happen and I was like ok no problem. But at this point my sister and her fiancé had a whole apartment that we needed to have moved out and into another place so we ended up having to help this guy while we waited for his mover to show up. 

Needless to say the other mover NEVER showed up and we were stuck helping (and by helping I mean we basically had to move in 75% of the stuff we owned) because we were getting charged by the hour. So I figured ok since he’s the boss maybe he will give us a discounted price per hour since there was only one mover and we were having to do the work of what we paid someone to do. Also I’m not trying to come off as lazy because I tried to make it as easy for the movers as I could. I just didn’t expect to be doing as much as we had and having to pay to basically move ourselves in. If I had known that I wouldnt have hired someone to begin with. 

Sorry for the long context but this is what brings us to the most annoying part which was when we were over, the mover started to calculate how much we owed him. He said for him working four hours, we would have to pay him 600 dollars which was absolutely ridiculous to us because why would we pay someone 600 if he had to help him the whole time and all we had was one mover. We ended up having to talk him down and he said fine I’ll give you a discount of 400 but that’s all I can do. At this point we were all pissed because we had paid one person 400 dollars and we had spent our day helping him move our stuff in when we could’ve been unpacking things while movers brought the boxes in. 

So after the mover left, I thought about it and It was almost like it would make me more upset. So I decided to call the guy that I had assumed was the boss and our mover but it ended up not being him and was someone else entirely and this is basically how the conversation went. 

Me: Hi I am pretty sure you might have been the person that had just moved us but after giving it some thought I was hoping to talk to someone else about what had happened today.

Paul: what are you talking about? I am the boss. I had sent you movers. What do you mean talk about what happened today? 

Me: oh I’m sorry from the way the guy had talked today and even represented himself, he had acted like it was you.

Paul: no that was not me so what happened today?

Me: well all day today, while we were supposed to have 2 movers, we only had one. we were basically forced to help this mover move everything out because we had to pay for his service per hour and didn’t want to get stuck paying more hours since he was by himself. And then we were charged 400 dollars and that was with his “discount”

Paul: HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE TALKED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM YOU COULD HAVE CALLED ME. WHY DIDNT YOU CALL ME. HES NOT EVEN THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE FINANCES WHY WOULDN’T YOU HAVE CALLED AND VERIIFIED THE PRICE BEFORE YOU HAD PAID. 

(This rambling went on for a couple of minutes and every single time I even tried to talk he would just yell at me and start to talk over me)

Me: look Paul, the guy you hired acted like this was his company and he was the one in charge of it and we didn’t realize that you’re not the mover. I had called you this morning and had even asked you about how the payment process works and you should have told me that these were contract movers that you hire and they are not in charge of finances.

Paul: BUT WE HAVE TALKED MULTIPLE TIMES AND YOU STILL WAITED TO CALL. WHY WOULD YOU LET ONE PERSON MOVE YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN NOT TO LET ONE PERSON DO THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU NEVER TRIED CONTACTING ME.

Me: again Paul, I did not realize the mover wasn’t you. From the way we have talked and the way he talked I assumed it was you.

Paul: WELL I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU, YOU SHOULDNT HAVE LET THE MOVER DO THAT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME. YOU ALSO SHOULDNT HAVE PAID HIM 400 DOLLARS WITHOUT CHECKING WITH ME FIRST.
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS YOUR FAULT

and let me tell you , that as SOON as he told me that this was my fault, I was angry. And I definitely did not let him finish that sentence because I was tired from having to help a mover that I hired to move everything  for me. 



Me: excuse me what do you mean this is my fault. You say that this is your company which means that you’re in charge of the employees you hire. Which means if one of them can’t make it, I would trust that they would communicate it to you if you are legally not allowed to do that. (I only know that because he even told me that). I also would hope that you would communicate with your employees through the moves that way you know if anything is happening like this. I cannot help it that your employee had practically impersonated you and then took more money than he was supposed too. Because from our first phone call I would’ve only been charged 300 for today and somehow I was still charged 400 for one guy to help us move everything with him. 

At this point Paul and I had a long conversation where he continued to yell at me which led me to handing the phone off to my sisters fiancé because the whole time we talked he would constantly interrupt me and tell me how wrong I was and this whole situation was my fault and it wasn’t the companies. 

In the end, after two phone calls he said that although it wasn’t the companies fault, he didn’t want to give off a bad impression (or get a bad review on google) and he is supposedly going to reimburse us 100 dollars which means we still paid 300 dollars to do pretty much all of the work that two movers were supposed to do. I really do not mind helping but if I had known we were going to do everything, we would’ve rented a u-haul which would have been extremely cheap compared to how much we ended up paying him. I was also really frustrated because instead of listening to me, he immediately went off on me kept pointing the blame towards me. 

Maybe I’m wrong but I feel that as a customer I am not supposed to be knowledgeable about everything and if there were things i was supposed to know then I should have been told from the beginning. 

(I’m so sorry for the endless rant but I’m now 300 dollars poorer and will never use Pauls company to move anything for me again)

So not that long ago we went to this place where you ride horses. They talked to us about experience with horses then paired us up with our horses. 

I got a horse that kept trying to step off a cliff. But my cousin got a horse that wasn’t even broke yet. They didn’t say it wasn’t broken they just told her the horse is difficult and doesn’t listen or stay on the trail. She’s experienced but just with riding not with breaking horses nor should unbroken horses be on these trails there is a literal cliff. 

But they put her on it anyway. The horse kept going into the woods which was getting her ran into thorns. They told her to tighten the reigns which in the beginning they told her not to. 

But their the experts so she tightened the reigns and the horse tried to bite her so then the horse ran her through the woods and nearly decapitated her by running her right below a branch. If she hadn’t be experienced and ducked her head would’ve come off. 

The entire way back after my cousin left they shit talked her saying if people listen the horse wouldn’t do that. The person taking us on the trail had a broken horse.

I’ll start with this with saying I am a penniless student with a bad spending habit which often comes back to bite me every so often. This time in question was like no other, I had decided to “treat myself” on payday, and 2 days later I had 0 money as usual. Now I’m with a certain 4 letter acronym bank with which I have a loan I pay every month, £250 to be exact, and this month I had bills coming out which amounted to £250. Now here comes my conundrum in which I had £270 in my account, so enough to either pay my loan, *or* pay my bills. 



So here I am, 9:30pm at night panicking myself into a frenzy because I am due to be royally screwed over by either not paying my loan, or having all my utilities turned off. In a desperate attempt, I ring up their customer service line and hope that someone will answer the call in the next half an hour. Low and behold, by some baby Jesus-esque miracle, the man who answered my call works for the department I’d need to chat to, which despite normally shutting at 6pm, he’d decided to stay late and work on the normal customer service lines.



He puts me on hold so he can switch over to the collection department, which he works in, and then proceeds to tell me that I can delay my payment until next month no biggie. No fees will need to be paid, and it won’t affect my credit score as I let the bank know in advance?! This angel of a man who had decided to stay late has just saved me from living in a dark squat of a house for the next month, and I will forever be grateful to him.



TLDR; a representative managed to postpone a loan I have with said bank until I’m able to pay it back, thus enabling me to be able to pay my bills.",1,A certain bank saved me from having all my utilities shut off by pulling a miracle out of thin air,36

However when I went this past Sunday I left happy with my hair at the salon to then get home and realize that it was orange and honestly looked like I didn't get it done at all. (which is what my boyfriend told me) She spent about 2 hours putting foils in my hair so I think my hair basically turned a really ugly yellow and then she put a dark brown toner on top of it to kinda make it a caramel color but it turned out weird and stripey looking. I didn't want to contact the salon and tell them I was unhappy because I hate confrontation and honestly I just did not want to go back and have her do my hair again.

I quickly found another salon closer to me and met this angel of a stylist who fixed my hair this morning and added a toner and then did a few extra foils to lift it up and brighten everything. However I spent another $120. Do you think I should contact the original salon and try to get my money back? I spent $140 on my first appointment and I just feel like spending $260 on my hair is a bit much when it should have been done correctly the first time.

Their website makes it seem as though they have delivery drivers, but when I received my confirmation email with the ""Where is my food?"" link, it took me to Bore Bash's website. Well, sort of ... it actually took me to a ""this link isn't working right now"" message on Bore Bash. I knew at this point I'd made a bad life decision. All of the third party food delivery services here are truly awful. Buuuut I'd already paid so I hoped for the best.

Oh, sweet child. Sweet, summer child. 

Since I couldn't track my food, I gave the delivery driver an extra 30 mins beyond the expected delivery time before calling Hippotlay to see what was going on with my lunch. Turns out nothing was going on, nothing at all. It was lovingly made and then completely, utterly ignored. No one from Bore Bash ever arrived to pick it up. It was still sitting there, sad and alone. Not completely unexpectedly, Hippotlay told me that there wasn't anything they could do. They don't deliver, so I'd have to call Bore Bash. Fun times!

After some mad sleuthing to find a phone number for Bore Bash ... they apparently *really* want you to email them ... I called and was told yes, I deserved a refund, but no, they couldn't help with that. I'd paid Hippotlay and I'd have to work with them to get my money back. No, it didn't matter that I'd literally just gotten off the phone with Hippotlay, having been told I needed to get help from Bore Bash. No, it didn't matter that I actually just wanted my damn lunch, not a refund. What did matter was that Bore Bash would ever so kindly open a ticket for me through Hippotlay's customer service. Wasn't that awesome of them? Aren't they just the greatest? /sarcasm

Long story slightly less long, I did hear back from Hippotlay's corporate customer service within minutes. A full refund is being processed and they're sending me a gift card. My lunch ended up being a large bowl of impotant rage (I don't recommend it; it was not satisfying in the slightest).

TL;DR: In conclusion, Hippotlay customer service is awesome but their choice of third party contracts leaves much to be desired. Bore Bash, OTOH, is a crap company with shit for customer service.

TLDR at the bottom

So this was a couple of weeks ago. My flatmates and I play for our University football team and had an away game that was a 6hr coach journey away, as the kickoff was 1pm we had to leave our flat at 5am to get to the pickup location so we booked a taxi the night before so that we wouldn’t have an hassle getting transport in the morning.

This is where the fun begins, we get up that morning and get ready to go, we get a text message saying our Taxi is outside, so he head on out to the AGREED pick-up location and “nope, no taxi here” so we look around for a minute and there’s nothing to be seen so we phone up the taxi with the number we have been sent and find out he’s parked at the hotel that’s just over a 5minute walk from us. We ask him to come to us as we have a lot of kit, he agrees.

Another 5 minutes go by and no sign of any taxi which should’ve been here by now, so we phone again, no reply. So we phone the company and tell them the situation, they say they’ll send another taxi out to us and it’ll be just under 10minutes which is ok we should still arrive on time for the coach in that case.

Yet another 15minutes go by and no taxi and at this point it’s looking like we are going to be late for the coach which is a relatively big no-no, so we give up and that company as they are unreliable and luckily we manage to flag down a perfectly timed taxi going by, we all get in and are on our way.

We message our HC saying we have been delayed but are en route and  are half way to our location when we get a phone call from the previous taxi company asking where we are as the taxi has just got to the pickup location, now keep in mind this has been 10minutes later than their original estimate and about 25/30minutes since when the pickup was meant to have happened so we just tell them they took way too long and got a passing taxi, ensue the call handler now berating us for wasting two taxis, calling us idiots and generally trying to blame us for their 2 fuck ups, now I wasn’t the one on the phone to her so can’t hear what’s being said but I could hear her shouting through the phone. Turns out she tried demanding we pay for the taxis that didn’t arrive and was promptly told that we would do no such thing as it was their shitty service that caused the issue.

We ended up getting the bus on time and making the game (although we lost pretty badly).

We've been friends since college and live near each other.  The husband's first job required that he travel extensively (he used to get handwritten Christmas cards every year from the CEO of Continental); his job was to meet with and interview individuals all over the country.  

During his first year of this job, right out of graduate school, he had to meet with a man at a very rural location in a large Western State.  He flew into the one of the only cities in the State the night before, rented a car, checked into a hotel, and then drove 6 hours to guy's house first thing in the morning.  

Other than a coffee from the lobby of the hotel, my friend didn't eat anything for breakfast and had assumed that he'd be able to stop somewhere along the way and get lunch.  He didn't realize how rural and isolated this Western State was and that there wasn't anything between the airport and this guy's house.  

He met with the guy, did the interview, and then asked the guy if there were any restaurants in the little town.  The guy laughed and explained that nothing was there, but that he could give my friend a liquid meal replacement shake (it was all that the old man could eat and was all that he had to share).  My friend eagerly took it, said thank you, and then proceeded to make the long drive back to the airport hotel.

However, my friend didn't realize that liquid meal replacement shakes have added fiber in them.  And some people do not do well with this type of fiber...

About four hours into the six hour drive back, my friend start getting severe cramps.  His insides were not reacting well to the fiber.  He was in pain, needed to take a shit, but wasn't able to do since he was in a car driving along a highway in the middle of nowhere.  

Right before he got town and his hotel, he lost his frantic and painful two hour battle with the fiber; he shit himself with explosive diarrhea.  

He parked his car, ran to his room, and got himself cleaned up.  The problem now was what to do with the pants?  These were no ordinary pants!  These were $250 wool slacks and with his and his wife's student loans and his limited salary, $250 was a lot of money.  He didn't want to throw them away and didn't want to wash them in the sink and ruin the wool.  His solution was to put them in two tightly tied plastic bags and to take them home for his wife to deal with that weekend.

When he gave them to his wife, she had no desire to clean them and decided to take them to the dry cleaners.  She was too embarrassed to give them directly to the lady at the counter, so she slipped the plastic bag in a pile of other clothes and just dropped them off at the counter.

She went back several days later and gave the lady her claim ticket for her clothes.  The lady took the ticket, put it into the system, and then got a look on her face.  She reached under the counter and pulled out the plastic bag.  She gave it and the other clothes to my friend and told her ""you no come back!""

It really helps to have good management training you so you can feel confident and customers still get what they need. Unfortunately this isn’t always the case.

This happened just a few hours ago. I was babysitting and was given $40 for pizza for myself and the kids. I called the pizzeria and a young teenage girl answered by the sound of it. She spoke slowly and carefully.

“Hi, do you want delivery or pickup?”

“Delivery please.”

“Ok can I have your name?”

I gave her first name and asked if she needed last name too. I heard her pause, then hurriedly whisper-ask someone in the background if she needed my last time. She got my name, phone # and address and I placed my order. I had a question about the menu and she once more whisper-asked someone else so I figured she was in training and it might have been her first day. Inwardly I was smiling to myself. I’d been there before too.

After I placed my order I asked her for the total so that I’d be able to make sure I had enough. I was getting an extra salad for myself in addition to the pizzas for the kids. She took a moment and then said $28-something. I thought it seemed a little low but maybe they had a deal for the pizzas or something, so I was happy. I had my $40 and planned on asking for $5 back in change and all would be well.

When the pizza was delivered, I took the items and prepared to hand the guy the $40 and he said the total was $42. I blanked for a moment before I had to excuse myself to scramble for another $10 from my wallet. I was rather frustrated because I would have taken off the salad if I’d known how much it was.

So when you're gonna board a plane as a UM, they give you a tiny platic purse that contains information about your flight, etc. They put it around your neck at first.

So back on July 26, I noticed a $60 charge on my card for the online services for the next year. Keep in mind I am a college student so that’s at least two weeks’ worth of gas money for me. I figured no big deal, I will just call and get a refund because within 30 days of purchase Microstupid will always give you a full refund. When I called customer support a few days later they informed me it was renewed on June 26th and a month had passed. This meant I couldn’t get a full refund.

This was the first thing that annoyed me because it seemed way too intentional  to charge me exactly month after the renewal. This was just another way to squeeze a little guaranteed money out of me. I already hate they force auto renewal of subscription every time you purchase just to prey on the people that forget about recurring bills.

I tried to fight it but in the end I accepted the adjusted refund because I didn’t have the correct notification email listed, even though my account email was my correct one. This adjusted refund would be for 11 of the 12 months the charge was for. Since I paid $60 I figured I would get about $55 back which they confirmed to be the case.

I should also note that when I called I asked to cancel my subscription and for a refund.

Fast forward to October and I still had no refund. Not only did I not have a refund but I got charged $10 for one month of online services. I had already called again since August to inquire about my refund and every time I was told it was being process and to wait a little longer. So I call again in October to Cancel my subscription, get a refund for October, and find out where my original refund was. This took hours with customer service because most of the people taking these calls can’t handle more than one thing at once and need to be constantly reminded of what you need. It didn’t help that they kept getting the current refund mixed with the original one. But luckily in the end of this phone call I did get my subscription canceled and my October refund all handled, but still no word on the original refund.

Also note that I did receive the full October refund within a week.

Fast forward again to November, I have called multiple times since October and now they are telling me to contact my bank for a refund. My bank couldn’t since it had been too long since the purchase.  I was angry and wanted answers. I call Microstupid and explain how many times I called and how long it’s been and the customer service person looks into it and they tell me “the refund was never processed and that they would put my account under for review, you will hear back within 48 hours”.

More the 48 hours go by and I never hear back from them. Again just another ploy to get me off the phone. I call again and this time was told something a little different. They said “Your refund is being processed but you won’t receive it until December 26“. They had no idea why but I figure at least I have a date.

Come January 16, and still no refund. I call again and spend another 40 minutes explaining everything that’s happened. I have to do this every time I call because if I don’t they just keep getting it confused with the October refund. This time when I call they tell me “your case will be escalated to our highest team and you will hear back within 48 hours”. 

I don’t hear back surprisingly enough and so I call again January 20th. After about an hour with talking to this new guy he refers me to his manager who took no more than 10 minutes to realize my refund was never processed correctly. They send it through and I should receive my refund within the week. 

I finally get my refund back! This is great, right? No! the refund I received is only for $33.76 not the $55 I was expecting. My working theory at this point is that since the guy I original got the refund from didn’t cancel my subscription the refund never went though. But by the time October came around and my subscription got renewed for a new month it counted all the months before it as part of the new adjusted refund. I call again and after a while of explaining and I was actually told I would receive the remaining amount for the refund. Which I thought was way too easy and I was right.
I never receive the remaining amount. I call again and try to explain to them my case but they just couldn’t understand what I was saying. They had no idea why I was promised the remaining amount because they couldn’t do that. They again put my account under review and tell me I would hear back in 48 hours. 

Surprisingly I hear back and they tell me “Since you accepted the adjusted refund you are not eligible to receive the full amount for the purchase”. I explain to them I was explicitly told I would receive 11 months’ worth of the refund. I hoped they would understand the amount I received wasn’t correct but they didn’t respond back. 

This has happened over months so I might have missed some detail but this is the general story. Please excuse spelling a grammar mistakes. 

Moral of the story is that big companies will do whatever they can to take your money and make it impossible to get it back.

224,kateinlondon,0,t3_b6k09r,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b6k09r/international_customer_service_day_an_idea/,"Hi everyone! This is my first ever Reddit post on my brand new account. Hopefully I will get this right :).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have been working for a startup for two and a half years. We're a tiny company and I've spent quite a lot of that time doing customer service. Sometimes I love the customers and their emails that I want to give them a hug and sometimes the customers are so mean that I have to go have a quick cry in the loo! Life has gone on...and, eventually, I have found it quite cathartic to imagine what kind of honest reply I could write to the rudest customers.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, customer A sends me an email/comments on a Facebook ad (this one is real - name changed):

'$x raised on Kickstarter? I've got an idea for a thumb up your ass. Can I get funding? Jack'

and I imagine that I could reply:

'Thanks Jack, but that was a pretty rude comment. What would your mother say? By the way, stick your thumb up your own ass. Kate'

but, instead, confined by the bounds of 'polite customer service', I must overlook his awfulness and reply with something like:

'thanks for the feedback Jason! Have a great day :)'

&amp;#x200B;

So. I have an idea. How about an International Customer Service Day? For one day, on the same day each year, customer service representatives can reply honestly to customer messages? I feel like this would be win-win-win. The customer service rep gets one day to stand up for themselves in a year of soul destroying work, customers who are generally polite can feel free to let rip and vent all of their emotions, and the consistently rude customers get one day of being reminded that they're talking to a person with feelings.  Could also be pretty funny for everyone involved! I imagine that some people might even save their customer service issues for that day just to get some funny responses.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...one can but dream! Please let me know what you think :)

(Lost some weight so it was too big for me now). All the shops had either cheap tacky ones or big male ones that didn't fit my clothes, so I started asking them if they could help me punch a few extra holes to my belt. (Edit: mentioned it below already, but reiterating that I offered to pay for the service when I asked.)

Every single shop said no except for this one kind salesgirl who agreed to do it, though as I walked away it felt as though her colleague was chiding her. :(

Felt a little bad because she was just doing me a favor.

And also telling stories. Also this is long, drawn out, and hopefully you can feel my frustration dripping out of every single word that I write here. 

There’s a tl;dr at the bottom.


Background info. We’re a military family living on a base in the US. My husband (currently stationed overseas) ordered me 9 bags of potting soil from an the website of a one of the major chain hardware stores, because I’m making a huge garden bed this year in my little 10x14ft standard issue backyard that the base housing has. The order with delivery charge was $110USD. 

He ordered it on Friday on one of his layovers while flying overseas and it was supposed to arrive Sunday. It didn’t arrive, so I check the order status. It now says it will be delivered on Monday. I check again on Monday and it says it was deliver that night at 8pm. Obviously I didn’t receive it. I was confused and a little pissed at this point since i really just want to start my garden. I vow to call the 1-800 number super early the next morning. 



Act I - The Transfers

I wake up, roll out of bed dodging the grabby little hands of my 4 and 2 year old boys, and get my phone. I call the number and it puts me through the automated system and all that tells me is it’s been delivered. Helpful. 

1. So I demanded the robot give me a real person. It gave me a person finally and I explained my situation. She;
2. Transferred me to customer service at the store it was coming from. He;
3. Transferred me to the delivery drive responsible for my delivery. He;
4. Says “what are you talking about? I’m several states away and I don’t know anything about this delivery!” He;
5. Transferred me to the delivery driver at the store closest to me. He;
6. Transfers me to the customer service desk in his store. 

The last transfer gave me an assistant manager (AM) and he did a little bit of digging to figure it out and told me the delivery driver had loaded up my dirt and then never delivered it. Greaaatt. But he refunded me the $35 deliver charge for the inconvenience and told me it would be delivery by the end of the day. I told him that would be great! 

The end of the day rolls around and still nothing. The online tracker tells me it will be delivered the next day (Wednesday) now. I consider myself a patient person but i was pretty much at the end of it. 

So I put my boys to bed and call the 1-800 number again. I get the robot and it tells me my order has been delivered. I take a deep breath and prepare myself. Then I demand the robot give me a person. 



Act II- The Dueling Managers

It gets a bit confusing here so here’s a guide. In order of appearance. 

Cast-
OR -online customer service representative
SR - customer service rep in the store
SM - store manager
OS - online supervisor

I get an online customer service rep.

OR - well this is just unacceptable. I’m going to be here with you every step of the way to figure this out for you. We’re going to call the store and get a manager.

So she calls the store it was supposed to come from. I can tell she’s just as pissed as I am that I was going through this. She was amazing and ready to go in there swords drawn, banners flying for me.

We get SR rep and OR asks her to get her manager. She sends us to the endless ringing cycle of doom and after about five minutes of waiting, SR hangs up and we call again. We get the same OR as before. 

OR- “We just sat on that line for five minutes. Either we need to get a manager or you need to help us with this problem. 

SR- “...I’ll page my manager.”

Enter SM stage right. We explain the situation and she listens very carefully about the situation. I then mention that I live on a military base in state A. 

SM- “what?! We’re in state B, 13 hours away from there! I need to speak to your supervisor.”

OR gets her supervisor into it. Enter OS stage left!

OS is briefly brought up to speed about the situation because we’re all confused as to why my online order was sent to store in state B when the deliver address is in State A. As they’re looking into it I casually mention that my husband ordered it while on a layover. Light bulb! 

SM - “wait! Did your husband have a layover in state B?”

Me -“yes he did!” 

Apparently the automated system automatically sent the order to the store nearest to my husband at the time, which was in state B. So now we had to get it fixed.

Their system doesn’t allow them to simply transfer the order to a different store. So the SM has to return my order. However my husband strangely paid with PayPal and she didn’t get an option to return to PayPal. She obviously couldn’t give me store credit because when will I ever be able to spend $75 at a store 13 hours away from me. She she had to cut me a check. A literal snail mail, take it to the bank check. It will take 7-10 business days for me to get my refund. 

SM- “Welp! I’m done here so good luck you guys!” (Obviously paraphrasing) 

She hangs up and the OS has to complete a completely different order for me so I can finally get my soil. She give me a $40 online gift card that she puts towards my purchase for me. It basically covers the shipping fee and the tax. It will be there Friday. I thank her and tell her what an amazing job OR was doing and how I really appreciated her help. We hung up. 

Friday rolls around and nothing. The online tracker says it will be here on Saturday then. Whatever. I wait until Saturday and about noon the delivery driver pulls up and unloaded my nine bags of dirt. I’m happy and I thought that was it. 

It wasn’t it. 


Act III - The Delivery Driver

Two days later (Monday) I wake up to my phone ringing. 

Cast-
DR - the delivery driver
OR2 - a second, significantly less helpful online representative
AM - the same assistant manager as before in Act I. 

DR- “Um ma’am I have your order here but I can’t get on the military base because I don’t have my license.” (You need a valid license and be able to pass a background check to get on base so no felonies)

Me- “what are you talking about?! I’ve already received my order?”

DR- “I don’t know, but can you meet me off base so I can give you your order?” (Lol)

Me- “No I don’t have a car big enough for 9 bags of potting soil and I’ve already received my order. I’m calling to make sure I’m not being charged twice.”

So I call the 1-800 number. Again. 

I get OR2 and fill her into the situation and ask for a supervisor. 

“Oh you just need to call the store it’s coming from and get them to figure it out. I can’t see anything from my end.” (Bullshit) she didn’t even try to connect me. I ask for the supervisor again and she give me another bullshit excuse.

Whatever. I hang up and call the store it’s coming from.

I get the same AM as before. The one who refunded the original orders $35 delivery charge. I explain the situation to him and tell him I’m just trying to make sure I’m not being charged twice because I hadn’t yet received my snail mail refund from the store in state B. 

After he confirms that I did not actually order 18 bags of dirt he did a little digging. Apparently the order that I had already received was the order my husband put in and had been canceled. The one that was trying to be delivered was the one the OS put in for me. AM told me he was just going to cancel this delivery and for the inconvenience...he was going to refund my $35 delivery charge. 

You know. After I had already been given a $40 gift card for the delivery charge by the OS. I said thank you and have a great day.



Tl;dr - after a long and drawn out process involving 12 different employees with a shitty automated system I got 9 bags of potting soil for $35.

What a shit show. 

Edit: Several people have asked why I didn’t pick up the soil myself instead of going through all of this. I have two high energy boys under 4 all to myself since my husband is overseas. I don’t have room in my car for 9bags of dirt, and I have a hard time driving off post since we live in an area with crazy traffic and I have major anxiety when driving in traffic stemming from a crazy car accident that happened when I was 32 weeks pregnant with my first baby. Plus my husband wanted to make it easier for me to make up for having to leave home AGAIN. Of my 2 year olds life he’s been gone for 19 months of it. It’ll be worth it once he retired, but gosh darn it! It’s hard right now. 

Edit2: Thanks for the gold!! It’s my first. ",1,I just wanted my bags of dirt....,264

Tonight I decided to go bowling with my friend and my boyfriend, and saw first hand the effects of being the only bowling alley most people know of in the immediate urban area. (TLDR at the bottom).

This bowling alley has an arcade, where you can win tickets. We had some spare change and decide to spend it at one of the coin dropping games that can win tokens. We play for a while until it freezes, we have £2 left in the machine (was silly to put two coins in, but the machine didn't want to accept one so I kept trying different things with the coin until it got accepted too). The machine says ""call staff,"" so my friend goes to get help and comes back saying someone should be on their way as it should be  a simple fix.

Ten minutes go by and nada, so I figured I'd causally check what's up) I queue patiently and talk to a sweet girl who is surprised that nobody came, so she comes with me personally. When we get there, she clearly has no idea what she's doing but is trying her best (I tell her I have no idea how anyone can deal with these arbitrarily complex machines without a manual on hand). Eventually the man guiding her on her walkey talkey says he's coming over himself.

He starts fixing the machine (he just needed to restock cards that were part of the game), and I inform him that the machine doesn't seem to be giving out the right number of tickets (one token dropped = 5 tickets, but this machine was doing one). As soon as I get closer to discuss the issue, something hits me and I genuinely wanted to vomit (context: I've worked in a hospital). This guy has the worst stench a walking talking human could have. I'm not even convinced he was alive. I had to step back and try not to gag, and do my best to keep up with the conversation. I don't know how anyone let him talk to customers like that, because I genuinely felt queasy for a good while after.

We finish on the machine, get our prizes and start bowling. The first thing I notice is that there's only one spare bowling ball in the room that wasn't already on a lane (context, there was probably a minimum of 12 lanes in the room). We spend most the game trying to share balls with the nice silent guys next to us. 

As we play, I notice a load of tiny children running across the front of the lanes where people bowl. I hope to myself that their parents or a worker deals with it (they vanish pretty quickly). At one point I go to take a swing, but I see kids from the corner of my eye so I stop and turn my head. The bowling ball (which was a super heavy one) was inches away from a young girl's head. Honestly I could see her sustaining  serious damage if I'd not stopped or lost my grip. I just about have enough time to blaspheme under my breath as they vanish into the crowds.

We finish shortly after, and I do end up speaking to a member of staff about the kids. I tried to find them on my way out, so I could tell the parents, but it got very busy.

I wont be going back for a while, but the next time I want to bowl I don't exactly have much choice.

(TLDR: Get forgotten by staff. Had to deal with a guy that almost made me vomit. Then I almost killed a child. I'll probably still go back one day)",1,What happens when there are practically no competitors,18

So I went to this pretty fancy restaurant with my family of 5 the other night and it looked very promising.

A little backstory, I used to be vegetarian for 8 years so I’ve been very finicky about meat since then. 
Everyone orders their food and I decide to take a chance and order some steak. I say to the waitress that I want it very well done, no pink. 
My dad sat next to me and he ordered a steak too but it was a different cut and different dish (sides were different, mine came with a fried egg and his with a mushroom sauce). 

First of all the food took an hour 40 minutes to get here but we’re all pretty laid back people so we decided to just let it roll and enjoy each other’s company. (The restaurant wasn’t overly busy either)
When the food finally arrived (they forgot to put my egg on the steak and also didn’t bring my sister’s extra vegetables, like at all.) I cut off a corner piece to just check and it was very pink. My dad saw and sent it back because I clearly asked for very well done, no pink. I again said to the waitress that I want it very well done. I even used the words “scorched, charcoal, black hole black.” 
After they took it away he noticed his was too cooked so they obviously switched our steaks. 

Fine, miSTEAKS happen. (Sorry, had to.)

It took about half an hour till the waitress brought my steak back and it was the same one with the same corner cut off (this is important). 
Out of instinct I cut through the middle and was absolutely horrified. It was 100% raw in the middle with blood gushing out. 
I immediately pushed my plate away, no way was I going to be able to eat anything after that! 
The waitress kept saying they mixed up the steaks but how does that excuse the fact that I sent it back to cook more and it came back bloody? 

Anyway they took my dish off the bill and when my dad asked her to take the vegetables that my sister never received off too, the waitress replied with “okay but just know I’m going to have to pay for it then.” 

Frustrated now, my dad didn’t care anymore so he just paid for everything and we left. 

To say it was a bloody mess of an evening would be an understeakment. (I can’t help it) 

TL;DR ordered very well done steak. Came pink. Sent it back, same steak came out bloody. Waitress manipulated. I used puns. ",1,Steaks were too high,1113

I was coming back from the last day of the convention and I flew out the next day at like 2 or 3. I called a driving company which I'll call Loft. I got a Loft back to my Air BnB but I left my wallet in the car by accident which I didn't realize until the next day. I freaked out. Because it had my ID in it which is ,ya know, needed to fly, and I texted and called him at around 9am. Thankfully, to what I thought, he replied and said ""of course I can drop it off. I will be there in 15 minutes"" 

15 minutes goes by. Then 30. Then an hour. Then 2. Throughout these 2 hours I had been politely texting him maybe only 3 other times asking for updates and where he was, and got no response. For context I had 40$ cash, my debit card(which I turned off at that point), and a few loyalty cards and my ID in my wallet. Nothing worth stealing honestly. But with no response, I called Loft customer service. 

The person helping was super empathetic and tried her very best to help me, but said that they could not do anything further as he is a private contractor and is not required to contact them. I got to the airport that day and luckily I knew mine and my parents info so I was able to get on my flight home. So I file a police subpoena a couple days later and tell Loft to contact this guy and tell him that. He says to them ""oh I've been out of the country since then and wont be back for 2 weeks"" uh huh. Two weeks go by. No response. File the police report. Loft says as soon as they have the subpoena they will handle it from there. I checked in multiple times and they kept saying he just wouldnt respond. So I guess you can just steal something, go silent, and get away with it. They have all his information. His name, address, everything, but they cant get a wallet back. 
Anyways, It been about 7 months and I've heard nothing. I had picture of evidence of him responding and yet, nothing has happened. Rightfully so I believe I have stopped using Loft because the only helpful person I encountered was the first lady on the phone.

Edit: forgot to mention, he did eventually contact them and they sent him a shipping label which he never used to send the package. And then returned to radio silence

Why am I not a fan? Mostly due to their customer service. I’m kind of a customer service guru (studied it, did it, taught it etc) so it drives me bonkers when customer service is bad. It’s not like one or two employees. It’s like every dang time I go. Yesterday was no exception! 

I had a rebate so I went there to buy a few odds and ends we needed in our house- a few screws, a drain stopper thing, a special kind of glue, etc. 

When I first walked in I smiled at the employees standing there, nodded my head with a “hello” gesture only to be looked at like I had boogers in my nose. I actually got my compact out and checked (I’m a girl btw. I’m handy and I like to build stuff but I look pretty girly so I’m not always taken seriously). Nope. Looked fine. Went straight toward the screws to find one I was missing and passed an employee. “Morning!” I greeted.. only to be looked at and ignored. Ummm ok. Then I went to plumbing. Took me a few moments to find exactly what I wanted. An employee stood at the end of the aisle staring at me but didn’t say a thing. I kind of gave him a have grin like ‘you need this aisle’ and he looked away. Ok.... headed back the opposite way to look at one more thing and passed several employees. I’m a classic mid westerner. I smile, nod, greet like ANYone I pass. I can’t help it. It’s in my dna. No one acknowledged me in the least and basically pretended they didn’t see me... I was really starting to take it personally and assume I looked like a homeless person or something i dunno (I was dressed nicely, hair done, make up🤷🏻‍♀️). Finally, I get to the registers to see an older gentleman standing there waiting on customers to come. I said “are you open?” He says angrily “what??”  I was taken a back but repeated, “are you open? Can I check out?” He grumbles “yes!” But a yes like ‘yes you stupid idiot’. Seriously at this point I’m just done. But I bite my lip, finish my purchase and inwardly declare ‘As God as my witness...!’  For reals. 

My final few moments my umbrella I had used to get in the store was malfunctioning and I was a bit flustered with it and was like “oh my goodness”. I look up to see the two people looking at me at the customer service desk like I was the weird girl in high school and they were the mean girls (or guys). Like their looks made me feel 2” tall. 

I just shook my head, grabbed my stuff and left for ‘Bowes’ to get the rest of what I needed. Everyone at ‘Bowes’ was as nice as could be! So obviously it wasn’t me... 

This is not the first, second, third or 7th problem I’ve had at ‘Lenards’ as far as customer service goes. I hate going there but sometimes ‘Bowes’ just doesn’t have what I need! Ugh. What is it with that store??

So I’m gonna talk about a food delivery app, one which is very popular and is an offshoot from another transport company. Let’s call it Boober Beats. 

I order my food. It’s over $50 of sushi for me and a friend. Driver is highly rated. Cool. My phone is across the room, my food is supposed to arrive around 10:01 PM. I look at the clock and see “oh shoot, it’s 10:00 exactly! Better check my phone and see if Driver is looking for me!” 

I have a notification that he arrived six minutes ago, but no missed calls. Odd. My phone was on vibrate, which I would’ve heard from across the room, so if he had tried to contact me at all I would’ve heard it. So it’s crazy inconvenient and rude that he didn’t call at all once he arrived. I have an accompanying notification from Boober Beats saying that “Your driver can cancel your order with no refund after 8 minutes.” I walk outside and text that I’m coming, and where is he. 

Good thing it hasn’t been 8 minutes, and I have documentation of that fact, right? At this point I’m outside searching for him. I send him multiple texts and call him multiple times. I can see on the app that he “read” the texts, but no reply ever comes. Both the calls ring out to voicemail. I can’t find his car, because it’s not outside my apartment building, meaning it’s somewhere else in the complex. At this point it’s obvious that the man is running out the clock. I keep walking around looking, and finally spot it. 

Driving away. He drives right past me, I see his face and recognize him, I wave frantically. I’m in the road behind him, there’s no way he doesn’t see me. He keeps driving. 

He cancels the order. My $50 of sushi drives away with this man, and he now owns all of it. My order disappears instantly from the app, so I lose all ability to contact him. I immediately call Boober Beats customer service, and here’s where it somehow gets even more ridiculous. 

The person I’m speaking to isn’t just scripted, they’re not even TRYING not to sound scripted. They start with “I’m sorry this happened to your order, what happened?” I explain in detail what happened. She seems to absorb none of these details, and in a conversation so circular it made me dizzy, she managed to repeat herself 7 times “It shows here your driver waited over nine minutes so it is impossible for us to offer a refund.” 

... Yeah, and I couldn’t find him for those nine minutes because he never contacted me and dodged my calls once I checked and saw he was there. And then he saw me and drove away anyway. Does she care? Of course not. She repeats herself mechanically, zero listening. I ask if there’s someone else who CAN offer a refund, so she says “I can transfer you to my supervisor” and I go on hold for about 2 minutes. The line picks back up, and who answers?

The same woman. Claiming to be a supervisor. 

Call me crazy, I don’t care, this woman’s voice was INCREDIBLY distinctive. I’m not a suspicious person or a disgruntled customer by nature, but both of my friends who were in the room listening at the same time said “oh my god is that the same woman?”. There’s no way it was someone else. She reads from the same script, acknowledges nothing I say, and I wish her a good night and end the call. 

My friend tries calling, since $25 of her sushi was also in the car and she’s pissed. The call goes exactly the same way, and although she’s much more insistent and persistent, it goes nowhere, and this time THEY hang up on HER. 

Call me crazy, but since I was literally unable to get to my food despite trying very hard... I don’t think my delivery driver “waited” for over nine minutes. He marked his location for Boober Beats and hid from me til he could leave with my food. But none of these details matter to Boober Beats. 

I ended up calling my bank to reverse the charge, and even though it was 11 at night, I had no problem explaining the situation to them, and it was a quick pleasant call. Shoutout to Chayce bank for actually listening to their customers when they get robbed by another company’s delivery driver. 

Moral of the story, if you must use food delivery services, be sure you have a good bank
first. 

TL;DR- Boober Beats driver dodges my calls/texts, drives off with my sushi as I wave at him. customer service line is staffed by scripted robots who will hang up on you if you try to get them to listen. Bank saves the day. 

[Major update- GOT REFUND] - Y’all. I don’t know if it had anything to do with the spreading of this post, but after about 5 repeated messages from their “help” section of the app saying that nothing mattered except the driver’s supposed “wait” time, SOMEONE FINALLY REFUNDED ME. It only took about 11 tries over phone and through the app, but **I declare Boober un-cancelled, although they’re still on thin ice with me.**",1,"Sorry, your driver hid from you for 9 minutes so the food belongs to him now, and your $52 is ours.

233,berrylife,0,t3_b5jtye,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b5jtye/my_own_ride_sharing_app_horror_story/,"I saw two other posts about ride share apps today and knew I had to share my own horror story about ‘Luber’. 


I’m a sole mobile user and am typing on mobile, I have no idea why that matters but I see people apologizing for it so it mean something, so sorry in advance for whatever it does.


TL;DR ; Book an hour Luber ride, 10 mins in driver starts asking me for gas money. I refuse, he tries to make me get out on the side of the road, acts as if he’s going to drag me out, relents and drives me home. Screams at me until my friends come to the rescue.

This story takes place a year ago, I had never used any type of ride share apps before, was at a friends partying, party was simmering down, and people were starting to leave. Another friend texts me asking if I want to come over to his place, he has a small party already going over there and I wasn’t ready for the night to end.


Problem was, it’s about an hour drive, the people I came with wanted to go home. It’s way too far out of the way for them to drop me off, I’m too fucked up to drive myself.


Friend who’s party I’m heading too offers to get me a Luber from his phone/account. Less than 10 minutes later he texts me to go outside because my ride was there. I get in the car.


Driver: So we’re going to “city a?” that’s also an hour away but not where I’m going 


Me: No? Am I in the wrong car? Is that where it says I’m going?


Driver: City B? (Also an hour away but not where I’m going)


Me: Were going to city C... does it not say where I’m going? (Again, I had never used the app before but this seemed so weird to me)


Driver: 123 your friends address?


Me: yeah that’s the address.


We’re driving for about 10 minutes and then he says, “I need gas. This is a really far ride.” I tell him it’s no problem, I’m not in a huge rush. 


I was assuming as I think most people would, that he was going to pay for his own gas.

I guess “luckily” he asked me how much I was giving him for gas before we actually got to the station and he pumped it. “I’m not paying for your gas??”


D: “How the fuck do you expect to get there then?? This ride is an hour away!!”


M: “Why did you accept the ride then?” 


D: “it doesn’t tell me where you’re going until I pick you up. If I knew it was an hour away I wouldn’t have came!”


(I have no idea if that is true because I had never used the app before and because of this situation haven’t ever used it since)


M: “but you knew when you picked me up though? And we’ve been driving for a little while”


D: “I’ll just take it off your total, I don’t have any money on me.”


I really didn’t know if he could do that or not (I now know you can’t), but it was my friends account that was paying for the ride, not mine, so I figured that was the best excuse to get out of it, even though I was paying my friend. There’s no way he thought it was my account anyway, because I’m a girl and my friend is a guy with a very ‘guy’ name, so it was believable way to just shut him down without having to fight.


M: my friend is paying for the ride, not me. I don’t have any money.


D: you have an iPhone!!!(so?) I have enough gas to get you there but then I won’t be able to get home, I need the gas money.


M: then just use the money from this ride when it’s over.


D: that’s not how it works.


This isn’t the best thing that has ever come out of my mouth but he was annoying the shit out of me, I was pretty drunk and was pretty certain this guy was just trying to scam me and the fact that he continued to drive towards my destination during all this was proving that even more.

M: Well you getting home isn’t my problem. Maybe the ride after me can give you gas money and you can just take it off their total.

He immediately pulls over on the turnpike.

D: GET THE FUCK OUT

Me: No

He then gets out of the car and walks around to the back passenger seat where I was sitting opens the door.

D: OUT!! YOU GREEDY FUCKING BITCH.

Me: I’m not getting out.

He reaches for my legs as if he is going to pull me out of the car, I have my phone in my hand and whip it up as if I’m filming him. Unfortunately for me, I have a phone case that covers the front and the back, and to use the front you have to fold the front cover over and snap it onto the back, which is how I had it, so the camera was covered. Also, I’m a 5’4 105lb girl and he is a grown man reaching for me, I was actually scared, and couldn’t get the camera open because I was just jamming my thumb at the screen in a panic with text messages open, not even looking at the screen.


Fortunately for me, I don’t think he noticed either of those things and realized a video of him literally dragging me out of a car ride that was paid for being recorded could be a lot of trouble for him.

He puts his hands up and says he’ll take me home he’s not taking me for an hour ride. Which is good because I don’t want to be in the car for an hour with him anyway, so I don’t say anything and I’m typing up a long ass message to my friend who had ordered me the ride and who’s house I was heading too.

He messages me back pretty quickly saying he’s glad I’m okay blah blah blah, tells me to make sure the driver cancel the ride. He didn’t bring me, make him cancel, my friend will be charged if he’s the one who has to cancel.


He starts driving back to my pick up address which luckily had been a friends and not my house. We get to the front and he tells me to tell my “friend” and actually uses the air quotes, to cancel it so he can start doing rides again.

M: just cancel it yourself then.


D: He needs to cancel it!!! I brought you home!!! I could have left you on the side of the road!! 

He is slamming his hands on the steering wheel and starts screaming how I’m soo fucking greedy I can’t even pay for my own gas! Even when someone else is paying for the ride! Do I expect men to do everything for me? TYPICAL SLUT! DUMB CUNT! He didn’t HAVE to bring me home!! I’m a stuck up bitch dumb fucking white bitches!!!!

I love my friends though because the friend who paid for the ride was smart enough to have texted the person who’s house I was going back too that I was on my way back. So I kind of got saved by GOOD FRIENDS tm coming out of the house expecting my arrival. After being briefed on the situation they thought I might be in trouble and correctly deduced that the car with its headlights on in front of the house probably had me inside it and I might need help. 

They came running over, pull on the door handles, doors locked, one friend knocks on the window.

D: if your friends fuck up my car I’m going to kill you. Cancel the fucking ride.

I felt way safer with my friends there and was comfortable that he wasn’t going to chase after me with them all there, and even if he did my friends wouldn’t let anything happen to me. So I unlocked the door and got out, walked inside with my friends. While this guy yelled GREEDY FUCKING CUNT out of the window.

Called my friend who’s account it actually was and told him I was okay but couldn’t get him to cancel the ride. My friend says well the driver has to cancel it now, what is he going to do? Because my friend is not going to cancel, and sure enough the driver did that pretty quickly. My friend had the money for the ride put back into his account the next morning and he called the company and told them what happened. They told him not to book rides for other people but they will handle it and that was the last I heard but I’m hoping handle it mean fire him immediately!

I went to skiplagged and googles thing for flights and found delta was the cheapest. So I went directly to their site and tried to log in over and over until I was locked out and just upset about everything. Said I had to call customer service. I called them to have my account unblocked to reset my password and login so I could book the flight. Representative was super nice, consoling without even knowing the issue just because he could hear how sad/upset I was. I said all I wanted to do was book a flight which he started in the interim of getting me emailed a new reset link. On top of that he got me a medical emergency discount which I thought no longer existed. I was looking online to book the same flight for $400 more. He made me laugh because I have a unique name that is laughable and saying his is worse spelling it and going back and forth and talking about his home country and it just felt like a nice distraction. Waited while I tried for my aunt and cousin to patch in to get the doctors name and phone number and her elderly home address and a bunch of other things to get the flight. Didn’t get it all but was able to book and call back later to complete. He was beyond awesome and made me feel so much better just to talk to aside from the awesome discount and everything else. I’ve always had customer service follow questionnaires when calling but never got one for him. I’m going to write them tomorrow about how great he was. Anyway, the 3-4 days was actually 3-4 hours as she passed away after that. I called back, was on hold for 16 minutes after the initial 8 minute wait time from the automated system, but even with that frustration I was able to cancel the flight even though I had already checked in for it.

My boyfriend decided his phone was biting the dust, so he wanted to get a new one. Neither of us are exactly well off, so we searched around for a deal. We found what we thought was a great deal to get an iPhone 6s and a plan for about $100. When we were switching over, the representative used my boyfriend’s information to call his old provider, which seemed normal. However instead of just reporting the issue, the sales rep IMPERSONATED my boyfriend on the phone without even asking if that was okay. We were ticked, but tried to be polite. He also neglected to inform us that the phone would be locked to that particular company and if my boyfriend wanted to switch to another company he would have to pay $200 and wait 30 days. The service sucks and is extremely slow. Apps and videos take forever to load. Additionally all the store locations in my town are in the shady and run down neighborhoods with equally questionable customers.

237,BnGamesReviews,0,t3_b5dnv9,17,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b5dnv9/eight_packages_in_three_months/,"This is sort of an edited and updated repost of my original thread on this subject. For the past three months I have had now eight packages that Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping has failed to deliver on the date specified. Id be much more understanding typically, but after the forth one within two weeks, my patience is gone. I originally posted it on the Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping Drivers subreddit and it was eventually locked. I think its still valid to post here, because at the time it was Six packages that had not been delivered on time, we're now up to eight.

Packages 1 and 2 both were both items where the package was ""Out for Delivery"" and then suddenly without ryme or reason I get an notice that it was being delivered the next day. When Package 2 was finally delivered, the driver left it in a puddle of water literally 3 steps away from the porch where it would have been protected. THREE STEPS AWAY. When he took a picture of where the package was ""Delivered"" it was from inside his truck/van, of a picture of my driveway and not even remotely close to where he actually left the package. Customer Service had no good answer for that one.

Package three I received a message on Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping stating that no one was home to accept the package, which is completely false as someone was in the living room right next to the front door all day and no one knocked or attempted to get someone to open the door TO deliver the package. When they came back the next day they left the package in the rain THREE steps away from my porch where it would have been protected. Three fucking steps. not only that, if you have ever check the tracking when a Package is delivered they are supposed to take a picture of the package and where it is at. He/She took a picture of my house from across the street from a foggy car window.

For Package number four, I stayed home from work and sat at the door with the wooden door wide open because I have a screen door so no excuses we couldn't hear anyone knocking. I sat at that doorway from 6am to 9pm just to prove the point, and when I got up, I made sure someone was sitting at the door until I got back (Which was really only to go to the bathroom). Sure enough after 9pm there was a message from Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping stating that they had tried to deliver the package and no one was home. COMPLETELY FALSE.

So I canceled prime. As far as I can tell this was all the handy work of the Riverside, CA distribution center. I, however, decided to reup prime, and try getting my packages delivered to my place of work (25 miles from my home) because my office gets packages from Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping all the time and I thought I might have better luck. Boy oh boy was I wrong to expect anything different.

Package Number 5 was supposed to be delivered on the 8th, and as with the first package I got a message that it was delayed until next Tuesday. I did not call Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping this time, resigned that this is what I should have expected. On Tuesday I got a message that they ""Tried"" to deliver the package but could not get past the front door. Now, I left explicit instructions on how to get in and deliver the package as a precaution, even though I know they deliver to my office building ALL OF THE TIME WITHOUT ISSUE. I called Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping and after going through two different supervisors I was told that the Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping Distribution Center had an issue with a belt and that caused the delay and that the message that the driver could not get into deliver the package was automatic. That doesn't make an ounce of sense but what else could I do?

The following day, Package 5 and 6 were supposed to be delivered, the tracker on Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping showed how many stops were left, and by 3pm PST it said I was next on the list of stops on the Online Tracking page. Three hours later, nothing. I called Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping again and the first rep was very nice and was patient but had no information. Supervisor number one was an uncaring prick who told me that one of the items was out of stock to which I replied ""Then why did it show it was on it's way to be delivered?"" No answer. I also asked why I was told the distro centers belt line was down that caused them to send me a message that they couldn't get into my building. Still no answer, so I told him to get me HIS supervisor.

Now, please do not get me wrong, im having no fun in this situation, and I don't like having to spend hours on the phone to find out where/why my items are not being delivered. Long story short with Supervisor #3 I wasn't going to get it and he had NO details why it wasn't delivered but was assured, as did every other rep I talked to in the last few months, that it would arrive on time THIS time.  Supervisor #3 likened all of the drivers to Uber Drivers in regards to their availability and quality. Nearly shocked me into silence.

EVENTUALLY that week Packages 5 and 6 arrived after fighting on the sub reddits, twitter, and on the phone. I am done ordering anything from Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping for my own needs, but my job still uses prime and sure enough the following Packages ordered for my work again received the message that they could not deliver. Same bullshit that they couldn't get in to deliver when there has never been an issue before, and every other delivery service seem to have no issue either.

It seems that the one supervisor is right, Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping is farming out their delivery service to non-employees and the service is suffering for it. Im not paying for Prime to deal with this horseshit, im making it a point to go to the Big Box stores in any case I can to avoid Big Online Seller that Charges for Free Shipping completely from now on.

This weekend after seeing the recent superhero release, we went to a fast food establishment (Big orange W) in the mid afternoon.  I know this is off-peak time, but there seemed to be enough people working, just no organization.  I'm wondering if they 'lost' a screen of orders or something.  My companion ordered directly before me (only time to pay and ring next order between).  There was 5+ minutes between our food coming out (didn't time directly).  COmpanion indicated several orders than came out before ours were ordered after (I had my back to the tills/most customers).  Drive Thru seemed to be moving well.

When companions food came out my order and another customer's were noted as 'being just about ready'.  And then we waited some more.

My receipt was time stamped 2:44.  My food came out at 3:09.    
Other Lady went to get a refund as she had somewhere to be at an appointed time, which caused much confusion.  Manager made an appearance from where ever she had been.  Still confusion on getting a refund.

I was with my boyfriend at a garden centre grabbing a small number of things when we encounter a young girl at the tills. She was probably working her first job as she looked to be like 16, but boy did she whine! I'll call her whiny teenager (WT from here on out).

One of the main things I got was a set of 8 tiny plants. There was a deal for that amount and a nice little container to put them in. As she scans them she looks straight at me and will a roll of her eyes she begins to talk...

WT: I used to be able to scan them all together, now I have to scan them individually.

Me: oh, that's a shame

WT: it's really annoying but whatever 

Then she gets to a bonsai pot my boyfriend picked up. She takes one basic look at it and sighs.

WT: they didn't put a barcode on this, so I'm going to have to get another...

Me: oh sorry?

She walks off, and my boyfriend follows because he's a sweet angel who felt bad that it could've been 1% his fault. I wait at the till, but I later find out that she found the display, and discovered the barcode was clearly underneath the one we bought the entire time.

We continue the transaction with both of us quietly trying to ignore her continuous whining (hence why I can't recall what she said), pay and then leave quietly.

I think she just saw that we were relatively young (both 24, but most customers were at least 40), and decided we could relate, but we just ended up feeling very uncomfortable because it sounded like we were an inconvenience to her.

I should note a few things: 
1. We went back a few weeks later, she was there but we avoided her till (God knows how she would've handled our significantly more awkward purchase of compost and wet pots)

(Its super expensive otherwise and I've had good experiences doing this before in another state with the same deal site).

I get my consultation,  where I learn the extra large area isn't really extra large and so it's not really as advertised. I wanted to laser ""down under"" and my 🍑 but it turned out to just be ""down under"" which isn't what was listed as a treatment area. Not happy but Deal Site is hard to get a refund from and it's still decently cheap even after a tip each session. 

I schedule an actual session and shave the night before and come in. The room kind of smells a bit ""gassy"" but I'm like, whatever...people are in here busting it open to get zapped by a laser even though my old place never had this issue. I tell the esthetician: I actually only want these specific parts done, skip X part because I dont care about hair there or want to look like a baby dolphin and X part is notoriously sensitive to laser for me (lots of follicles).

She starts and just does it ALL, it went so fast  that I just kind of sucked it up as long as I could. She gets to some *lower* parts and it BURNS. I tell her it's almost unbearable. She goes back in and keeps going at the SAME part and I just stop her completely and tell her I can't bear it. She is concerned that I wont get a good treatment. I ask her what can be done. She says to come back next time 30 min early, buy our $40 numbing cream, and it will help. I agree and stupidly schedule the appointment and even tip because I figure maybe I'm just having a low tolerance to pain.

Cue the next few days. I'm irritated down under. It doesn't look terrible but I feel raw and sensitive and this lasts for days.  I'm afraid to even go back tbh. Now that I'm not in an awkward situation with my privates all out I realize I can't go back and figure I'll take the L rather than go back to that mess. I randomly chat with Deal Site like 2 weeks later to see if I can get a partial refund. I'll pay the equivalent of one session but I dont want to go back. They basically say ""nah, we'll refund the whole thing and were going to contact the relevant department about the situation"". I'm shocked because Deal Site has never been this good about this. 

On the one hand, I really should have checked reviews like I typically do for this stuff. On the other hand,  I've had this done before and typically the estethician would at least offer to lower the power and find a level I could stand. Once I came to my senses I realized that the cream wouldn't stop the irritation the treatment caused and I've bore the pain before for too high of a power and ended up with pink, raw armpits and know to listen to my body now.

So we grab a table off to the left, unbeknownst to us, the server station/main POS is right around the wall we are next to. After a couple minutes of no service we hear “Uh who sat table 76?” And in an extremely narcissistic tone we hear “They sat THEMSELVES...”

Now our service provider has physical store outlets which you can go and choose your new device or get something fixed or just manage your phone plan in general. So we went to our local outlet and proceeded to purchase and set up my new phone on site.

Employee picking up the phone to answer it: (service providers name) this is E1 how can I help you?

E1 waited for a reply only to get no response, thinking it was a butt dial he hung up and returned to helping us.

Not even a minute later the phone starts ringing and again he answers it.

E1: (service providers name) this is E1 how can I help you?

Still nothing, and he hangs up again. I guess we both kinda thought it was the person who called a minute ago trying again due to a bad connection but we still moved on to my phone.

Yet another minute later, phone's ringing again. No, it couldn't be?

E1 answering a third time: (service providers name) this is E1 how can I help you?

Same caller, same lack of response, ends call after a few seconds.

We continue on for another two minutes before sure enough, the same caller is back again trying to contact the store. And again, no response. At this point I can't help but find this a little entertaining seeing as you'd think the caller would just try again later or maybe just decide to come to the store and fix the problem in person. As E1 had to go into the backroom for a thing I can't remember what, the phone goes off again this time answered by the other employee working there. (let's call her E2)

E2: (service providers name) this is E2 how can I help?

Nothing....It was the SAME caller on their FIFTH attempt to call into the store with again... No success. She goes back to her thing when attempt number SIX happens just as E1 comes back from the back room thinking it was try number five instead. I'm just holding in laughter from the whole thing and even after E2 answers it, only for the same process to happen again, even E1 was finding it amusing how comedic the whole situation was. 

Instead of going directly back to helping us E1 just watched the phone... Waiting... Fully expecting for what happened next.

RING

E1 Answers: (service providers name) this is E1?

You guess it! Same caller on attempt number Seven!

E1: I'm sorry but you might have a connection issues as I cannot hear anything you are saying.

(E1 thought that maybe the reason caller was trying to reach them was the same reason he kept getting nothing, that the phone had a issue with outgoing calls and something else possibly, I didn't really ask but I could tell he had an idea on it)

We had just about finished up with my phone when we all just let out a small chuckle as the phone started ringing again and without checking the number ID the phone had we all kinda knew who it was. Because in the time span of not even twenty minutes the same poor caller had tried eight times to call about how their phone was probably not working properly and for eight continues tries had no avail to even getting the other side to hear them.

We left soon after with my new phone and now typing this story out I can't help but wonder if after I left the poor person on the other end had just given up or actually did go on until attempt number twelve or something.

TL:DR went into get a new phone, employees working there kept getting interrupted by the same caller for twenty minutes and eight failed attempts to reach out to them.

I was looking around on ""global garage sale internet place"" and saw a really nice plastic Brachiosaurus toy for very cheap.  I was the only bidder and won the bid, and that was that for a while.  

Time passes, and the package eventually arrives (the item shipped from overseas), and I go to open it.  It doesn't feel like a dinosaur's inside.  When I open it, my suspicions are confirmed, and I am instantly confused.  

Because what was inside the package was not a Brachiosaurus.

It was not even a dinosaur.  

It was not even an animal.  

It wasn't even a single-piece toy fill-in-the-blank.  

It was, drum roll please, an unbranded knock-off of the major brand of little plastic blocks you stick together to make things.  A kit for, again, not even a dinosaur or an animal, but for a jewelry store.  With ""jewelry"" misspelled.  

I just stared at the bags of pieces and instructions for a while in said confusion, and went to message the seller to get a refund.  I explained that I had ordered a plastic Brachiosaurus figure and had instead received a brick kit for a jewelry store.  They replied along the lines of ""When things like this happen, we recommend looking at the picture of the item you ordered, to make sure that you remember what it is you got and to check that it is the same.""

I wasn't feeling like playing games, so I attached pictures of the pieces and assembly instructions, mentioning that what I got looks nothing at all like the dinosaur in the item photo.  After that, they gave me an apology and a refund.  

I know that it's sometimes a gamble from online sellers, yes, but I've ordered lots of dinosaurs from similar places, and even when the order got messed up a little, it was still a dinosaur.  The particular seller in question had pretty good reviews as well.  It just cracks me up and confounds me still that I expected a long-necked dinosaur and instead found a pile of bricks to build a tiny jewelry shop.

Today we went during happy hour which was about 7 dollars cheaper. Happy hour started at 9 and the restaurant closes at 11. We intentionally waited outside so we would be there exactly at happy hour. We entered the restaurant and still waited an additional 5 minutes. 

The service during the meal was great for the most part. Our waiter was attentive and put in our orders even when we reached our max of five items for the moment. 

It's the end of our meal and we get the check. One friend decides to pay in cash. I pay for my boyfriend on a card and the other couple also pay on a card. It took us awhile to figure out the math but we got it settled and pay after explaining how we want the check split. 

We get the receipts when one of the guys says ""wait I think they are charging us the full amount not the happy hour amount, no wonder we couldn't figure it out"" 
We decide it's fine to pay the full amount and just not tip because that can be the tip. We make sure to get our waiter to let them know what happened and that they should just adjust the amount they charged us as opposed to voiding the whole transaction and doing it again. 

We tell our waiter that they charged us the full amount instead of happy hour. She seems confused. ""Well what time did you get here? Are you sure you did happy hour and didn't order stuff not on happy hour(which was only 3 items not included)?"" We say yes we are sure. 

She eventually accepts it and walks away. As we leave she's decided to void the whole thing and start again. No big deal, we like eating here and don't want to ruin a good restaurant.  As she's charging our cards again she happens to tell us that sometimes they charge happy hour and sometimes they charge the regular price and just don't care. 

That doesn't seem like the best thing to tell a customer but now we know to look at the pricing, especially during happy hour. ",1,Kbbq happy hour prices only when they remember,30

I had left my tote in the car and didn't grab a cart or basket and had a handful of items (I only went in for one thing...) and so not wanting to drop any I grabbed an empty box off of a cart a worker was using to stock the shelves in that aisle.

She was displeased. She said it was not proper for me to take the box as they collect all the empty boxes and bale them up and sell the bales. Thus, I was costing them money.

But I was holding about $30 worth of items and had taken a box that was worth maybe three cents, if that. Shouldn't the money I was about to spend, then and later, be more important than a worthless box?

Bro: my brother, E: employee, and me as me, conversations are approximate, as this happened a while ago

My mom, bro (about 7 y/o) and I (about 12 y/o) went to the store to buy some groceries. After shopping around for a while, my mom decides to let my bro and I go down the snack aisle to get some chips/crackers or whatever.

We both head off in the other direction, but there are two employees stocking the shelves near the entrance of the aisle, both probably middle aged (about 50, I'd say). 

Now maybe I was just being lazy, or... no, I really can't think of any other excuses. I just didn't feel like walking down the aisle.

Me: Hey (insert short nickname), want to run and get Cheez-Its or something?

Bro: Sure. (He actually was pretty eager to go get them, as our mom is really nice, but tends to be a little protective when it comes to just about anything. Letting us loose in a store was kind of cool to him)

E: (After my brother started walking away) He's your kid? (Goes back to restocking shelf)

Me: Um...no... (A little shocked by the question, not to mention I hate being confronted) 

E: Oh? He isn't?

Me: (I just kind of shook my head no, held my breath hoping bro would come back and managed to mumble out the word ""brother"")

The awkward in the air could have choked a horse. 

My bro came back with Cheez-Its, and I made sure to call him ""bro"" as we walked away. We went back to find my mom, and had a good laugh about it on the car ride back. No harm done, although I hope it didn't make the employee feel too embarrassed. Or his coworker next to him (who stayed silent the whole time).

Bro and I are only five years apart, and I didn't look old for my age. It would have been silly to assume that I could have had a kid at 12 (although I understand it does happen, sadly), let alone have a child at 5.

Maybe my flaw was asking my bro to get some chips and then waiting for him. And the employee probably wasn't paying close attention, can't really blame him I guess.

The staff mainly consisted of two guys which seem to do crazy shifts, because most of the times I have been there it would be one of them there and the place had at least 18 hours open 6 days of the week. They were very friendly and competent.

Recently the place good renovated (maybe a new owner?). The first time I got there after the renovation, there where two new guys manning the burger place simultaneously. Early evening time, nothing special. 

I order burgers and fries for me and my girlfriend, to go, like usual and they make them. One of the guys puts the little bag with burgers on the counter and as I approach he says to me

""If you want mayonnaise or ketchup on the fries you have to order them""

This seems rather rational at first put let me give you a picture of the situation. These items are free. He and his college work in a shoebox of a burger joint. He literally just has to move his arm to the tray where these items lay. 

In the meantime a group of teenagers arrived and currently order their meals. I go behind them to order my extras after they finished.

One minute in the guy with the bag again shouts in my direction, everything is very loud so approach him again to understand what he says, he repeats

""If you want mayonnaise or ketchup on the fries you have to order them!"" 

Now loud and as if I am to dumb to comply. I answer loudly

""I know!""

And to this comment the other guy which takes the orders gives me a big grin, takes some packages of mayonnaise and ketchup and without any comment just put them in the bag which still rests on the counter.

I took the bag and went home, the patties had black burns and there was so much sauce on the burgers that they became a soggy mess by the time we tried to eat them.

TL:DR at bottom

2 nights ago my husband and I and our 3 kids went to a chain steak place for dinner.  This place does not take reservations &amp; never has.  A few years back it would let you call in and get a place on the wait list but it stopped doing that a year or so ago.  Now you just show up and take your chances with everyone else.

So we showed up at 6:30ish and were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait or so.  Fine.  Tables for 5 always take longer because there are generally fewer of them. We are used to this.  There were 7-8 names ahead of us on the list &amp; a crowd of about 20 people waiting.

We were debating eating in the bar if a table opened up when a group of 6 rolls in - a couple about my age (50s) and some other adults (I am lousy at guessing ages).  Older Guy (OG) goes up to the hostess stand.  I don't hear the start of it but I guess he said he had a reservation for 6 and they said they don't take reservations because he immediately raised his voice shouting that he had a reservation and demanding they be seated now!  His party are just mostly just standing there. One of them is trying to placate the guy that it's no big deal to wait and another is supporting him demanding a manager.

Manager comes out &amp; is trying to calm OG and OG is going off about terrible customer service &amp; he called ahead &amp; just generally going off on the manager, who is trying to explain they don't take call aheads anymore and haven't in some time, but OG is not having it &amp; is demanding he be seated now. I turn to my husband and mutter ""if they seat this asshole ahead of us this scene will be nothing to the one I make.""

Sure enough the manager caves and says ""Fine sir, as a good will gesture we will give you the first table that opens up.""

And a hero arose from the multitude

""THE HELL YOU WILL!"" shouted this guy (HERO) on the other side of the waiting area. ""If being a prick gets you seated faster I can be a bigger prick.""  ""Damn straight! We were all here before him!""  I stick my oar in.  OG tells us to stay the hell out of it and HERO wasn't having it.  They start arguing.  Myself and other customers waiting chime in.  Hostesses are hiding behind the stand.  Waiters are hovering. Diners are staring. Near riot at the steak place.

Manager eventually says he isn't seating OG's party ahead of anyone else and asks them to leave.  OG's group pretty much drag him out. HERO apologizes to everyone for the scene.  I ask the manager for his GM's contact info &amp; business cards are passed out to all of us.  I thank HERO for saying something.  The evening proceeds as originally planned.

Aftermath:  When we got home I sent off an email to the GM and to corporate describing situation and asking if giving in to bullies was company policy.  I received an email from corporate apologizing for the incident &amp; talking about 'de-escalation techniques' (which made it sound very much as if giving in to bullies is actually company policy) and giving me some gift cards.  The GM called me yesterday evening, saying he was very sorry the situation was handled the way it was.  I mentioned these de-escalation techniques corporate told me about; how it sounds like if I just shout loud enough I'll get seated next even if I am in the wrong and how it clearly backfired the previous evening.  We had a nice chat.  I was given more gift cards.  The manager will apparently be given some more de-escalation training.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - entitled customer demands to be seated immediately, ahead of 7-8 parties already waiting, manager is about to give in when a hero arises to put a stop to it.

This happened between me, a federal government mailing service, and a globally known online retailer named for a big rainforest in brazil, who recently started their own shipping service.

&amp;#x200B;

I order online a lot and its not unusual for me to forget the delivery times estimated, and be surprised by packages when coming home from work. This time, i see a little pink slip on my door, saying that there was a failed delivery. I look at the slip, and see that the package was not delivered due to ""funds due on postage in the amount of $3.66."" Very confused, as i pay postage before shipping, and never have seen this in my life, i forget about it until i get to work the next morning and can sit down and scan the barcode tracking number at the bottom of my slip to see what the problem was. Of course the barcode failed to find my package, and sent me straight to customer service. After waiting on the phone for 45 min, they tell me i must call my local office branch.

&amp;#x200B;

Great... i call the local office, and the woman on the other end CLEARLY has this job simply for the paycheck. You can hear the attitude and snark, and the 'I clearly don't want to be here' attitude, that comes from knowing being fired is a very unlikely scenario. She asks for my info, and quickly finds my package, a small envelope less than 1 lb. (for background, the package i found out later was for $9.35 worth of command strips, to hang wall pictures with). She says that the package has postage due on it. I knew that, but what was odd, was the tracking number she gave me. It was not one i recognize. I should mention here that i work in shipping, closely working with most large shipping carriers, and can recognize the company that shipped out the package by the number most times. This number was not one i actually recognize, and for sure was not the shipping carrier i was ""owing"" money too. I asked what carrier had shipped my package. She says that in fact it was the big online retailers new shipping service, and that the office i was on the phone with had nothing to do with the shipping or handling of this package...

&amp;#x200B;

How did it get to the mean woman's office? Well, apparently the package was delivered into my mailbox, and marked down as delivered. Case closed, right? Nope. The federal shipping service goes into my mail box, sees that there is a package, and either accidentally (since i honestly don't know if it was a legit mistake or not, maybe he thought i was returning the parcel) or on purpose, took my package. Then to add insult to injury, said that money was due to get my package back. The woman I was talking to on the phone said ""well, there was postage due on this. We will give it to you if you come PICK IT UP"" (local office pretty far away) and pay the $3.66 on the package i had already paid shipping for. She kept reiterating that i would not be able to even look at the package until the payment was made. The amount of money isn't the point here. I was pissed, since the $3.66 is almost half of the price of the stupid items in the first place. I stayed on the phone with the lady, trying to understand how they could take my package and ransom it to me, and trying to make her understand how ridiculous it sounded.

&amp;#x200B;

I hung up on her, fuming and immediately called customer service for the big online store. I will never forget this call. As some of you probably know, customer service reps are trained to answer literally any question, and often times have a script of what to say for each question with poise and grace. I explain everything that happened so far, and the wonderful service rep goes dead silent. I will never forget what his next word was. After a long-ish pause, i simply hear, ""What......?"" He was stumped. He had no idea what to say, which at least made me feel a lot better, and that i wasn't crazy. He transfered me to a higher up who helped send me new command strips next day air, saying how sorry she was that this had happened, and she would be escalating this case to ensure it doesn't happen again to anyone, which is all i ask. She also tells me to not pay the fine and ignore the package still in limbo at the shipping office. Duh. i just wish that the federal office could be at least reprimanded, but they seem to have gotten away with ransom.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on holiday overseas a few weeks ago and wanted to turn on my international roaming. However, I couldn't get it to work because there were some issues with the settings on my phone. Not wanting a massive phone bill for being on hold while waiting for technical support, I decided to turn to my phone company's Twitter account. After tweeting them my problem, I was surprised by the quick response from the company, as well as the number of responses from other customers.

I found this really heartwarming because gone were the days of waiting endlessly for that one technical support staff to answer my question, but rather a whole community willing to lend a hand. The huge number of helpful responses from the customer commiunity on Twitter also meant that it was easy to find the solution to my problem.

So when I go out to places I try to go alone so that I don't get mistaken for someone else's kid. (I have gotten mistaken for my older sister's kid.)

A few times when I've gone into restaurants, either in front of or behind a large group of people, I get mistaken for one of the group. It's usually not that big of a deal considering I can usually catch the host before they leave and quickly tell them that I came alone so they can sit me at a single table while the bigger group waits for something else to open up.

Only twice has this not really worked, but only once was it pretty upsetting.

The first time the group was pretty big and the entrance area was pretty small so when they told the host how many there were I couldn't really push past them to tell him I wasn't with them. I tried to sit at one of the benches to separate myself from the group, but this group seemed pretty chummy and so some of them just squished in next to me. I tried to stand as far away from the group as I could while still trying to get the Host's attention, but I think he just thought I was an inpatient party member and ignored me. Eventually a passing Waitress noticed me and asked about it and I told her I wasn't a part of the group. She in turn told the Host and I was seated fairly quickly. He was pretty apologetic about it and I had only really been there for ten minutes at the time so it didn't bother me.

The second time however.

Again I had walked in behind a pretty normal sized group, maybe six or seven people, but the problem with this place is they didn't really seem to have someone at the front. The only person near the front seemed to be someone taking to go and delivery orders. The group and I saw Waiters and Bussers in the back sort of poking their heads out to look at us, but not taking the time to greet us. 

The place wasn't packed per se, but there were only a handful of tables available and the all seemed to be in separate corners. I tried to wave down a Waiter (they could clearly see us), but none of them came up to us. Also note that the entrance area was pretty big and I wasn't standing anywhere near the group. Eventually a Busser noticed me and seem to ask one of the Waitresses something. The Waitress finally came up to us and asked,

""Are you with them?""

I said no, but then the Waitress replied,

""Well why didn't you say so?""

??? Maybe because no one was at the front and all of you had been ignoring us until now??? Apparently seeing the size of the group they realized none of the non-occupied tables could fit them and so they just decided to wait until one was free to seat them. Okay but, why not greet us first so that we weren't all just standing around with no direction? What if the group had other people coming in and needed an even bigger space? What if all of us were separate customers who all happened upon the restaurant at the same time?

I did get seated right after, but the way the Waitress spoke to me along the way made me feel like she was treating me like a silly child. As if I couldn't raise my voice when I needed to. Not realizing that if I had gone back there and pulled someone out to serve us I could be deemed impatient. As if I hadn't been patiently waiting for 25 minutes just standing there. (I didn't drive there I took the bus, so I couldn't just leave without having to wait another hour for a bus to come pick me up.)

Hot dogs, when done properly, can be really good and can be more than just something that he eat from a sidewalk vendor or at a backyard BBQ.  Because of this, we were excited when a new hot dog restaurant opened near our house.  

We went to it one Saturday morning for lunch.  We were the first customers of the day and walked up to the counter.  We reviewed the menu and then made our order.  We ordered a corn dog, two Chicago-style dogs, a Eurodog (had roumalade sauce on it), a corn dog, and some fries.  The lady at the register made repeated mistakes with our order; we had to repeat everything three or four times.  She finally got it right, we paid, and then we went and sat to wait.

Several minutes later our order is brought out.  The order only had one Chicago-style hot dog and also had a chili dog that we didn't order.  The waitress took the chili dog back, apologized, and said that the missing Chicago-style dog would be right out.  We then started eating the food that we had ordered while we waited on the missing hot dog.

The owner immediately came out of the kitchen, looked at our table, and just glared at us and got redder and redder in the face.  During his glarefest, my wife picked up the Eurodog and started eating it.  The owner then yelled out ""OH, YOU""RE GOING TO EAT THE EURODOG YOU DIDN'T ORDER?!!!"" and started running towards us so that he could grab it out of her mouth and hit her.  Right before he got to us I told him ""No, we ordered the Eurodog, but mistakenly got a chili dog instead of a Chicago dog.""  

He then stopped, about one foot from our table, mumbled ""I'm sorry"" and ran back into the kitchen.  His arm was cocked to hit my wife when he came to his abrupt stop and he had sprinted about 30 feet towards us; he looked like he was going to punch, grab, or tackle my wife.  

My wife and I just looked at each other with a did-that-really-happen look.  

We ended up getting the missing Chicago-style dog and finishing our meal.  The food was horrible and the owner stayed in the kitchen until we left, although we could see him glaring at us through the door.

I posted a review on Yelp about the food and the wonderful interaction with the owner.  He ended up creating several accounts to badmouth me and accuse me of lying.  

The restaurant ended up only staying open about 6 weeks before it closed.  ",1,Crazed restaurant owner attacks my wife and I over a hot dog,1881

LTL, FTP, excuse formatting, sorry so long, today is my cake day, etc. This happened yesterday and I'm still angry, trying to decide whether to contact a GM or leave a negative review.

Background - In January there was a terrible snowstorm. My car does not do well in snow, so I decided to buy a set of snow tires from \[tire store\]. My tires use a sensor to communicate information to the dashboard, and the new snow tires would not work without these sensors. The salesman said it would be cost $65 each time to swap sensors from one set of the tires to the other set, or he could sell me a new set of aftermarket sensors for $120 so that both sets of tires would have their own set of sensors. $120 once sounded like a better deal than $65 per tire swap, so I bought the second set of sensors. My experience in January was great, snow tires were great, sensors were great, etc.

Yesterday - The weather has been warmer for a couple of weeks, so I decided it was time to swap the snow tires back to road tires. I go into the same \[tire store\], drop off my car, and was told to expect my car to be finished in \~3 hours. (No problem, my office is literally across the street.) 3 hours later I get a phone call from \[Tire Store\].

ME = Me, TS = Tire Store Employee

TS: We were swapping your tires over and noticed your road tires don't have any sensors. Would you like to buy a new set for $120 or have us swap them over for $65?

ME: Hold on, I bought these tires from you less than three months ago. When I came in I already purchased a second set of sensors so both tires would have their own set.

TS: Well that's funny, only your snow tires have sensors in them. Do you want to buy a second set now?

ME: No, I want to figure out why only my snow tires have sensors right now. I should have eight sensors total.

TS: Let me put you on hold for a minute.

\*\*10 minutes later\*\*

TS: Okay, I can see that you did purchase a second set of sensors from us back in January. I'll go ahead and throw in a free set of sensors for you today and we'll call it good.

ME: First, I already bought a second set of sensors from \[Tire Store\] that I apparently never received. Second, my biggest concern right now is what \[Tire Store\] actually did last time I took my car in. Did an employee misplace my original sensors? Did \[Tire Store\] ever perform the service I paid for? Did an employee steal my original sensors?

TS: Well all I can do is make sure that both sets of tires have sensors after this visit.

ME: That still doesn't satisfy my concern with the service I have received from \[Tire Store\]. I want to get this figured out. Can you find out if the original or aftermarket sensors are currently in the snow tires?

\*\*Some grumbling, excuses, and a brief hold\*\*

TS: Okay, we can check which sensors are in your snow tires and install a new set of sensors into your road tires.

I end the call after verifying my car would still be ready before the end of the day, with a full set of sensors for each set of tires.

\*\*Fast forward to me picking up my car\*\*

TS: It's funny, I don't know how it happened - your snow tires had two original sensors and two aftermarket sensors.

ME: Thank you for checking that. That tells us exactly what happened to the old sensors. I appreciate you making things right this time.

I didn't elaborate to the employee what I meant by ""exactly what happened” but having two sensors from two different sets it seems clear to me that someone intentionally mixed the sets in order to steal a complete set for themselves. The tire swap was already free before this mess, so I wasn't out any money here. I ended with a set of sensors for each set of tires, so I \[finally\] received what I paid for back in January. I hadn't known that the sensors were missing until yesterday, so I never had any issues until yesterday.

I'm still angry for originally being charged on a product/service that I did not receive. If I had taken my car to a different \[Tire Store\], or if my wife had attempted to take the car anywhere, I believe the outcome would have been much worse.

Thoughts? Should I post a negative review? Should I contact a GM?  


TL:DR - I bought new snow tires and new sensors.  A \[Tire Store\] employee allegedly pocketed 2 of my original and 2 of my new sensors, then put the other 2 original and 2 new sensors in my new snow tires, and left my street tires with no sensors.  I didn't find out until I went in to swap the snow tires back to the street tires.",1,The Tale of the Missing Sensors,10

I'm out with mom shopping, and close to the end of the day I get a fever and start feeling very bad. We are over an hour away from home so we get some pills from the pharmacy and go to a café to drink something hot.

Characters are Mom, Me, Our Waiter, Different Waiter, Bartender Girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Our Waiter: Hello, what can I get you?

Me: I'd like an apple-cinnamon tea, please.

Our Waiter: We don't have that, we only have some fancy teas that are supposedly something great but they're nothing special really.

I proceed to look at the tea brochure and pick one.

Me: Then I'll have raspberry. *(It was listed as raspberry-hibiscus.)*

Mom: I'll have rosehip tea, please.

Our Waiter: Okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Three minutes later, Different Waiter comes. Mom is now talking on the phone, I'm hunched with my head leaned on my hand. Different Waiter leans down to me saying: I brought you both the same tea because we didn't have... *quiet mumble quiet mumble.*

My mind understood this as him bringing the same, fancy brand of tea because they didn't have the rosehip tea from the usual brand that everyone sells. But I didn't really understand him much and that was my mom's order and not mine so I didn't say anything. I did think it weird that they didn't come over saying, hey, we don't have that, but instead they simply brought something else anyway. I'd also assume they should be able to remember those 10 tea types that they have available. It's not that hard. But whatever.

He went away, I put my tea bag in the hot water and mom did the same. I told her that he mumbled something about bringing us both the same because they didn't have something. Since he was unclear, we just shrugged it off. Only when my mom put her tea bag in the water and the smell of rasberry spread, did we realize he meant he literally brought us the exact same tea. Both of the waiters were nowhere to be seen and it was a tiny open space café where you can see everything from wherever you are. So mom went to the bar.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: Excuse me. I didn't order this.

Bartender Girl: Sorry, you're gonna have to deal with your waiter for that.

Mom: He's not here. Don't you have rosehip tea? That's what I ordered but I got rasberry instead.

Bartender Girl: Nope. Yeah, he probably brought you that because it's a combination of raspberry-hibiscus. We only have it like that.

Mom: But I clearly asked for rosehip, not any kind of combination with raspberry. If you can't give me the tea I ordered, I'd like a cappuccino.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom comes back to our table annoyed that the girl was so uninterested. Our Waiter appears and cleans the table next to ours.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom tells him: Excuse me, your colleague brought me something I didn't order.

Our Waiter: Nothing I can do about it.

Mom: How do you mean? You brought me the wrong thing.

Our Waiter: You already opened the bag. You should pay attention to what you order.

Mom: I know what I ordered! I assume it is the right thing when you bring it.

Our Waiter: I have to pay for it out of my own pocket. You should have looked at what you got first.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom is too annoyed with his wanna-fight attitude and gives up. A minute later he's by our table again.

&amp;#x200B;

Our Waiter: You ordered this as well. *Puts down a cappuccino*.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom is now pissy because she did not order that AS WELL, she ordered it instead since they couldn't provide what we ordered and brought the wrong thing expecting us to simply accept it. The Different Waiter passes by.

Mom: Sorry, earlier you brougt us a tea we didn't order.

Different Waiter: *Clearly looking pissy.* Nothing I can do about it. We don't have rosehip on its own. S*ighs loudly and rolls eyes.*

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes later, Different Waiter is talking to the table behind me. I hear a lady say ""I did not order that"". He comes to our table asking if we ordered ice-cream. We say we didn't. He rolls eyes. He seems profoundly confused as he looks around to see who might have ordered ice-cream. There were only 3 tables occuppied in the whole café including mom and me. It must have been Casper playing tricks on him.

When the bill arrived, surprisingly there was no cappuccino but there were both the teas. The price was through the roof. Never in my life have I drunk such an expensive tea served by such impolite, unconcentrated, pissy staff.

The café used to be a very busy place where you had to wait ten - fifteen minutes to get a table. We were surprised to find only two tables when we arrived. It was soon clear why it is so.",1,"If you don't have what we ordered, say so, instead of bringing whatever substitute you think is okay.",684

This is not my first post, but I am on mobile, sorry! Also, English is my second language so please excuse any grammatical errors I may make. 

I’ll keep it short and sweet.

This past Monday morning I lost my wallet on the train while I was on my way to college. I actually didn’t realize my wallet wasn’t in my bag until I tried to buy something at the student store. I put my items back and apologized but I couldn’t even be embarrassed since I was too busy freaking tf out. 

You see, smart woman I apparently am not.

I had my IDs, my medical card, my credit and debit card, among another random assortment of cards, 92$ in cash, AND MY GOD DAMN SSN CARD.

I know. I am aware that I am an idiot.

But in my defense I was actually using my ssn card and stuff to fill out some documents at school. I just forgot to take it out of my wallet....

Well cue me freaking out and randomly crying for 2 days straight, frantically calling the banks, the fraud department (I think I called Experian), contacting train staff to open a lost and found case thing, etc. You get the point. 

And I looked EVERYWHERE. No stone was left unturned. More specifically, I went to all the places I had been that morning. Including a certain shop that we will call “Trinana Coffee.” I’m sure you’ll never be able to guess what it is, lol. 

Anyways, if I am being honest I was a complete wreck. Bless the lovely staff at this specific Trinana location. They were so helpful I literally cannot be any more thankful. Especially the manager working at the time. He took the time to listen to my concerns, took the time to check the cameras for me, and did whatever was within his power. 

Unfortunately yeah I left my wallet on a train not anywhere else, so I didn’t get it back until.. well, today. But I did not forget how helpful those Trinana staff were, especially the manager dude.

I had promised myself if I ever saw my stuff again I’d go leave a good tip and tip the manager dude separately. I was very surprised to have found my wallet intact, money included. So I left the manager a $20 tip and allll my thanks lol. I left a normal tip too, I just wish I could have done more.. it’s just too bad I’m a broke ass student though. 

But honestly, that’s the best customer service I’ve had in a while and I though I’d share how awesome the staff were. And yeah, that’s it. Sorry if it isn’t all too interesting, but I hope y’all enjoyed it at least a little. ",1,I lost my wallet the other day.,9

So today me and my husband decided to order pizza for dinner. The pizza place is not far from our house, 1 or 2 minutes by car or 5 minutes walking. You don't have to pay for delivery but they only give you certain deals if you pick the pizzas yourself.

The deal we always use is the buy one get one free on large pizzas with 4+ ingredients. We always call ahead, make our order and then pick it up fifteen to twenty minutes later. But on wednesdays they have other deal, 50% off when you order large pizzas with 4+ingredients, and they give you this deal even if you order it to your house.

Today being wednesday, and because we were just tired and in no mood to cook or get out of the house we called to order two large pizzas. With the 50% off we would only pay for one and they would deliver it to our house.

I called the pizza place and made my order but in the end the price didn't quite add up, so once again I told the guy about the Wednesday deal and asked for my 50% off. He told me he had already made the discount and I insisted he was wrong and asked him if the prices had gone up. He said no so once more I explained the check wasn't right, I always pay about 22€ for the two large pizzas with the get one free, and today was 50% off at the end total price, so I had to pay the same.

This guy proceeded to try teaching me basic math (bear in mind I'm an engineer, I studied advanced mathematics) telling me 50% off at the end total price of the exactly same two pizzas wasn't the same thing as getting one free when you bought another. I couldn't believe what I heard...10 minutes into the phone call and my order still hadn't gone through.

I asked him if he could put someone else on the phone, he said no, and said he had more calls to answer and couldn't lose more time with me...""listen, this is the price, if you don't agree with it I'm going to hang up"" and he did.

I couldn't believe what the hell was happening...I put my shoes on and walked to the pizza place, when I got there I recognized his voice and called him out, he immediately told me ""it's not my fault you don't know math"", his manager heard and came to see what was going on, she couldn't believe it herself and told him how dumb he was and apologized to me.

I ended up getting one big bottle of coke, two garlic and cheese breads, and two haagen dazs ice creams for free. ",1,Cashier doesn't know basic math,471

This is a experience of my time working customer service for an event management company. This company handled customer service and security for concerts and sporting events. In particular a NFL team in northeast Florida.

In my two years there, I've witnessed things that are downright unbelievable. Just to name a few: fights, drunks, entitled parent/people and so on. Some straight Florida man level shit.

This story happened about two years ago and I remember the events, very well.  This was the second time events of the storyhas happened to me. The first time being when I saw this band years earlier.

Background

The important thing here is that I'm sensitive to bright light. I found this out the first time I saw the band, the Deftones; important to the story.


The story


I was scheduled to work a concert at the local amphitheater. I had no idea who was playing, until I got there. Low and behold, the Deftones are one of the opening acts. My mind went back to the first time I saw them, no good.

I figured as long as I'm not in the bowl, I would be ok. Well I was placed in the bowl and my request to be moved was denied. I was told ""tell the supervisor to cut me before that band goes on.""

I feel that I have to point out that this company is totally incompetent, on a good day.

I arrive and inform my supervisor about my  condition and needing to leave early. The response was typical of the company, he scoffs at me and says ""we'll see"". Seeing where this is going, I text my roommate (who is working the same event, as security) that we maybe leaving early.

The show begins and all is good for the first two acts. Now I was positioned on the concourse level (2nd level)  looking down at the stage and getting the full exposure to the stage lights. The Deftones go on and I still haven't been cut.

Ten minutes in and I'm already feeling the effects of the lights. (Watch videos of their lives shows and you will understand) 20 minutes in I'm holding on to the railing to keep upright. Guest are starting to notice that I'm not well. Some come and check to make sure I'm all right.  One buys me a Gatorade, that I can't accept, but wouldn't take no for an answer.

Finally, someone goes to get security. This is at 30 minutes in. Apparently I had gone pale and struggling to stay on my feet. The guest and security get to me ; upon seeing the state I was in, EMTs and the supervisors are called to my section.

I declined the hospital trip, cause I knew I'll be ok once I got away from the lights. They finally cut me 15 minutes before the band goes off stage.(now about 45 minutes into the performance) I have to be helped down the stairs, bad idea should have used the elevator. I'm disoriented, dizzy and here comes my dinner. Vomiting over the railing and onto passer-bys below.

They finally gotten me to the back and paged my roommate, to take me home.  Being away from the lights, I was finally feeling better, but hungry. It was while I was waiting for my roommate that I heard about the mess that I caused.

The supervisor had been chewed out by higher ups, EMTs and guest. I had thrown up on about five people. Which got free tickets to the show of their choice. In general made the company look like the idiots they were.

They didn't book me for any events for two weeks after. I stayed with the company for another year before I moved, for a better paying job in another city. I have many more stories from this company. Two years working for them i saw plenty. Including my roommate having a similar situation as me at a football game.

I went to a gas station and decided to buy a drink and a candy bar late at night.

I go to the counter and the guy is sitting down, which isnt a bad thing, he wasn’t reading or looking at his phone or anything so I just sit my stuff down and the guy just looks at me.

After about 20 seconds of him just looking, I say “could you help?” And he rolls his eyes and gets up. Already this kind of annoyed me, but it got worse.

He scans my items, and since I’m paying with card I wait for him to say “you can insert your card now” like every other place ever has done. But he dosent do it, I just stand there for 30 seconds waiting for him to say something but eventually I say “should I insert my card now?” And he goes “if your paying with a card, then yes”

I had been holding my card through the whole transaction.

Finally the part that made me post this, he starts to walk back to his seat and when I ask for a bag, he takes a bag puts the drink in, and puts the candy bar in. The drink is on the edge of the counter on his side, and the candy bar is literally hanging off his edge entirely, only being held up by the bag and the drink.

He then goes back to sit down, without saying anything. I reach over and take my bag, and walk out. I get that it was pretty late at night but still, this was really weird to me. I bet I could have walked out with anything if I wanted to steal something, and he wouldn’t have seen or cared.

So this happened a couple years ago, but we had such bad service, we’ve never been back. 

It was a friend’s birthday and a bunch of us met at this local steak house. Everyone ordered and everything was going fine until we got our food. One of my friends ordered a steak, rare. It was obviously overdone, so they called the waiter over and they obliged and cooked a new one. 

So the second steak arrives, the rest of us have half finished our meals, and their steak is overdone again. My friend is very picky about their steak and when they say rare, they mean rare, practically still mooing. They call the waiter over again, the waiter obliges again, no fuss, but runs into one of the owners on the way to the kitchen. 

The owner brings the plate back to my friend and shines a PEN LIGHT on it (place was a little dark, but we could all still see) to prove it wasn’t overdone and then refused to send it back for another remake. 

My friend then eats only fried onions and a salad from before the main course. Now we’re all a little po’d. We go to pay and they still want to charge us for the steak that she didn’t eat.

&amp;#x200B;

The week before Christmas I had all of my shopping done except for my mom. I couldn't figure out anything to get her and she wasn't being helpful, so I decided to get her something from one of those engraving places at the mall. They're super busy of course, but I'm patient. The cashier tells me they're way behind on orders and my item probably won't be done until a day or two before Christmas. I don't really want to deal with the mall again, but I have no other ideas for a gift and I wasn't doing anything those days, so I figured why not.

&amp;#x200B;

I get a call on the 23rd that my item will be ready tomorrow (Christmas-Eve) by 2pm. Ok, great!

&amp;#x200B;

Next day I get ready and prepare myself mentally to deal with the crowds. Of course the parking lot is PACKED. The main part of the lot is bumper to bumper, so I decide to go to one of the side areas hoping it'll be a little emptier. I noticed one   
 guy heading to his car, so I start to follow him. He tells me ""I'm that dark blue car there on the end."" It's 3 lanes up and on the corner closest to me, so I would have to do a sort of U-turn to get into the spot. I pull up and put my blinker on, but leaving room in my main aisle for people to pass by.

&amp;#x200B;

When the guy gets in his car, I noticed a woman probably in her late 50s or early 60s put her blinker on signaling she's going after that spot. I wave to get her attention and sign that I'm already waiting for it. She smiles at me and shakes her head and signs that *she's* getting that spot. I get ready for a race and position my car closer, leaving the guy plenty of room to back out. Luckily, as he backs out he maneuver's in a way that blocks to lady and leaves me wide open to park, and I do so. I felt kinda bad for taking a spot from an older lady, but hey, I was there first.

She is *fuming* at this point and pulls up next to me in the main aisle and rolls her window down.

Lady: ""I've been driving around for TWO HOURS looking for a spot!""

While surfing through my puter tonight i stumbled on a story i wrote several years ago..

In 2003, after living in Virginia for a while, I decided to fly back home to Canada. And I chose to fly United Airlines.

Big mistake

Huge mistake

COLOSSAL MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!

Btw did I mention it was a big mistake? &lt;twitch&gt;

I purchased my tickets in Norfolk and was told that the route I was taking would involve two plane changes. No problem says I. And the universe laughed. FOOL!

On the day I was to fly I packed my little suitcase and headed to the airport in Norfolk VA. When I got to the check in counter I was met by cute chicky poo with a bright smile - and absolutely no understanding or ability to speak English. As soon as I opened my mouth, her 1000 megawatt smile faltered slightly and her eyes took on the glazed panicked look of a deer approaching oncoming traffic.

“ I am going to Canada.:” says I. “ will I need to check my bag through customs at any point between here and Halifax nova Scotia?” Girlie bobbed her head like a marionette on a string and smiled even more brightly and more vacantly and said “No only go Halifax! You luggage fine! You fine! You go now! Bye-bye!” and flapped her hand like granny from the Beverley hillbillies. I looked at her in bemused puzzlement while scratching my head and as she continued to bob and smile I shrugged and made my way through the gate and eventually onto the 1st leg of the ride from Hades.

It wasn’t until I actually saw the 1st plane I was to fly in, that I began to feel the first tingling of the doom that was to come for instead of a sleek modern flying machine, I instead faced something that looked like it had escaped the raiders of the lost ark museum! The seats were small, and leaned sadly to one side or the other, the patched and thread bare carpet gleamed through the dust and the flight attendants looked like un-rehabilitated guards from San Quinton! As I stood in the doorway trembling with fear, one of the guards- erm attendants - stomped over and bellowed “SIT!” “yes mam!” squeaked I and sat while the rest of the prisoners - erm passengers- came aboard. Now I am not a seasoned traveler by any means but it does seem to me that one is supposed to get more than water on a flight. After we took off, our attendant came marching down the aisle with her arms full of tiny 4 oz bottles of water. Without pausing she began to throw them one at a time in the general vicinity of peoples bodies. “HERE CATCH!”. Those of us that caught a bottle were rewarded with a smile that would make strong men weep and tremble with fear!

My next stop was Washington DC, where we were let off at the back of the airport in the middle of a runway. Clutching my bottle of water, I gamely followed the attendant down the steps of the plane and across the tarmac and up some broken wooden steps into the back of the airport. As I looked around at the broken chairs, and mud covered floor, I was stunned to see a clone of the counter girl from Norfolk standing at a podium that looked like it had escaped a high school graduation from the 1950s! Sidling up to her I showed her my ticket and asked her “Where do I go from here?” After staring at my ticket for a full minute she nodded her head like a puppet on a stick and chirped “ you go three doors!” and held up 3 fingers “onnnnnnnnnnnne twoooooooooooo threeeeeeeeee! dat way! Byebye!” ” and bobbling her head some more and pointing down a long dark hallway with single flickering fluorescent light running down the middle of it! As I stumbled along, I was joined by guy also looking for his plane. So we wandered down the hallway together like some sort of traveling zombies mumbling “Terminal A must find terminal A”

Flight number two was in a plane much bigger than the one from Norfolk and I foolishly thought that it would be better. And again the universe laughed at me and yelled FOOL! My seat mate was a tiny old lady who was looking kind of frazzled and worn out. Her husband was sitting across the ailse looking like he had been through the bore war and been spat out the other end ! We started talking and I asked her where she was going and she said “ Honey chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiileeee mah husband and I live in Raleigh North Caroliiiiiinaaaaaaaa. We been travelin United for four days now an we only got 2 houuurrrrrrrrrrrs from home! We was wanting to go to England but we don’t care no more! SARS or no SARS we is stayyyyyyin in Toronto!” Just as she said that the attendants came along with snacks! Snacks I thought! Actual snacks! Real snacks! And stared happily at my 2 oz Dixie cup of warm apple juice and 3 oz bag of gold fish crackers. I was going to save my crackers for later but then glanced over at the ladies husband. He had his tray down and was hunched over it munching those crackers for all he was worth while eyeballing the other passengers like a refugee eating his last meal. Hmm thought I. These people have been traveling United for 4 days they know much more than I do! So I ate my crackers.

When we got to Toronto, I was met by a woman that could have played for the Dallas football team. Or maybe she was related to our prison guard from the 1st flight! “WHERE ARE YOU FROM GIRL!”

I stared at her and tried hard not to pee mah pants while squeaking that I was from Halifax.

“THAT’S FINE PROCEED!” Now at this point I tried to go thru customs! I really did! I went into the customs area and everything! And was met by yet another freaky guard who yelled “what are you doing in here?” I told him I needed to check my bags thru customs to come back to Canada and was told VERY firmly that I didn’t and to go back to the main airport! I shrugged and sauntered into the main airport and went back through security and boarded the FINAL flight home. Which went without a hitch - surprise! Hahah!

Now mind you I had left Norfolk at 8 am or so and was FINALLY getting to Halifax nearly 14 hours later!

When I pulled into Halifax I went to get my suitcases… which I had TRIED to take thru customs you heard me say that right? &lt;G&gt;

No suitcases

Went over to the lost luggage counter….. My hair was hanging down, my clothes were dirty and wrinkled, I looked like that old man from flight number two! Cant find my suitcases.

Agent looked at me with surprise…..didn’t you go thru customs in Toronto?",1,My Adventures in Traveling - or Never fly United!,27

IM=Incompetent Manager



tl;dr at bottom 




This happened to me a few years ago at a fast food place that serves square burgers, that I went to a couple times a month. I didn't usually have problems, except for the odd missing item or wrong toppings that they always made good on without hassle. 


Lately they'd been messing up more than usual, and I noticed that the turnover was quite high. Except for the manager, there were always new people in the kitchen. The manager that I recognize takes my order, a burger for me, and a poutine for my wife. I pay, and move to wait at the pick up end of the counter. 


I watch the guy I've never seen before making the poutine, because he was literally across the counter from me and I had nothing else to do while I waited. He scooped some fries into the container, opened a plastic bag of curds (basically little squares of cheese) onto the fries, and poured gravy over it. Then, before heating it up to melt the curds, he picks one up, pops it in his mouth, and then licks the gravy from his fingers. He then puts the fingers he just licked back into my food, pulls out another curd, and eats that too. The manager at this point is dealing with another customer, so I just keep my eyes on curd boy until she is done. When she comes back to my end of the counter, he's eaten at least 5 or 6 (about half) of the curds off my poutine, before putting the lid on and putting it under the heat lamp to melt. The manager comes over with my burger, puts it in a bag, and reaches for the poutine to bag it too.



M: Excuse me, I don't want that poutine, I'm going to need a new one. He (I gesture towards the oblivious curd burglar) stuck his fingers in my food after licking them, and ate a bunch of the cheese.



IM: So you don't want a poutine?



Me: I do, just not one your employee has been snacking on please.



IM: Something is wrong with it?



Me: (starting to get irritated) YES, he put his fingers in it after licking my gravy off them and ate my cheese. If he's going to make me a new poutine, please have him wash his hands.



IM: Ok ok, I understand, it will just be a few minutes. 



She tells curd boy to go wash his hands, and make another poutine, and then puts on a drive thru headset and goes somewhere in the back. I can see the sink from where I'm standing, and it looks like he washes his hands properly, so I cross my fingers I'll get a non-contaminated poutine this time. No such luck. Standing full view 4 feet in front of me, he goes through the entire process of eating my curds and licking the gravy from his fingers again. I see the manager before he's done snacking on my food, and wave to get her attention, and she comes over. 



Me: I'm sorry, I'm going to need a refund. 



IM: Your new poutine is not good?



Me: No. Your employee snacked on it again. I just want my money back.



IM: But the burger is ok! I'll just not charge you for the poutine! You can still have it! (says this like she's doing me a big favour.)



Me: Your employee has eaten the curds off two poutines, I have no idea what's been done to my burger, I've been waiting over fifteen minutes for a poutine and burger, and you're letting workers eat your customer's food in front of them. I just want my money back.



IM: But he washed his hands! There is nothing wrong with your hamburger, I can't refund!



Me: Money. Back. Now. (I was no longer feeling polite and understanding.) 



IM: OK, but then you can't have the food! 



Me: Good. 



She processes the refund, and I practically ran out of there. I never went back, and it shut down a few months later for some reason. A new fast food place is there now, but I don't go there either, because they close at 9pm on weekdays, 6pm on the weekend. Really strange hours for a major fast food chain, and I usually go out for food after 9. 



TL;DR


Fast food worker eats cheese off my food in front of me, does it again when making me a replacement, manager doesn't seem to understand why this upsets me, resists giving refund, and the restaurant closes several months later.

My boyfriend and I were going to get some dinner at a Mexi-kinda place called Bubakoo’s. I have a My Hero Academia wallet I carry around with me that has the main characters on one side and their class name on the other. I occasionally get compliments for it from employees at fast food places or retail places, which is nice that people recognize it.

But when I pulled out my wallet, I asked for a bag of tortilla chips like usual. Only the guy taking my order told me he wouldn’t charge me for them because of my MHA wallet. I was just surprised by his kindness, and he told me he’s a big anime fan too, and we usually go to the same local anime convention in a city about an hour away. We discussed some of the stuff we like and what kind of cosplay we were thinking of doing (I’m thinking of doing Charlie from Hazbin Hotel and participating in a Disney genderbent Photoshoot as Basil from the Great Mouse Detective; he’s thinking of doing Shou Tucker from Fullmetal Alchemist or Kazuma from Konosuba).

All of the cash MF is given is hundreds. We get into the restaurant and walk up to the cash register and there’s DK from our school who we’ve been classmates with since junior high (we’re in high school now). DK isn’t very bright, constantly failing in school. All of us order no problem except for MF. He walks up to the register and orders and pays with cash. MF pulls out his hundred and DK’s eyes go wide. DK comes from a poor family and has probably never seen one in his life. MF tries to hand DK the money and DK goes “I can’t take that”.
MF confused asks why not. DK proceeds to say “I cant do the math for that, just keep it”. MF laughs and says “DK it’s alright take the money and I’ll do the math” which he does and is honest about the change. DK thanks him and says “when they hired they never told me I had to be a fucking human calculator”. MF says “you know the machine tells you the change amount right?” To which DK responds “yeah but every SOB that walks in her pays with card ‘cept your rich ass, I’m just gonna steal me a school calculator for the next time you walk in here”.

I live in a big city where Uber and Lyft are very common. It seems that everybody who does own a car has one of those two companies stickers in their windshield. Using a ride-share is very common here. 

One morning I had to be at work at 6, about three hours earlier than normal. The bus from my street to work doesn’t run very often that early, so on these mornings I usually take a Lyft. I called one on the app and went outside once I got the 2 minute warning. A dark sedan was supposed to be pulling up shortly. 

A dark sedan with a Lyft sticker pulled up. The street was otherwise empty, being so early, and I opened the door. The driver goes “Uh... Robert?” (I’m a female). The gears in my 5:30 am, just-woke-up brain slowly start turning, and here’s what it came up with: “No, but that’s my twin brother’s name. Maybe they got us mixed up.” A moment of silence passed before the driver goes “Uh... well I’m here for Robert, so...”. At this point another dark sedan pulls up, and a guy comes out of the building next to mine. It dawns on me that this is my neighbors ride, my ride is the one that just arrived, and I just said one of the dumbest things to have ever come out of my mouth. It was awkward.

Decided to order something from the local 24/7 diner chain through their app that she could heat up later in the day. 

Roll by at 6:15 this morning when it said it'd be ready, lights are off. There's a kids menu placemat taped to the front door with ""WE R CLOSED"" (sic) scribbled in *crayon* on it. First front door is unlocked, and I walk in and see someone asleep in the 6 top round booth by the door. I can vaguely make out a diner uniform under their blanket. Back of house looks totally empty. It would seem that in their efforts to properly recognize the holiday of the patron saint patrick, they left third shift to the vices of nature and the average metabolic rate of alcohol.

Not one to return home empty handed, I went to the local 24/7 waffle dispensary and gave them my business instead. But that leaves me in an annoying spot. The app already took my money and I obviously didn't leave with food from them.

She paid for canapés and an open bar. She also hired a photo booth from another company. 

After setting up the decorations at 4pm, she decided to go home and get ready. She let the bar staff know, and headed off home ready to come back later.  

I arrived around 7.30pm with my partner. Most people had already arrived and my mum introduced me to those I didn’t know. Half of the party were deaf, and the other half hearing. The lights had be kept on in order for everyone to communicate. 

While getting photos done in the photo booth, the photo booth staff member pulled me aside. He said he wanted to tell me something. He told me while my mum was leaving earlier that afternoon, the bar staff were laughing and making jokes behind her back. While she was none the wiser, he thought it was important to mention to me because it made him feel uncomfortable listening to, and he said it was really wrong of them. He lives with a stutter and said he understands how it feels to be made fun of and wanted to bring it to our attention. 

I waited until the end of the night to mention something to the manager. He laughed it off and said no way would they do that and got very defensive. My partner and I left for an Uber outside. Then, the owner of the establishment chased us outside. He encouraged us to come back for drinks on the house so we wouldn’t leave a bad review. We declined.

We quickly learned over the course of our stay that the location and town, in general, was anything but normal. 

When we arrived, the staff was accommodating and pleasurable. A couple of us went up to the bar for a night cap after a long day of travel. We were the only people there. I was hoping for a hot chocolate with Bailey's, but unfortunately, they did not have hot chocolate. After some banter with the very nice bartender and off duty waitress, we made a deal that if I come up with the powder, they will make it for me the next night. 

Breakfast in the morning was INTERESTING. The off duty waitress from the previous night was our waitress this morning. She looked like she hadn't slept. My boss asked for a glass of milk. They were out. The waitress offered to go to her room (sob story as to why she was staying in the hotel for an extended period of time) and bring milk up from her fridge. He said it was ok and not a problem, she did it anyway. My co-worker asked for fresh fruit as her side, they were out. My other co-worker asked for a breakfast wrap, but apparently they didn't have all the ingredients needed for the wrap. The already small menu got exponentially smaller. 

We opted for a group dinner at another restaurant down the street. My co-worker decided he was going to do the food challenge there by eating an absolute monstrosity in 20 min. He did, but the prize (a free t-shirt) was currently out of stock. Not just in his size or requested color - they were completely out of tshirts. 

We try breakfast at the hotel again, because it was included with our room rates. Again, no milk, no fresh fruit, no wraps, and now no creamer for our coffees. Also, our previous waitress who was living in the hotel was a no call/no show for her shift, so our new waitress was still in her scrubs from working overnight hospice care. 

The room I was sharing with one co-worker smelled like a head shop every evening around 1830. We let the front desk know. They said they knew exactly who it was that was hot boxing their bathroom, and offered to move us to another room. We were also ensured we wouldn't be charged the smoking fee. We stayed where we were because we were too exhausted to move to another room. 

This repeated for the rest of our stay. But the icing on the cake is on Saturday evening, there was a gentleman sitting on one of the couches, polishing a rock. Very odd behavior, but considering everything else we had experienced, we just shrugged our shoulders and carried on. Come Sunday morning, after our let down of a breakfast again, we came down to the lobby and the polishing rock guy from the night before is getting arrested and his bags are being gone through by 3 lovely officers. 

Upon checking out, we laughed at the absurdity of the entire trip and the front desk said, ""oh you guys missed it. Last night someone else got arrested."" Like it is an every day occurrence. 

I hope we travel to this location again soon with the rest of our crew because until you see, smell, get shafted, and experience the entire area, you'll never believe that this was a normal weekend in that town. 

10/10 would recommend for the free entertainment
5/10 for lack of food and tshirt stock. 

Edit : I have been asked about the sob story so here it is. 

Boss : ""why are you staying here?"" 

Waitress : ""Well, we are renting this house, but the dryer broke and the landlord won't fix it. So, we've been drying our clothes using baseboard heat. So, we have this $800 electric bill.

But within TWO days, I have dealt with two reps that have made me very angry.

&amp;#x200B;

The first one was the customer service rep for the [pogo.com](https://pogo.com) gaming site.  I found the phone number online to call, because of their switch to EA and no longer being able to log in. I can't log in to contact them, and I need to contact them BECAUSE I can't log in.  I also wanted to cancel my membership, not the account, because I can't spare the 40 bucks to renew for the year. (Luckily it was on my old debit card, so I wasn't charged.)

&amp;#x200B;

I called them, and the guy said he was going to look into my computer to diagnose why I couldn't get in.  Ok...  I would have said no, but it was the number for Pogo. He was telling me how my computer was 80% infected, that 8 people were using my account. Not true at all, because the site recognizes my password with my username.  It gets to a point where I tell him, ""You are pogo's customer service, correct?"" He tells me yes, and I tell him all I wanted to do was stop the charge from going through by cancelling the renewel for the membership. He then says how I can't do that until my computer is clean.  What??  I tell him that the computer has nothing to do with it, and he replies with ""You're not listening to me! I can get you over to our tech support to clean your computer!"" So wait a sec, you're doing technical stuff on my computer, and you're not a tech??  Just cancel my damn membership!!

&amp;#x200B;

The next story is about my delivery driver for food.  He's late, no biggie.  But has the balls to yell at ME because like always, they never read the delivery instructions that say, ""Front door broken, go around back"".  He calls, I tell him to go around the ramp on the side, that we're at the back door.  I wait, wait some more, and he calls again.  Again, I tell him to go to ramp on the right side, that we're at the back door. We end the call, as I hear him yelling while walking, ""Oh my GOD! Oh my GOD! Oh my GOD!""  He hands the food to my, nearly tossing it, and  he tells ""I HOPE you enjoy your food!"" In a sarcastic tone. Like wtf?  All he had to do was read the instructions to get to us, no reason to yell at me.

My girlfriend and I were at a coffeeshop that we went to a few nights a week.  One of her friends shows up with her boyfriend who was 19 at the time.  He had just gotten a fake ID.  There was a bar next to the coffeeshop and he wanted to try it out, so I said I’d go with him.  He shows his ID to the bouncer and he lets him in.  I show my ID to the bouncer and he says, “this isn’t you, this is mine now”.  Granted, I had long hair on my ID, but had chopped it all off.  It was still obviously me if compared faces, my family has very distinctive eyes.  I asked for it back, then told him I really didn’t care about going in as I wasn’t going to drink anyways.  His response was “call the cops” with a smirk on his face thinking I wouldn’t out of fear of getting in trouble with a fake ID.  Well, it’s not legal for a bouncer to confiscate a real government issued ID, even if it's not yours.  This was also a busy shopping center, and there was always a cop walking around for security.  So, I found the cop and reported the theft.  We both walked over to the bar and the cop asks for the ID, he looks at it then hands it to me.  The cop then looks at me and asks if I’d like to press charges.  I say no, but the cop still proceeds to rip the guy a new one saying how lucky he is that I’m not pressing charges and confiscating a government ID is major crime (I think the cop was overly embellishing this).  The cop honestly seemed more pissed than I was.  I went back to coffee with my girlfriend and the cop went inside the bar, I’m assuming to speak to someone in charge, as I never saw that bouncer again at the place.

TLDR:  Bouncer takes my real ID, tells me to call the cops if I want it back.  So, I report the theft to a cop, cop proceeds to rip him a new one and ask if I want to press charges.

285,GroundbreakingJudge5,0,t3_b1oxz6,219,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b1oxz6/the_time_my_perfectly_legal_id_was_declined/,"A few weeks ago, I stopped to get a pack of smokes at the gas station closest to my house, which I frequent pretty often. I'm on a first name basis with most everyone who works there, but this guy was new and I had never seen him before. It was late, and he was working by himself, and had a pretty significant line forming. Apparently his computer had froze and he had to do a whole system reboot of it, and it was going very slowly. No problem, I wasn't in a big hurry, but some other people waiting didn't have my patience.

It finally gets to be my turn, and he asks for my ID. No problem, I'm 31 but I look really young and this guy didn't know me yet. My regular, state ID is expired right now and I haven't been able to get it renewed just yet, but I have a [Passport card](http://imgur.com/a/MCzq3BF) that's still valid that I've been using in the meantime. It's different than the standard passport book, it's an actual card and not valid for international flight. It's mostly for cruises, which is why I got it in the first place. It's was cheaper than the book and I only needed it for the cruise so figured I'd save myself a few bucks and could just upgrade it one day for a discount if I needed to. I've definitely had cashiers and such before look at it weird since they'd never seen one before, but once I explain what it is, it usually just ends in us having a conversation about cruises lol.

So he asks for my ID, and I show him the card. He stares at it for a minute, which is not unusual at this point. I tell him my birthday is in the middle of the card, sometimes people will have trouble finding it. I try to point to it on the card, and he snatches his arm back and tells me not to grab it back from him. Ummm ok. Whatever man. He stares at it for what felt like an incredibly long time, and tried to scan it on his computer, and it didn't take it, since those machines are only set up to scan state IDs, then tells me he can't accept this, since it's not a valid ID, and not only that, but he's gonna have to keep it as it's clearly fake. Umm excuse me, what?? No. No to both. It's a valid ID and not at all fake. I try to explain to him that it's a passport card, issued by the fucking government and actually its more of an ID than a state issued ID. And he's not fucking keeping it. He just keeps shaking his head and saying ""well I've never seen one like this before."" OK so that makes it fake??? Well I've just never seen one before.

Customers behind me have heard this all go down and start taking my side, explaining to him that's a passport card and totally legit. One guy pulled up the info page for passport cards off the official website and showed him the picture and kept telling him its legit. He's still sticking to his guns. Keeps saying he's neberv seen one, so he can't accept it, and is refusing to give me back my ID.

I figure at this point, fuck it. I'll just go somewhere else to get my smokes, but this dude is NOT keeping my fucking passport. He kept insisting he has to keep it, they destroy all fake IDs. No sir you're not keeping my passport, that isn't at all fake. I told him look, you can deny the sale all you want, I don't care at this point, but he has to give it back to me, or I'm calling the police, who will not only make him give it back to me, but will prove that it is, in fact, real. He stuck to his guns for a minute, thinking I was bluffing, but when I took out my phone to start dialing the non emergency number, he said fine, I could take it, but I ""better not come back up in this store trying to pass off a bad fake ID."" Oh really? That's how you wanna play it? OK then.

So I leave and go somewhere else to get my smokes, and they have no issue with my passport card. They next day, I go back in that gas station, and since again, I go there just about every day, I know most all of the employees, including the manager. The manager happened to be working, so I asked him about the new guy, and tell him what happened. He apologized profusely for what happened and promised me he would take care of it. Apparently the dude had to retake a bunch of tests about proper forms of ID, and it turns out dude had already taken all of those quizzes before he was allowed to even work the register, so he had definitely seen pictures and been told what a passport card was and that it is valid. I saw him again a few nights later working, and he wouldn't even look me in the eye. He didn't ID me though lol.

TL;DR cashier refuses to accept my passport card as a valid ID, threatens to keep it until I threatened to call the police. Got him in trouble with his manager.

Edit. I just wanna point out that is clearly not my real passport card in the photo. It's the sample card I found when I Googled passport card. The name on it is Happy Traveler. It's expired. And I'm a 31 year old woman, not a 40something man. ",1,The time my perfectly legal ID was declined because the cashier didn't know what a passport is.,1922

We eat at this local Italian/pizza place about 2-3x/month.  It's always been great food, even though it has an hour wait for delivery.  I live in an RV Resort about two miles away and I tell them to tell the driver to look for the big tree trunk in the front of our site.

I was feeling lazy today, so I ordered some food for delivery and waited almost 90 minutes for it.  I just figured they were having a bad/busy night.  It IS Saturday, after all.  

Now, I had ordered with a card, but I like to tip in cash, if I have it.  So, that's what I did.  

Driver arrives, hands me the food and I ask him for the slip to sign.  No slip.  Check my PayPal, it never went through.  I ask him about the longer than usual wait, because I was unsure if the order taker had heard my number correctly.  He said he tried to call.  I run back inside and just grab 2 $20's for my $31.45 order.  He just started walking away.  I was standing there shocked because no, Dude. You don't get to just run off with an almost $9 tip without asking if I needed change.  I was planning on giving him $7 anyway, so I just asked for a dollar back.  He leaves.

Open food, it's warmish, but I've never had a problem with their food OR the items themselves.   

The fries are burnt, the Pepperoni Roll isn't done on the top crust in the center, they only filled my blue cheese dressing half way- both cups, they didn't put enough sauce on the Boneless Buffalo Chicken.  I was so hungry, that I just ate at that point.  I figured that I would save the roll for tomorrow, trash the fries, and eat half the chicken.  

Two hours later and I'm sitting on the toilet with stomach cramps so severe, that I am dry heaving AFTER taking antinausea medicine, and pooing.  

Before you try to tell me that it doesn't happen that fast, Staphylococcus Aureus has symptoms that may start at 1-6 hours after exposure and it is commonly found in meats and cream dressings.  Even if I had reheated the chicken, I still could have it, so who knows how/what it was in.  FML

I'm never going back there again and I'm taking the food back tomorrow to get a refund.  I can't believe how far they slipped and so quickly.  I mean FOH messed up, BOH REALLY messed up, and the driver messed up.  It's like no one cares anymore.  Someone call Gordon Ramsey or the Health Department.  

ETA. Damnit, I always worried that I would mess up a title one of these times!

We drove around all day looking for a place that was open and wasn't busy (there was some type of holiday, I don't remember). We found one and it seemed pretty nice and wasn't too busy.

We waited and one hairdresser was available and took us both in. I showed him a picture of what I wanted and he said he would give me something ""different"". I wanted a cute short Bob with bangs, my hair was getting quite long.  Before he even started though he told me to smile and took a picture of us on his phone. I'm not very photogenic when it comes to strangers and felt super awkward, but I didn't know what to say. He didn't even ask if I wanted to, just took it and I sat there frozen and probably  ugly. 

He isn't too harsh on my hair, gentle and nice to me, but still felt awkward after the photo. When all is done my hair is super short and layered, very different to what I wanted. My bangs looked pointy and had to grow out for sometime for me to cut them the way I wanted. I looked like a mix between Joan Jett and the main character to an anime. I was excited at first but over time just didn't like it. My hair sort of grew into a mullet. He took another photo when we were done and just made me feel even weirder.

Anyway, me and my group decided to head down to a restaurant, which will be called WP. We sat down and ordered, some of us getting pasta, some of us (me) getting items off of the kids menu like chicken fingers. We get our food and begin to eat, when, suddenly, a guy walked up to our table. He shall be OG for the moment. I’m pretty sure all of us thought that he was either a) a guy trying to make conversation or b) a creepy guy. Here is the conversation that ensued:

OG: Hello.

All of us: Hello. (Note: this was mumbled as we were all taken slightly off guard)

OG: My name is [restaurant name]. I’m the owner of the place.

Now, at this point, my eyes went wide. I knew exactly who he was now. He shall now be called WP, since the restaurant bears his namesake.

WP: Where are you guys from?

Us: Tampa.

WP: Oh, really? I shop there you know.

He said goodbye, and left. Then, my friends looked him up and found out that he was indeed WP and was indeed famous. One of my friends went up and asked for a picture.

We were told that there was a party in the other room and the food might take a little bit longer due to it. It was fine for us and we waited. This is where things went downhill.

At this point my family and I start to realize how long we've been waiting. It's been about 45 minutes and we still haven't been brought our salads. We asked our server and she told us she asked the kitchen multiple times for just a salad and it took 20 minutes to actually get our salads. We ate our salads and waited. A table that had been seated after us received their food, no biggie, we assumed our food would come out soon after. (We were wrong) The table next to us let the server know that they wanted to settle their tab, they had waited about as long as we had. We let the owner know and he said that it would be out very shortly. Awesome! The table next to us received their food shortly after wanting to settle their tab. We continued to wait another 20+ minutes before we flagged him down again. We'd been waiting and hour and a half by this point and he told us that he was just now dropping our food.

We wait another 30 minutes to finally get the rest of he order and the crab. We eat our food and the bill is given to us. The only thing the owner comped was the second order of crab. Call me a complainer or someone wanting free food, but waiting 2 hours for hot food is a unreasonable. Much less paying for that food.

We paid for a suite, and for some reason, while my mom was checking us in at the front desk, I noted a sign that said something along the lines of ""We apologize for the TV, electrical, and internet issues. If any of these services fail to work for you, we will give you one free night. Again, apologies for the inconvenience!"" It was again, just a small, family owned hotel, not a chain, which explains this level of compensation for the services failing. Sure enough, our TV didn't work.

I, again, being 6, had no subtlety. I told my parents that I had seen the sign and that we could get a free night at the hotel. I was little, so I thought this would mean an extra night at the hotel, something I was excited about as a little kid in a new situation. My parents quickly explained what it actually meant, and being normal people/normal consumers, they instantly told me not to make a big deal about it or anything and that it was fine.

That sign right there says ""if your TV doesn't work, you can get a free night"" and our TV didn't work at all.""

So, I look for my disk that the wifi adapter came with to try and fix the drive that the Windows 10 update affectively destroyed.  Upon the box, I noticed two things immediatly.  A 2 year warrant, and a tech support number.  COOL!  I just bought this adapter about 5 months ago, so this is really nice!  I called the number with no hesitation at this point, and the first rep I spoke to is friendly.  A bit up beat and pleasant to speak with.

&amp;#x200B;

We get through the creation of my profile for their systems (I worked in call centers before and have MANY stories to tell about that) and proceed to tell her what happened.  We go through the trouble shooting steps, and she proceeds to send me an e-mail to test if it works.  I inform her it went through, then she sent me the link to the file to update my driver for my adapter.

&amp;#x200B;

COOL!  I end the call in a positive mood, and proceed to access my e-mail through my phone.  I can download files and transfer them to my pc, or so I thought I could, and was really happy to get a quick solution to fix my wifi adapter.

&amp;#x200B;

I clicked on the link in the e-mail; ACCESS DENIED!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, shit.  I call back the company (About 10 minuets passed at this point) and ended up with another representative.  She wasn't as enthusiastic (kinda sounding like me when I was reaching the end of my Call Center Career) but I didn't let that get to me.  I go through verifying myself, informed the rep about what was happening and how I cannot access the link through my phone to download to my pc and fix my internet problem.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, do  you have a spare computer or lap top?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, the only thing I have is a phone with internet access and my desk top computer.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, you can't download the link.  I don't want it to sound racist and sugar coat it, but you can't download the link to your phone.  If you can get access to another computer and put it on a thumb drive, you should be able to download it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I really didn't want to push on what I had JUST heard her say, but from what I understood is that she called it racist to use a phone as a portable storage device.

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, thank you.""  I went ahead and ended my call right after that.  Trying to figure out HOW is it RACIST to use a phone as a portable storage device!?  If you have an idea, please let me know.  This is just confusing me.

Earlier today my bf asked me to schedule him a cupping appointment at this place I go to cause the woman that does it is amazing. He was by me when I was making the call. 

About an hour later I get a call from the place. I answer. LM-manager

LM- Hi you booked an appt and asked for a “gift” at the end. 

Me- Uh what?

LM- You called and booked an appt for your bf and paid for it and asked if he could get a “gift” at the end. We don’t do that. 

Me- What?! No... I booked a cupping appt for him

LM- It says heres you booked a relaxing massage. Who is the appt with?

I say who. 

LM- She isn’t in today. 

Me- The appt is sunday. 

LM- *looks it up* umm yeah. And you already paid for it. 

Me- No I didn’t. 

At this point I should have just said cancel it. 

LM- Oh well it wasn’t you! Haha yeah the receptionist said someone asked for a “gift” at the end and we are trying to nip that in the bud! *laughing*

I then call my bf and tell him the story and he goes “Well I’m afraid to go now! Its going to be awkward!”

I had been sitting thinking about it and how she automatically said it was me and didn’t even look up any information about the appt! And I have been to that place at least 5 times so my info is in their system. 

I called back and got the receptionist and I said I wanted to speak with the manager and she said she was with a client and I said well she called and explained the gift thing. 

Receptionist- Oh hahahha yeah it wasn’t you!

Me- Yeah well now I want to cancel because (gave the reasons). 

Receptionist- Oh.... um okay, I’ll have her call you back when she is done. 

I’m now waiting for her call but I don’t expect one considering how professional she was on the phone the first time I talked to her. 

UPDATE: No call. I’m not surprised. I just tried again and no one answered. I’ll try again tomorrow just cause I don’t want the therapist to have a no show appt.

299,TastesLikeTongues,0,t3_b1i06o,1,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b1i06o/frontline_agents_cant_escalate_calls_some/,"So a while back I bought a pricey item from a large online marketplace-cum-retailer. The item I bought was a used, seller refurbished item. This was a pricey item and usually for that type of item you'd want 3-4 years warranty. I called and asked the customer service rep if it came with a warranty and whether it was the normal. The agent confirmed saying it was the ""normal warranty."" I try to register the item with the manufacturer; turns the manufacturer wouldn't provide a refund. This is where my customer service interactions start.

**Day 1**

I call the customer service department asking about this situation. They tell me that the ""normal warranty"" isn't industry/item specific, it just means you can return the item for a full refund within 30 days. I ask if I can get the warranty that either the seller provides or a third-party warranty the seller offers (ideally for free). They tell me that no, they only provide that with the new item. Around the same time as I bought the item a similarly priced item was made available by a competitor. The difference was that it was marginally ""worse"" (in some somewhat subjective senses) but it came with a full 3-4 year warranty. Now that item and all similarly priced items cost about 20% more. I ask if they have a price match policy of sorts or whether they can somehow provide me with some compensation to makeup for the lost opportunity to purchase. **The agent doesn't know, but decides to escalate the call to a supervisor (doesn't ask me fwiw, they just put me on hold and then I'm transferred).** 

This all takes about a half hour. 

I'm talking to the supervisor. I explain the situation and she seems really receptive. I ask if she could give me a discount towards purchasing a replacement item from the seller. I recount a similar situation, where an item I purchased that was seller refurbished had a defective component and the seller had provided me with credit to purchase a replacement component. She says sure, and in the midst of promising to provide this discount the call disconnects. We were speaking for about 10 minutes.

I wait for about 10 minutes expecting a callback. Nothing, so I call customer service and am connected with a new frontline agent. I ask them if they can proceed with the discount towards a new purchase. **They tell me there aren't any notes of any sort regarding this item.** I explain my call was disconnected, and ask them if they could listen to the previous call. They tell me they lack the option to do so. They tell me only supervisors can do so. **I ask them to escalate the call. They tell me that they lack the option to escalate the call. I'm confused now... Didn't the previous frontline agent just escalate the call?** I mention this. They tell me that they lack the ability to do so. I ask them if there's some sort of formal requirement or a threshold I have to satisfy before they can do so. They repeat they lack the ability to escalate the call. We go back and forth for about 15 minutes. I ask whether the first agent broke company policy and if so this policy seems rather strange (given the likely conditions of their employment, I can understand their reluctance to escalate the call). I thank them for their time and say I'll try my luck again. 

I call again. I'm talking to someone new. I go through the same thing as last time. Again, I'm told that 

**a) there are no notes/emails/documentation at all.**

b) they can't listen to calls

**c) they lack the option to escalate calls.** 

I say the same thing as before. Call lasts about 40 minutes with holds included. I tell them I appreciate their time and effort, the circumstances their in and say I'll try again with someone new. 

**I call the fourth time and am now speaking to a fifth person. I have now spent about 105 minutes including waiting/holds**. This new person seems far more receptive to my situation, asks a lot of questions, remembers details, etc. Within 15 minutes she asks if she can ask her supervisor to listen to the calls. Frustrated, I admit saying ""Can you do that? Surely you'll be fired for that.... After all call center agents shouldn't be escalating calls at the same time frontline agents should be hampered in how they can deal with situations"" I immediately apologize explaining my frustration. She's symapthetic. Her supervisor comes on the line asks which specific calls to listen to. I figure I'll put aside what seems like the lies the other two agents told me, and just ask him to listen to the supervisor call. He listens to it and immediately honours the original agreement. I've gotten my first email at this stage confirming that I am to receive a refund. I assume that's just the way they have to process it in the system, and think nothing more of it. I thank him and the supervisor, apologize for any attitude I may have shown in my previous calls. 5 hours later I get an email confirming that I have the 20% difference in my gift card balance. I go ahead and purchase the replacement item. 

**Day 2**

This is a few days later when the replacement comes. I test it, it works. Perfect! So I repackage the old item and start a refund process. That's when I notice that I am not getting my total refund, I'm only getting 80% of it. I'm quite confused, since the whole idea of this was to get money towards buying a more expensive product I missed out on. So I call up the seller's customer service reps again. I ask to escalate my call. They tell me that they need to see if they can resolve it first. So I explain the situation. Half an hour later they tell me that they lack the option to escalate the call. So we go back and forth for about 15 minutes. I thank them for their time and I tell them that I'll try with someone else. 

I call again. This time I get someone and run them through the history of the issue. After 10 minutes they say, ""ah so I can't listen to the calls, but I can transfer you to my supervisor who can."" Wonderful. I talk with the supervisor. I explain the situation and I also explain that this is over my original budget. She listens to the calls. She realizes that the first supervisor didn't quite understand the situation but had without much caution agreed to put the money towards a new purchase, and that the second supervisor hadn't understood my original request and only processed it as a partial refund. The 20% was mine to keep only if I didn't return the item. We talked it over for about 10 more minutes. She said she'd look into buying the warranty offered by the seller or the third party again. I spend about 20 minutes on hold on-and-off. Meanwhile I'm thinking of an alternative solution.  I figure out that another component company offers a transferrable secondhand warranty. I see that they have a comparable seller refurbished item that can only be three months old at the most (so I'd get 2 years 9 months of the warranty). She tells me there's no warranty available but she likes my solution. I explain I'm a little cash strapped in this situation and she suggests giving me an immediate partial refund on the first item (40%) so that I can purchase this third item which is the last in stock. We go through with that. 

So once I get the refund I purchase the third item, the replacement for the replacement. **At this stage I've made six calls, spoken to nine people, three supervisors and spent quite a bit of time on this.** 

**Day 3**

This is the next day. My replacement has arrived. As I'm packing the second item and starting the return process I notice it says ""$0"" refund. I'm confused by this and am wondering if the whole ""price-match"" esque situation still applies to this new item. So I call up customer service because I'm a masochist. I spend half an hour talking to the person, there are serious communication issues. Not much is resolved except that there might be an issue with the""$0"" appearing, and that I should call back regarding this in a week. I ask to escalate regarding the original promise. I'm told they can't escalate.... I thank them for their time and tell them I'll call again.

I call again. I explain the situation. There's a lot of issues since they want to go ""order-by-order"" asking if everything's resolved at each stage. I explain that the orders are all linked. Communication issues are aplenty. I ask them to escalate, but suspect they won't. Surprisingly they do that immediately. This call has taken about 40 minutes. The supervisor also wants to do things ""order-by-order."" We have communication issues, but finally I explain how everything is linked. The supervisor seems to understand, but then says ""X Seller aims to honour all promises in emails/notes and if there is one we can do so, but there aren't any promises for this specific order."" I tell them (reddit quote/indents indicate supervisor), 

""Yes, but I think the situation may be relevantly similar, I think you should listen to the first call with the supervisor."" 

&gt;""Sir, we can't proceed with the refund without any emails or notes regarding the order."" 

""I don't understand, the second supervisor did process my refund without any emails or notes."" 

&gt;""Sir, when that supervisor processed your refund they had notes and emails regarding your order."" 

""Wait what? When were the emails sent, can you tell me in [relevant timezone]?""

&gt;""They were sent [when I made the first call].""

I'm confused af. I check my inbox. I check my spam. I check my trash. I check my archives. I check the seller website messaging system. Nothing. First email is sent much later. 

""Ok, can you confirm that it was sent at [time they stated]?""

&gt;""Yes it was sent then.""

""I'm checking my email and its nowhere. The first email I received is at [x], the second at [y]. I received no email at time [time they stated] or around that time.""

&gt;""Sir we can, as I said previously, only process the refund if we have notes or emails promising such a partial refund.""

""Look put aside the refund for now. I'm really confused. My inbox doesn't indicate emails and I'm certain the second and third calls I made/second and third frontline agents I called specifically said there weren't any notes/emails indicating any promises. Can you listen to those calls to confirm that?""

&gt;""Sir, sir, sir. Please understand we can only proceed with the refund if there are emails or notes regarding the original promise made. In your situation there are no promises made regarding the third order.""

""Doesn't it strike you as strange that my records seem completely at odds with the information you have? Can you please listen to the second and third calls I made and see whether or not those agents confirm whether or not they have notes/emails concerning my situation at that time?""

&gt;""Please, as I said before, we can only process the refund if----""

""Ok, forget about the refund for the moment. Can you please check the calls? You're a supervisor and can do that right?""

&gt;""Yes, but sir we can as I'm trying to tell tell you only process---""

""Ok, look we should get on the same page because I think we're speaking past one another. Can you or can you not listen to the calls I made?""

&gt;""We can only pro---""

""Can you or can you not listen to the calls?""

&gt;""We have that option.""

""So can you please listen to the call?""

&gt;""Sir we can only process the refund if we see an email or note promising that to the original order.""

""Wait!Wait!Wait! Isn't processing a refund and listening to calls two separate things? Can't you do one without the other?""

&gt;""Please listen to me sir, I can only process the refu---""

""Ok I think we've got as far as we can. I think there isn't much benefit if we keep speaking. Can you transfer me to another supervisor or escalate me to your supervisor?""

&gt;""Sir I don't have a supervisor [the supervisor I spoke to before admitted she had a supervisor when she looked at the max she could provide for an immediate partial refund.] and I'm the only available supervisor right, but you can try calling this number.""

They give me a number. I thank him for his time, apologize for all the annoyance I've been causing and tell him I'll try that number.

I call the number... It's the US version of the seller. Not sure if that was intentional or not. Anyways, they transferred me to my local version of the seller's customer service line. 

This is now my 9th call and 12th person I'm speaking to, I've spoken to four different supervisors. This person within two minutes transfers me to a supervisor after I request it and explain I need them to listen to a call. This supervisor seems incredibly receptive too. They ask what happened and then guess what? They listen to the original supervisor call, the one that was disconnected. She says while the promise wasn't for the third item, it still applied since the situation was basically the same. Within 5 more minutes I get a partial refund for the difference. Additionally I ask her if frontline agents are allowed, as part of their Standard Operating Procedure, to escalate calls. Apparently SOP is that if a customer requests an escalation they are required to do so once they identify the issue. I ask her about whether its SOP for supervisors to listen to the calls when there seems to be conflicting information and oral promises made, or whether they must adamantly only look at the notes/emails. She says ""they should be looking into the calls if the customer seems to be claiming something else and is requesting that the information is in the calls."" I ask her to listen to the calls and send her screenshots of my inbox. She says she's concerned by this behaviour and is going to investigate further and the calls may be used as a training exercise. I have no idea if she's just placating me and/or if I'm going to be used as the annoying customer training call, but jfc I feel vindicated. 

**9 calls, 13 people, 5 supervisors and hours spent... Pretty sure it wasn't worth it.** 

**TLDR: I felt I was owed something for ambigious statements initially made (I should've probably done my own research too and not just assumed ""normal warranty"" was 3-4 years). Regardless of that, I seemingly get lied to and keep facing obstructions from customer service. I seem to be vindicated at the end, but am pretty sure it wasn't worth the effort.** ",1,"Frontline agents can't escalate calls, some supervisors can't listen to calls, and notes spring into existence seemingly retroactively (LONG).",11

There was a special occasion last week so I and my family decided to eat out at our favorite restaurant. Our waitress brings our drinks out, then goes to serve her other tables or whatnot. 

I’ve already drained my glass by the time she comes back to take our order. She seems startled but refills it and carries on. I emptied another glass, which she refilled. The glass was half empty when our food arrived, so she refilled it and jokingly asked if I wanted the pitcher. Completely normal behavior.

Then she crossed a few lines.  I depleted another glass and she patted me on the back and said “You’re a thirsty little man, aren’t you?” before refilling it. Everything about that interaction made me feel uncomfortable. She touched me and called me “thirsty little man.” ew.

After we've ordered and received our food (which was delicious by the way) I hear a disturbance near to our table, and I see a middle-aged woman with a very young kid, maybe 7-8, talking in a very condescending manner to an asian waitress who looked to be either late high school/early college age. The waitress turns around to leave to the kitchen and the woman EXPLODES at her. She grabs her shoulder and yanks her to face her, and everybody in the restaurant could now hear what she was screaming about.

Apparently, the woman did not like that her ramen came with a soft boiled egg, and that it was \*insert Gordon Ramsay voice\* F\*\*\*ING RAW!! For those who do not know, soft boiled eggs (as opposed to hard boiled eggs) are one of the most common ramen toppings, and they are damn good. While some ramen places do cook their soft boiled eggs to below the FDA standard, which really isn't dangerous but everybody freaks out about consuming raw eggs due to salmonella, this place had never in my experience ever cooked a soft boiled egg anywhere close to that threshold, and they were always ""safe for consumption."" Furthermore, in the menu for the restaurant, you can clearly see a soft boiled egg in the picture of the ramen she ordered for her and her son, so if she didn't want it she could have clearly asked either for a hard boiled one or to just remove it from the order.

After a couple more minutes of screaming, the waitress physically runs away from the woman and looks to be severely distressed. After a couple minutes to collect herself I assume, she returns to our table to clear our dishes. Everybody around us was dead silent, but I immediately spoke up, in full earshot of the original woman, and said ""I am really sorry for how that woman treated you. You are a human, and you didn't deserve that at all. You didn't do anything wrong, and if you would like me to tell that to your boss I definitely will."" She nodded once, collected our dishes very stiffly, and ran to the back again, looking like she was about to start crying. The woman was glaring at me until she left, obviously without leaving a tip. We got our check from her and she said thank you for the offer but it won't be necessary. We said of course and paid our check. I paid with a credit card, but I had a little bit of cash, so as my friend and I walked out, I left about the price of one bowl of ramen at the woman's table, so I guess 50% tip. I wish I could have left more, but I'm pretty broke at the moment. I hope that waitress had a better day after that, and seriously people, this sub is full of a lot of negativity towards service workers but at the end of the day it's not hard to just be kind, even if something went wrong with your service, everybody makes mistakes. Also, if you see other people being jerks to wait staff, don't be afraid to stand up for them.

Hope you all have a good day/night!

I was at my dealership getting my oil changed when I went to go check out. I gave the woman one of my credit cards, which I had no idea was expired. When she handed it back to me she gave the greatest “Your card... was declined” I think I’ve ever heard. So much aloofness, it was almost impressive. 

I’m a 20-something kid who looks a lot younger than I am. I also wear sweats on my days off. She probably thought I was some joke, who didn’t belong in her fancy Audi showroom amongst actual professionals. 

Instead of simply asking for another form of payment she decided to make a huge deal of it. Maybe she assumed I was trying to rip them off, or attempt to walk out without paying. She phoned for one of the managers, all the while a small line was forming behind me. I offered another form of payment but she wasn’t having it. 

In walks the manager, who ironically happened to know my family, as my dad is a loyal customer of theirs. She once again keeps making a fool of me in front of everyone, going on and on about something as simple as my card being declined. I’m not sure what he said, but I could see the color wash out of her face when I whispered in her ear. 

I handed over another form of payment, and it naturally went through. When handing me a form to sign she referred to me as Miss Xyz, and asked how I could best be reached for future maintenance.   

I hesitated a second and then replied, ‘it’s actually Dr. Xyz, and I think I may go to a dealership closer to my house next time.’

I've heard her ask other customers how their kids were, etc.)  The way she does it is friendly, not creepy.... and she treats everyone, from homeless people to folks who roll up in fancy cars - with the same warm courtesy.

Today I went in a little later than usual and she'd already left. As I was paying, ""Dennis,"" the young man whose shift overlaps hers, said ""Hey, Dawn is leaving. Do you want to sign her card?"" He motions toward a card on the counter. I opened it and it. was. jam. packed. All kinds of messages - some just wishing her well, others including details so she would know who they were (""Kevin who always buys the Krispy Kreme donuts,"" etc.) and several that included contact information. There was not a single space left; the inside and back were completely full and there were even a few on the front. I was going to ask  Dennis if he had more paper, but as I was putting the  card back I saw that there was a second one - about two-thirds full inside, but still plenty of room so I added my little note of congratulations. (She was moving because her daughter had just had her first baby - Dawn's first grandchild - and she wanted to be closer.)

I asked if they were collecting money for a gift, and Dennis laughed and said ""People keep asking that. We're not allowed to collect money, but thank you for thinking of it.""

I called in to place our name, and the hostess mentioned that our wait time would not start until we got there to the restaurant. That stuck me as odd, because why have a call in system then? There is no benefit to it.

The hostess tried to explain that it was a good thing but kept reiterating that the wait time would not change. I got annoyed and just ended the call without giving our name.

307,naplex016,0,t3_b0v8st,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b0v8st/terrible_experience_at_a_fast_food_restaurant/,"Today I placed a mobile order for a Quarter Pounder with bacon meal and a couple of additional items. I made my way to the store, was harassed for money by homeless people four times both outside and inside the building, and was greeted by the usual set of employees for whom abrasiveness appears to be a mandatory job qualification. When I indicated that I was there to pick up a mobile order, one of the employees informed me that they were out of the Sprite Tropic Berry I had selected when I placed the order, so I said I would just pick another soft drink. She responded by telling me that they were out of all soft drinks.

At this point I'm annoyed. In general I'm a big fan of using mobile apps to order food, but this chain in particular seems to have a problem where 75% of the time they're out of something you ordered. Other restaurants have found simple solutions to this problem. For example, PB's app (the place that sells sandwiches and soup, since apparently this subreddit has some stupid rule where you can't name companies even if it's positive) is great and shows you in real time which items are out of stock. C's employees (the place that sells burritos) take the initiative to call you and let you know when something is unavailable so you know before you get there. But I consistently have problems with this chain, and it's gotten to the point that I've just started requesting refunds on principle. There's usually some grumbling on the employees' part, but eventually the manager begrudgingly comes over to give me my money back.

Well this time, several employees snapped at me that they can't do refunds for mobile orders. I said, ""Yes you can. I've gotten them multiple times. If the items I paid for are not available, then I want my money back."" They kept arguing with me, and even the manager yelled from the back of the store that I had to call customer service and get a refund from there. I said that I was going to call right then and there before leaving the store, and the employees were like, ""Fine."" It was hilarious though because after I got on the phone with customer service and the store's employees heard them taking down the store's address and my contact information, the manager came out of the back and said she'd give me a refund, despite the fact that ten minutes ago they couldn't do refunds for mobile orders. I guess they didn't expect me to call before leaving the store.

I made a point to continue the conversation with the 800 number as the manager was refunding me because the appalling quality of service at this location needs to be addressed (seriously, whenever I take a trip into the suburbs, I can go to this chain without having to worry about some nonsense impeding me getting my food). Eventually she handed me $11.71, but my order was $13.55. I informed her of this, and she started arguing again. I pulled up my bank's app to show her that my credit card was charged $13.55, but she kept giving me trouble until I noticed that the reason for the discrepancy was that she had only refunded me for a regular Quarter Pounder, not one with bacon. So then she walked away and came back with enough change to make it $13.00. I'm like, ""Are you serious right now? I paid $13.55, and I want $13.55 back."" She finally gave me the money.

I don't like to raise my voice at fast food workers because I know they get enough grief already, but this whole experience was just mind boggling. If I paid for something and you don't have it, then give me my money back. Simple. Don't lie to me saying you can't do refunds and then try to scam me out of less than $2 when you finally agree to the refund. What the hell is wrong with this company?",1,Terrible experience at a fast food restaurant.,29

I Just had a painful half hour experience with Large\_online\_retailer chat support getting a refund for a package that was never delivered by Large\_online\_retailer's delivery service, not UPS, USPS etc.

We started experiencing occasional multi-day late deliveries from Large\_online\_retailer's own sourced deliveries during the 2nd half of 2018. Usually things arrive eventually, maybe a refund or two but we didn't mind much.

But those couple refunds in the past happened automatically, well, after requesting online. Now it is painful, seemingly to discourage the consumer from trying. I had to chat with **four customer service reps** for no given reason.

The latest failed delivery was same/next day shipping for a birthday present and never made it from carrier's posesion. Here is current shipping status.

A week later than originally expected delivery date, today, was the first day I could request a refund. Did that online then got this email:

So went to chat support which took nearly a **half hour and four representatives** to get through. See oddly painful chat support transcript:

IMHO, from recent experience, it feels like Large\_online\_retailer is starting some sketchy business practices to make it harder for consumers to get their refunds. It's already bad enough you have to wait a week to ask for a refund for lost packages, and the frequency of delivery problems is increasing... but now its starting to feel like some of those evil mobile phone carriers or insurance companies who make it really hard for consumers to get their money due... evil and greed lurks!",1,Large_online_retailer starting to make refunds harder - getting sketchy,22

I picked out what I needed and headed to checkout. Grand total: just under twenty bucks, no biggie. Inserted my card, punched in my PIN, machine says approved, please remove card. All normal so far. Wait, not so fast.


Cashier: Ok hang on, we had a power outage earlier and the system is slow.

Me: No problem, I understand.

Cashier: Wait, something is weird, it's not letting me finalize the sale. *waves manager over*

Now at this point, I pull out my phone and check my bank account. It shows the transaction as posted, ***not pending*** and that it has gone through normally.

Me: It's come out of my bank already, see?

Manager: No, it hasn't been finalized on our end. There's a button I have to hit before the sale is complete, and it won't let me do it. 

Me: Well, it's already left my bank account, can we complete it some other way? 

Manager: You can run your card again.

Me: Ummmm, no. I'm not paying for this twice.

Manager: It hasn't gone through, it's just pending on your end. Just run it again and the other one will fall off in a few days.

Me: This is a debit card, so I'll be out that money if I run it again.

Manager: Well, can't you just use a credit card?

Me: I don't have one. And I'm not sure I want to run this again when the first one shows as posted. I've paid for my items.

Manager: *Getting really snarky* No, you haven't. My system isn't working correctly and it can't charge you until I hit this button. You haven't paid for anything, and you're not taking the items. 

I call my bank at this point, and there's not much they can do. They told me that if his system truly needed that button press to finalize the sale it should reverse itself. While I was just outside the door speaking with my bank, they re-shelved all of my items.

Me: Okay, so if this charge doesn't come off, can I come back in here and get my money back?

Manager: *smug smirk* Yeah, you just come see me.

Me: I'll get the supplies somewhere else. I don't think I want to shop here.

Manager: *sarcastically* Thanks for being so understanding.

While all this went on, 10-15 other customers got checked out just fine. I talked to two different departments at my bank, and my card wasn't an issue. Even they couldn't believe what an ass this guy was being. Good thing I didn't need that stuff in a hurry.

i open the door, say a kind ""hello, how are you guys?"" they just didn't say anything to me at all and the owner rudely said ""what do you want?"" in a shouty tone. they cook the food fresh and the place is expensive so takes a while for our kebabs to be made so i sit at the 2 tables provided. was extremely awkward as i broke my phone so i couldn't look like i was entertained and i was put off by the rude attitude as i've been there 3 times before.

So mom needed a piece of furniture. The social worker (SW) suggested that we order it and have her pick it up at a store location of Big Box Store (BBS) near mom’s house. 

I ordered it using a credit card in my sister’s name that we only use for mom’s expenses, so when I ordered I entered sister’s billing address into the screen. 

Ordered the item as “pick up in store”, but shortly afterwards received an email saying the item was out of stock and click here to have it delivered instead. So I Clicked There and was immediately informed that the package was on its way to my sister’s billing address. The system never asked where we wanted the package sent. There was no option to enter a different address, so I called BBS customer service right away to fix it. 

“Oh sorry, we can’t cancel the order or change the address. It’s already on its way.”  This was literally __minutes__ after I placed the order. 

They said I could contact shipping company and change the address but that wouldn’t work until the package reached a certain point in the shipping sequence. What?

I kept calling BBS customer services and guest services and filled out two different surveys about my purchase and delivery experiences. Guest services eventually gave me a case number and assured me that the address had finally been changed and my mother would receive it in a few days. 

Several days later, a text from my sister with a photo of a box. “Guess what’s on my doorstep”. 

Ugh. BBS refunded us our money but wouldn’t take the item back so we have a free thing we don’t need, and it’s too expensive to ship it up to mom. Fortunately the SW says we can manage without it. 

In this day and age with modern software there was zero reason this should have happened. I’ll never order from them again. ",1,The unstoppable delivery that I couldn’t cancel or redirect despite hours with customer service.,92

If I am wrong, please tell me where i can post this!\]

So a bad habit of mine is spending a lot of time in the chain video game store nearby, as my mom can attest I am very bad at choosing what I want to get. I've spent maybe an hour at a time in there just walking around browsing, probably to the employees annoyance but never really caused a hassle. While I never really have anything interesting happen other than annoyed kids, I like to think that one day I'll witness something interesting. 

And interesting enough, something did happen. One night I'm browsing around after taking my moms car to the store, just doing my usual rounds to find anything cheap enough to not break my wallet. But as I am, a young man \[lets call him SC, for suitcase\] in his early 20s walks into the store carrying a suitcase with him. I don't question much but because I'm extremely nosy I keep browsing within earshot of the counter.

SC goes up to the employee working the counter, and explains he wants to sell a PS4 that he has inside the suitcase. Fair enough, people can carry stuff in anything. What I learned later from the employee was that the suitcase not only had the console inside, but a lot of clothes and cologne that SC apparently was surprised to find beneath the console. 

What I also learned that night was that to sell anything to the game store, you have to have a valid ID. I didn't ask why, but I can imagine its because of stuff like this and other sketchy situations. So of course, the guy hands him an ID and the employee looks it over. After a quick cursory glance the employee then enters the ID into his computer and hands it back to him.

""The name that came up isn't yours"". he says to SC. This is when I start to listen up a bit more, but sadly cannot quite remember the name that came up. All I remember that it didn't fit the ID that SC had. SC starts to whine a bit, and explain that he might have had the wrong one and asks the employee to hold onto the console until he can come back with a valid one. The employee explains he cannot do that, and SC continues to whine about it before leaving the store and saying that he will return.

Before I could ask what happened \[as i missed a lot of the situation and I wanted to be nosier\], the employee proceeded to pull out a phone and call about 3 or 4 other chain stores within driving distance \[its a big chain you can guess which one\] to warn them about SC and what he was trying to do. After this I chat with the employee a bit, and he explained what I explained before in much clearer detail, and how insanely fake the ID was. He named a few telltale signs, such as air bubbles on it and uneven font and I just can't believe the guy would even attempt to do anything with such a clear fake.

I went to ask if anything like this happened before, or even happens often if they've heard about it and the employee just said it was the first time it ever happened. ",1,Can you sell a Playstation 4 back with a fake ID?,15

So myself and my partner book a backpackers while travelling. We arrive to the city about 10.30pm and book into this backpackers at $150 per night.

We see many signs in the way to room saying anyone caught in a room without a bed will immediately occur a $100 fee added to the bill. We get to our room and find a man sleeping on a couch just outside the door. Whatever seems strange to us seems all the signs but hey if staff don’t care neither do we.

315,michellearmlong,0,t3_b0miku,3,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/b0miku/nightmare_bank/,"A few months ago, I moved from British Columbia to New Brunswick. The bank that I was with at the time was a small credit union in my hometown. I decided it would be smart to switch to a local/more mainstream bank, in case a problem arose, or I wanted to change anything about my accounts, etc. 

The bank I settled on was a large, wellknown one, red logo, and the biggest draw for me was that they offer a ""passport debit card"", which allows you to gain reward points (similar to AirMiles) and you don't have to pay fees on foreign ATMs. Another benefit was that I was able to fill out all the paperwork online, and I only had to go into the branch for a few minutes to sign a few papers and pick up the card. 

So it's all going well at this point, I gave my new information to my work and gym that day, but later that evening I tried to pickup a few groceries, and my card gets declined. Weird, as I had just loaded up the account, and was told I was good to go. So I called the customer call center, and the man on the phone told me that after I signed up online for an account, I had to go into my local branch to activate it. I told him I already did that, and he was very confused, but told me I should go back anyways. So the next day, I went back to the branch, and they realized right away that they forgot to take off the hold on my account when they activated it. A little annoying, but hey, mistakes happen, it wasn't a big deal, and I was just happy my card was now working. 

The next week goes by smoothly. My card's working fine, I'm enjoying the perks of having a visa debit for the first time, my paycheck got direct deposited smoothly, everything's going great. 

Until I get an email from my gym titled ""oops, you missed a payment"". It told me that when they tried charge my bi-weekly $5 fee, they were unable to due to either a) incorrect banking information, or b) insufficient funds. I checked my banking app right away and had more than enough to pay the $5 fee, so I figured it must be the information that I gave them earlier that week. And I would be charged a $25 service fee for this. But when I went in the next morning to check, the banking information they had for me was correct, so they told me to check with my bank. On my way home from the gym, I stopped to get more groceries, and my card got declined again. 

At this point it's after business hours on a Friday, so I know there's nothing I can do until Monday morning. I tried my card once again that weekend and got declined again, despite sufficient funds and there being no hold on my account.

Monday morning, I call the bank again (bonus: the ""direct"" number listed on the business card of the teller who opened my account was really the number for the national customer call center) and the man couldn't figure out why my account wasn't working, so he told me to go back in. So I do. 

I spent over 3 hours in my bank that day trying to figure it out, to no avail. They kept sending me to the dollar store across the street to test it out, which seemed quite unprofessional and rude to the cashier there who had to deal with me coming in 5 times in a row and having my card declined. At the end of the day, they said the only hope was to close and re-open my account, but I decided that in order to hopefully avoid further issues like this one, I was going to switch banks (again). They were understanding, but then the worst part of this story happened. 

Now, this was very poorly explained to me by the teller, but from what I understand, in order to give me the sum of my accounts in cash, she had to close my chequing account followed by my savings account, but she did it in the wrong order, which lead to a cheque being printed ""off-site"" for what was in my savings account. She said the cheque would be mailed to me in ""just a couple of days"". At this point, I was pretty pissed, but I just took my chequing account cash and went to the bank across the street. 

Weeks go by. It's been 16 business days since I left that bank, and I still don't have my cheque. My rent is due the next day, I was kind of panicking, so I sent the woman who initially opened my account an email, and the response I got was something along the lines of ""the cheque may have been lost in the mail, there's nothing we can do, sucks for you"".  So I emailed the manager of that bank, told her the situation, and she told me that the day I closed my account, THE CHEQUE HAD BEEN PRINTED AT THAT BRANCH, AND THEY HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ME TO COME PICK IT UP. To summarize, they told me they would mail me a cheque, realized later (presumably the next time someone printed something and found a cheque in the printer) they had it in the branch, didn't contact me to tell me to pick it up, told me it was lost in the mail, and waited for 3 weeks until I panicked.

My boyfriend recently moved in with me temporarily while he finds a job, and I wanted to surprise him with one of those coffee mug Hydro Flasks (he *loves* coffee) to make him feel more comfortable/at home, so I ordered it from OnlineStoreEveryoneUses. 

I ordered it on Thursday February 28th, and it was supposed to come two days after that (Saturday 3/2). It got delayed, saying it would be in the following day, so I waited. Monday comes and goes, it didn't arrive-it was delayed again. This went on until Wednesday, where they promised me a full return if it hadn't arrived by then. I made the call and, after normal introductions and verifications, the representative just sat there reading to me exactly what I had just told her.

R: ""It's been delayed/lost in transit."" (Yes, I know this, this is literally what I *just* told you). ""I can give you a full refund, and you will still receive the package whenever it arrives.""

I was fine with this, this was good, so I thanked her a bunch and it was over (*no it wasn't).*

After a few days, I see I received the refund, only to see the package's status as ""Returning to Sender."" Confused, I called again, went through the verifications again and explained the situation (that I was meant to receive a refund and still get the package, because it was delayed at this point an entire week). AGAIN, the representative repeats to me exactly what I had just described. ""Your refund was processed and it looks like the package is being returned to its sender."" On top of this, I was also transferred to Logistics, where they repeated to me that same statement. I stayed friendly, as I know accidents/mistakes happen, and the women were very nice and offered to fix the issue. Unfortunately, I had to order a new one and now wait until a few days, as the item was then out of stock and wouldn't be back in until then. I placed the order, and she said she'd process the refund *correctly* this time, saying that all the previous representative had to do was check a box when refunding that says to still deliver the package. I said thank you and carried on with my day.

To be safe, I called again the next day, because I hadn't seen any message about a refund being processed like I had with the others, and I wanted to check to make sure it would be done. This time a man answers, and when I explain the situation he gets oddly defensive and a bit rude, saying, ""I don't understand the problem, I don't see why you should be getting any of this"" and the like (*because it's been over a week now and I still don't have my package).* He repeated that same statement 3 times, putting me on hold each time until finally deciding to contact the previous representative that helped me, who explained the situation. He said she had just gotten busy and that he would do the refund, ensuring me that *I would still get the package.* He promised this at least 3 times because I asked to clarify it that many times. This call was yesterday.

Now comes today (this morning). I checked on the status of the package, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW! IT'S RETURNING TO SENDER! **AGAIN.** I called, and got another woman reading to me from the same script, repeating to me again exactly what I had just told her as a means of somehow giving me more information. For the first time of these calls, I got a bit upset. 

Note: I work in customer service (I have for 4 years), so I know to be friendly in these situations because it's really not the individual's fault as it's never the same person. They're there to help me and I appreciate/respect that.

I told her the whole story. I told her how her fellow representatives all told me the same thing, and that I needed a supervisor. After a short hold, I was given to another person (who weirdly still sounded like she was reading from a script), who decided to inform me that **there is no option to refund and continue sending a package.** And, to top it off, she couldn't even send me a replacement. She told me that's not an option for her, and all she can do is give me a $20 gift card for a **$56 purchase.** I'm a low income college student. I placed this order when I knew I had the money to do it (pay day). I just wanted to get something nice for my SO to celebrate his move in and his interviews, but instead I've had 12 days of my time wasted and stressing out only to be told that the 4 people I talked to (3 representatives, 1 in logistics) all lied to me. There was never an option for them to refund while still sending me the package. Hell, I would've been fine just paying full price again the first time this happened when I had money in my account! At least I would've had it by now.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and to top it all off, I had it sent to a pick-up location that's right near my work, to make things ""easier,"" but it's only convenient for the days/times I can go to work and have time to do the pick-up between classes and my shift. So every day I worked I had to frantically check my phone to see if I could use my break to go to the pick-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Note about the price: the mug was the largest size and originally $43.65 (roughly, with tax), but the supervisor I talked with told me that the only available option left that she could get for me was a third party seller whose price was listed at $55 and some change.

She was on my family cell phone plan. Despite her imminent death, she insisted on getting a new phone, as her old one was kinda broken. You can't say no, so we go down to the phone store and get her an inexpensive phone. It's still like $200, so they let me pay it off in payments. About 2 months after that, she passes. I fully expected to have one of these customer service nightmares. At a minimum, I thought I'd have to pay off the phone. I go to the shop with the phone and tell them the situation. They take the phone back, remove mom's line from my account and that's it! I was out of there in 5 minutes.

319,SunnyLila,0,t3_azt2b4,63,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/azt2b4/customer_service_from_hell_insists_on_speaking_to/,"A little backstory, my family owns a house with three separate apartments but due to some kind of weird wiring of something like that only the  apartment on the first floor can have it's own internet connection and the rest of the house has to use the same wifi. We've been with the same provider for as long as I can remember and as long as it's working it's great, when it's not working calling the customer service is a real nightmare. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the internet isn't working it's always an issue with the cables and never there fault, so we have made it a point to change the cable before we even call, even though they still blame it one an issue we have caused. I will never forget the one time the powercord of the router wasn't working anymore due to overheating and the guy from the customer service told my mother there routers have no powercords and since she had added something to the router that wouldn't belong to it they were unable to help and we had to get a new router. 

&amp;#x200B;

We would have changed providers years ago, but all the other providers only offer slower connections and since we are all working from home and need to be online that wasn't an option at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to the main story. Last April my mom passed away and since I took over taking care of everything that needed to be done since my sister was dealing even worse with our mother's sudden passing. All the companies I had to call to change contracts in my name or cancel them were very quick and helpful in this situation... all except the flipping internet provider. 

&amp;#x200B;

As my mother's heiress I'm entitled to simply take over the contract and get it in my name under the same conditions. It's even on their website clearly written out. So, I call them and the employee tells me that indeed, I can take over the contract, and he will sent me a form via email and asks me to send it back filled out and with a copy of the death certificate. I fill out the form, attach the death certificate and wait for the reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the next day, when I see a reply in my inbox and get the accute urge the smack the shit out of someone or more accurately the same employee who sent me the email with the form and who had now replied to me that all contracts are not transferable to another family member and that my mother would have to sign a different form to cancel her contract so I could make a new one. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm stunned and even double checked if I had missed to sent the death certificate but no, I did indeed sent it. So, I called the hotline again and was now speaking to a different employee. I explained the issue and she asked me if it was ok if she would put me on hold for a moment so she could sort the issue out. I agreed and waited.... and waited... and waited... I was already on hold for twenty minutes and my patience was wearing thin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have worked in the customer service of an airline, a package delivery service and gaming console support, so I know that keeping a customer on hold should not take this long, in fact the only acceptable reason to keep someone on hold for 20 minutes is if the building is on fire and you have to evacuate immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I kept waiting when suddenly the awful music ended and I could hear the typical call center backround noises, however, no one was speaking to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hello!?

&amp;#x200B;

Followed by a click and beep beep beep. Yup, she freaking hung up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm furious and call again, only to speak to yet another employee. I apologize in advance for being upset and she looks into it and says:

&amp;#x200B;

Employee: If you want to takeover your mother's contract she will have to call us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: My mother is dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Employee: You shouldn't be saying something like that only to get what you want, Ma'am.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Can I speak to you manager?

&amp;#x200B;

Employer: They can't tell you anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I want to speak to your manager, NOW!

&amp;#x200B;

Again I am put on hold and finally speak to the manager who apparently has been informed or dare I say misinformed by his employee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: Ma'am since you are not our customer I cannot discuss this contract with you, have your mother call us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: My mother is dead, so unless your internet/landline can reach the afterlife I'm sorry but she is unavaible at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: Well, then you should have provided us with a death certificate!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I did to which I got the reply that my dead mother has to sign a form.

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: That is nonsense, we are a professional company and I am opening your e-mail right now and it does not... oh.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Say what?

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: I'm sorry Ma'am I am transfering the contract right away, I apologize. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I expect to receive a confirmation within the hour or I will make this public. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: Of course, Ma'am. Btw, have you heard about our new movie package...

&amp;#x200B;

Me: hangs up

&amp;#x200B;

So, I got the contract in my name and I'm still with the company, however I am hoping that soon another provider will offer the same internet speed in my area, so I can leave this company and their customer service from hell for good.

I've had my hair cut short everytime I'm tired of it from being too long and I usually get it cut to about midneck.

I go into this salon thinking it'll be much of the same experience. 

Instead of me saying what I wanted and having it done I was told I shouldn't get it that short and she proceeded to cut it about shoulder length. I kept trying to tell her I wanted it midneck with layers, something I've had before numerous times but she just denies me of the haircut I want.

She was saying that I should wait a month to see if I want it shorter so it makes me think she just did this to get me to come in again. I'm more likely gonna go get my hair cut again soon from a different place now and never come back.

I also wanted to donate my hair but I think she cut it too short to meet the requirements (she cut 6 inches off but I wanted around 8 inches off).

Backstory. My father passed away almost 3.5 years ago. He had a medical emergency while driving his pick up truck. Crashed the truck, I was told he was dead before the truck wrecked.

Now to my story.

The dealership my father purchased his truck from was a local place in our home town. I started receiving letters from them stating that they want to buy my fathers truck. I ignored them at first, after the 10th one, I got mad. I called the dealer and told them, the truck was wrecked, please stop contacting me. I was polite yet firm about it. I thought it took care of the problem, 2 months after that they restarted. My husband went to the dealership and had a ""conversation"" with the manager. The letters stopped for a few weeks, then restarted. At this point, we were about 17 to 20 letters received.

I finally had enough of it. I contacted a lawyer and explained the situation (with evidence, I kept every letter). He told me that it was definitely considered harassment. He offered to take my case, but I couldn't afford the fees. He did give me a letter saying that if they didn't leave me alone that I had retained legal representation. The lawyer was a family friend and helped me out with that letter. I contacted corporate for the dealership and mailed them the lawyer letter and a letter from me, explaining that if I received another letter from them, the lawyer would pursue further legal action against the company.

I received a final letter from corporate, apologizing for the harassment. I'm told the manager of the dealership received a lovely phone call from the higher ups at corporate.",1,We want to buy your truck,117

To whom it may concern:

  
I wanted to obtain a partial refund for my service order, and I wanted to explain why.

  
My technician arrived on Wednesday, several hours late, with the mount. While using a stud finder, he was not able to find any studs in the wall. He asked if he could make a few pilot holes with the drill to test for studs. After a number of holes, he was not able to find any studs in the wall, so he instead installed some anchors and the full-motion mount. Once the TV was up, he noted that the top screw had some give, and out of abundance of caution asked if he could come tomorrow with some different hardware. I said yes, as this made sense. However, he said, because of limitations with the system, I had to sign the documentation and pay at that point in time. I agreed on the contingent that he return and complete the work. He agreed to come the next day at 3 PM. I asked him about installing the sound bar, he said that it would need a bracket to be mounted.

  
The next day, Thursday, I was waiting for him at 3, however he showed up at 9 PM. He brought different anchors and attempted to install them into the wall with the mount. However, after installing the TV, the mount fell out of the wall, the top anchor ripping through the drywall. Luckily, he was holding the TV, so it was fine, but the anchor pulled right through the wall and left a hole where it once was. He then said that he would return the anchors to the store from which he bought them, and instead bring some other, more durable ones. He said he'd show up the next day, however we did not agree on a specific time. (It was also this day that he did in fact install my rear speakers into the wall without incident.)

  
Friday, he sent me a text in the middle of the day that he was going to pick up a better mount that would more evenly distribute the weight of the TV against more screws. I said this was fine, and asked when I could expect him. He didn't give me a time, so I communicated to him when I was leaving and when I was going to be back at home. By night time I sent him a message letting him know it was getting late and that it wouldn't work that day. He did not respond until the following day, Saturday, in the morning. He told me he would show up that day and asked me to pack up the old mount into its packaging.

  
Eventually, he arrived late Saturday night with the new mount. It was a fixed mount instead of the full-motion mount I paid for in the original invoice. However, at this point I was just happy to have something working. He drilled the holes into the wall, finally finding a stud by surprise while drilling. He installed the TV without connecting any cables, and then left.

  
He did not clean up any of the drywall dust or mount packaging after leaving, photos of which I'm attaching. Neither did he connect the TV to any cables. I went to go hook the TV up today and found that with the current mount, the cables push against the wall and prevent the TV from sitting against the mount securely, so I'll have to purchase low-profile cables to replace the ones I currently have in the TV.

  
So all in all, I paid for the following on my invoice:

* Full-motion TV mount - did not receive, ended up with a fixed mount
* TV mounting - was performed, but with multiple caveats above, and the wall behind the TV now has many holes in it and still has the old anchors in it from the first attempt at installation
* Power extension cord - did not receive
* Sound bar installation - was not performed
* Rear speaker installation - was performed

Some other fun quirks:

* He didn't bring his own hammer the first time. I offered him to use ours, no big deal. But I thought it was odd he never brought one on the subsequent visits and kept using mine.
* He took some of my mandarins. Honestly, I didn't mind. But it was weird that he took them first and then asked if it was OK.
* He grabbed an allen wrench kit out of my tools and tried using it without asking first.
* He rolled a joint in my kitchen (which admittedly, he asked if he could, and I said yes) and dumped some of the excess scraps into my recycle bin (which I did not say yes to). That's a first for me from a technician on the clock.

I would like a refund for the services which were not performed and cord which was not delivered, and if possible, at the very least some credit towards the TV mounting service, because of the issues described above.


I am attaching screenshots of my conversations with the technician, along with photos of the work in its current state.


I expect to hear from you soon.

Yesterday my mom, my sister, my girlfriend and I all went out to see Captain Marvel at our local AMC. My mom had ordered us all a large popcorn, dumped it into the little cardboard holders they have, that way we could all have our own. Everyone else headed into the theater but I headed back to get our free refill now that the main bucket was empty. This is when I saw the asshole, let’s call him Jim (sorry to any nice people named Jim). Jim was ahead of me in line obviously waiting for something. The worker behind the counter gets some food, calls out the order and hands it to the guy next to Jim. He then asks Jim:

Worker: “And you had the pretzel, right?”

Jim: “Yes”

Worker: “Okay, I’ll go make that for you.” And heads into the back to go get the man his pretzel.

Jim: “You’re just now going to go make it?!” 

The theater was quite crowded as Captain Marvel had just come out and it was the 8 o’clock showing. After Jim’s comment I instantly realized I was behind a rude and entitled customer. The worker comes back out with the pretzel still in its wrapper.

Jim: “Can you hurry it up?”

Worker: “I’m going as fast as I can.”

Jim: “Lose the attitude buddy.” in a condescending tone.

The employee just shakes his head and continues to make the pretzel.

Jim: “Yeah, keep shaking your head.”

After seeing how rude customers can be on this subreddit and how often the employees just have to take it, I decided to stand up for this guy.

Me: “Hey dude, just let the man do his job. Being rude isn’t going to make your pretzel cook faster.”

Jim turns around realizing I’m talking to him.

Jim: “I’ve been waiting here 12 minutes and am a paying customer, so back off.”

Me: “I’m just asking you to be respectful.”

Jim: “You should have just stayed out of this, but now you’ve interjected yourself into this situation.” He actually said it just like that.

Me: “Again, all I’m asking is you to be respectful to the workers.”

Jim: “You put yourself into this situation, now you have to deal with the consequences.” Jim getting in my face, balling up his fist.

Me squaring up. I’m only 5’5”  and 135 pounds so I’m not very intimidating. But I’m a cadet and just finished submission grappling and wrestled for 6 years. Jim was only 5’7” so I felt I could hold my own if he started throwing fists.
Me: “You’re really going to get kicked out over me.”

Jim: “I’m willing to go to jail.” Again, he really said this. He then looked down at my popcorn bucket and probably would have knocked it out of my hands had it not been completely empty. 

Me: “I’m not scared of you, I’m in the army.”

Jim: “Yeah, and? I was in the Air Force so back up.” Now I know I can hold my own (playful jab at my sister branch). 

At this point the bartender comes over.
Bartender: “What seems to be the problem here?”

Me: “This man just threatened to assault me.”

Jim: “I did not. How did I threaten to assault you.”

Me, taking a second to collect my words: “You said you were willing to go to jail over me.”

Bartender:”How about we just get you two apart and get you you’re food and a refill for your popcorn.” Looking at my empty bucket.

Jim: “What rank are you.”

Me: “I’m a cadet.”

Jim: “Where at?”

Me: “Xplace.”

Worker: “Here’s your pretzel sir.” Jim finally turns around and grabs his food. I sit my bucket down on the counter and the worker takes it.

Jim: “Hey future officer, you know you’re going to have to deal with enlist when you graduate.”

Me: “Yes, and I’m going to expect them to be more respectful than you.”

Jim”Yeah, they’re going to ass frag you .” And starts to walk away to his theater. And to anyone who doesn’t know what fragging the commander is, it is a term for throwing a grenade into the commanders tent to kill him because the enlist felt like he was going to get them killed for medals. Mainly only occurred in Vietnam. Needless to say, not a cool thing to imply.

I just shake my head and the worker brings me back my refill.
Me: “Thank you.”

Worker in a very stressed but sincere tone: “Thank you.”

Thankfully even though Jim and I were seeing the same movie, he was seeing it in a different theater. After the movie I went up to the bartender and thanked him for defusing the situation. He said it was no problem and that his coworker was an ex-cop and pointed out the two of us arguing. I didn’t ask why the coworker didn’t come over, I just assumed the bartender had seniority. The bartender then explained that Jim had come out and apologized and explained that he was going through a divorce and that’s why he was so worked up. I hope Jim learned to be more respectful despite his own personal problems.

And before anyone asks, neither Jim or I missed any of the movie as we both were seeing an 8 o’clock showing, (I saw the sign above where Jim walked in). I know this because  I only missed a couple of previews and Jim made it back to his theater first. And sorry for weird format, I’m doing this on my IPad. ",1,Man almost assaults me over a pretzel,28

I couple weeks ago I saw a good deal on a Dulce Gosto coffee machine. Normally they cost about 230 dollars in here, but this one was only 46 bucks, new and sold by BetterBuy and I happened to have been paid that very same day so I said ""Why not?"" and went for it.

I arrived at the store, asked for it and picked up a few of the capsules to go with it. When they offered the Nerd Skwad protection for 2 years at 8 bucks I agreed (specially 'cause I've had my share of screwed machines because of power outages). I paid and went home to try it out.

After 20 minutes there was no water coming out of the machine. I called Mescafe to try and sort it out, since it was a defect from manufacture. They kept me on call for about 2 hours doing tests and whatnot to make the machine run, but nothing helped. 

After summoning Satan at their instruction, they told me that the machine was faulty and they could send me a ""purge kit"" to try and fix it. It would arrive in 5 to 9 days and if that didn't work, they would send the machine to a tech to try and fix it. That would take AT LEAST another 15 days. And if all that didn't solve the problem, they would give me a discount to purchase another machine.

I tried to argue with them that the machine was bought an hour before my call. It was something wrong from manufacture and logic says they should take the faulty machine and give me a new one that actually works, not keep me waiting for a month and if all fails, offer a discount for me to spend more money on another machine that could turn out to be also faulty. But there was no way they'd change their minds. It was either that or just keep the machine that didn't work.

I just said f\*ck it (not to the lady on the phone, but to the company) and went back to BetterBuy. The guy that sold it to me recognized me when I walked in. I told him the whole deal and he just rolled his eyes telling me that Mescafe is always shitty like that and that it was a common defect. He took the box, checked that everything was there, went to get another machine, changed my ticket and I walked out with a new machine (that actually worked, I tested it).

Today I got a call from Mescafe to rate the customer service and I flat out told them that I wouldn't buy another thing from them ever again and that they should thank BetterBuy for understanding what customer service means and fixing Mescafe's mistakes.

I was sure that the bill without tip was $14-something, but the charge was for $20.72. I even asked my coworker who went with me and ordered the exact same thing, and he remembered it being $14-something.

I always round up to the nearest dollar to make it easy, so it should have been $3, and if you take off double that, it would have been $14.72. ($11 sandwich + $2.50 drink) * 1.09 = $14.72. So either I added really wrong, or the waitress messed up (or was scamming).

I called and talked to a manager, and explained it could totally have been my fault, but if it wasn't, I'd just like the $3 back. She was understanding, but then conversation got a little weird.

We walk in about 7:50pm expecting to wait a few minutes since we were early. the host greets us and immediately says we will have to wait a few minutes. we say no problem and talk amongst ourselves. about 8:15pm the host comes back and indicates her manager told her to tell us it will likely be at least another 10-20 minutes until we can be sat because the table we would be sitting at still had guests and all other tables were full. she walked away quickly before we could even respond.

i walked over to the host to find out why a table wasn’t ready for us and she said she would have to go ask her manager what was going on 

about 5 more minutes go by and host comes back and indicates that her manager has asked her to ask us if we could please wait over in the corner at a small bar area with a view of the kitchen because he didn’t want us waiting at the front. we indicated we would rather not and asked how much longer it would be if she was certain that table was getting ready to leave. at this point she admitted she actually didn’t know how long and would go get her manager. which is what she was supposed to be asking him in the first place. 

she comes back without her manager and indicates he said it could be up to 20 more minutes. at this point it was almost 8:30pm and we were all quite hungry and didn’t want to wait another 20 minutes to maybe get a table. we told the host as much and said we would just head somewhere else. she offered to go get her manger to speak with us and we indicated not to bother as it seemed he wasn’t willing to come over since he kept sending her back and not to worry about it. 

we put our coats on and headed out the door. as we were walking to our car the manager came running out to is asking why we were leaving. we explained we were not willing to wait almost an hour past our reservation time (it was already 8:30 and we were told it could be another 20 more minutes at that point) to maybe get seats and that in the future he should have been the one to approach us much earlier than this and to stop sending his host to tell us the bad news.

this is the first time that has happened there. and i understand if a table won’t leave what can you do but honestly as a manager he should have been speaking with us to try and rectify the situation rather than sending over the host to just keep telling us we would have to wait longer and trying to hide us in a corner to wait.

332,bittercynic,0,t3_azoygf,20,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/azoygf/the_bag_of_shrimp/,"This happened today and I am literally still processing it because I cannot understand this lady. I’ve worked retail before but I have never seen some just so… disconnected.

So I go into my local store to buy an absurd amount of flavoured water because that shit’s my jam. (I swear to God, these workers probably know me as ‘Crazy Water Lady’). There’s only about ten people in the store and only two registers are open.


(A side note, I was pretty pleased that all the people chose the first register. Why would I be happy about that? Because the other register was a handicap-accessible register (short counter with a wide aisle) and each person who came up behind me said some variant of ‘Oh, no, not that one, what if someone needs it, it's okay, I can wait.’ It’s a stupid thing but it made me smile.)


Anyway, what should be a short checkout was taking a very long time. I noticed in front of me, an older woman was arguing with the cashier.

She had a bag of shrimp. The bags of shrimp were currently on sale for like, 25% off. She was arguing that one of the big bags was (low price) and because she was only getting half a bag, she should only pay half of (low price).

I mean, I guess, that might sound _kinda_ reasonable. Until you look closer.

**This woman was holding a ripped-open, half-empty bag of shrimp.**

The cashier repeatedly told the woman that she can’t just get rid of half the bag and only pay for that half. The woman told her that she only wanted half so why should she pay for all of it? The conversation went like this:

Cashier: “You have to buy the whole bag.”

Lady: “I don’t want the whole bag.”

Cashier: “But you can’t do that.”

Lady: “I’m not paying that much. I don’t want that much shrimp.”

Cashier: “You can’t just get rid of some of it.”

Lady: “Get your manager.”

They ended up just letting the lady get away with it, manually changing the price in the register.

But here’s a question I never heard asked.

_Where’s the rest of the f*cking shrimp?_ 

WHERE IS IT? YOU GOT IN LINE WITH THE BAG ALREADY HALF-EMPTY. I KNOW THERE ARE NO TRASH CANS HERE FOR THE CUSTOMERS. WHERE DID YOU PUT IT LADY? WHERE DID YOU DUMP IT?! 

IS IT IN THE BATHROOM? IS IT ON THE FLOOR SOMEWHERE? **IT’S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IT’S NOT IN YOUR CART AND YOU DON’T HAVE A PURSE, _WHERE IS THE SHRIMP, LADY?_**

It’s been hours and I’m still thinking about it.

I am so sorry to everyone who works there.

TL;DR: Lady dumps half a bag of shrimp because she didn’t want to pay full price. I don’t know where the shrimp was left and I’m confused and frightened.

So I’m in the newsagency at our big local shopping centre. I’m looking for crossword puzzle books, and trying to decide which ones I want, and how many I can afford. I’ve recently been paid, so I’m thinking of buying two or three. 

Whilst I’m deciding on the ones I want, a sprightly little nana type steps up besides me and starts reaching for crossword books too. I ask if I can help her (I’m 5’8 and she’s about 4’1) and she is thankful. We start talking a little bit. We are both looking for one title in particular that isn’t in stock. She looks at my books, and says that they would only keep her busy for a couple of days. She loves her crosswords. I tell her that I do them in my downtime at my job. We both agree that doing crosswords helps to keep our brains working. 

As we are both on our way to the counter, she is lamenting how she really wanted the book that they didn’t have. That she’s had a shitty morning, having spent about 5 hours at the hospital in the palliative care ward. I didn’t want to ask her who she was with, but I could tell she was feeling upset and stressed. I asked if she had to go back, and she said that she was going home to have a very cold beer (Australia and seriously hot/humid) and do some puzzles. 

I’m paying one server whilst she is being looked after by another. I decided to buy a scratchie (lottery ticket thingy where you scratch off stuff to try and win money) and decide quickly that I would buy her one too. 

I paid for my puzzle books and the two scratchies and tapped her on the shoulder. I said something like “you could probably use some luck, so I hope you have a better afternoon than the morning you’ve had.” 

Dear Redditors, she gave me a hug and told me thank you. (I noticed that she was paying with small coins etc. to buy her books.)

This week I went back into the same store and got the book that I wanted that was missing the last time I was in. When I was at the counter paying, the lady serving me asked if I was in last week and gave a little old lady a scratchie. I said yeah, that was me. 

Apparently she had won $50! That made me so bloody happy!

This place sold pizza by the slice as well as whole pizzas. It was pretty busy in there but looked like most just grabbed slices. 

They listed all their pizzas on the board but I didn't see the one I wanted out on the ready-made display. When it got to our turn, I asked if they had the one I wanted available by the slice. She didn't answer my question, but mumbled something about having to stand at the next counter (which didn't even have another worker as she was the only one out front) if I wanted to order a whole pizza. It was clear that English wasn't her first language, so I repeated my question again (but worded differently). Again, she gestured to the other (empty) counter. Then she looked right past me and served the person behind us. 

This was when I started to get annoyed. My bf and I were still standing there, and she just ignored us. Bf and I just figured, since she didn't seem to understand, we'll just order whatever was on display after she's done with that other customer. But she continued to just ignore that we were still there and served another customer. 

So after this one, I got her attention again and just asked to order a couple slices of the pepperoni one. Again, she gestured to the other side and mumbled something about a whole pizza. I tried to tell her that we're not ordering a whole pizza, just a couple of slices. She stared at me blankly for a minute and then grabbed someone from the back to help us. I made the mistake of asking about the pizza on the menu again because it became clear that this other employee also didn't seem to understand English very well. So now they're both staring at me like I'm speaking an alien language. 

Finally just tried to order a couple slices of the pepperoni, using hand gestures and pointing. Finally got our order. All that, and the pizza wasn't even good.

I'm a chef so I always always always give the benefit of the doubt to restaurants. Shit happens, but if the food is good, I'll always give a place a second chance. Maybe there was a party, maybe they had a bunch of people and I got my order in before they could should off online ordering to help the kitchen. There is a million and one reasons and I keep that in mind. I also don't advertise that I'm a chef and try to avoid to bringing it up because it's a dick move and usually I end up getting more attention. I just want to enjoy someone else cooking for me while I hide the corner away from the other tables.

So I order from this local Indian restaurant because god damn is Indian food good. I ordered a non spicy version of something because I didn't feel like spice that day. The food was really spicy. Delicious, but not what I ordered. I ordered two different desserts because I've never had them and I'm a pastry chef. Damn straight I'm going to try both. They gave me double of one and forgot the other so I was bummed. Also, I found whole cardamom pods in my dessert. On one hand... they're using propper spices. On the other, I don't know if anyone has bit into a cardamom seed but 10/10 would not recommend.  It also took them  an hour to  just cook my food and some of this stuff, like the desserts are premade because of the nature of what they are. Where they really fucked up is that they marked my food as cooked which sends me an update but the delivery driver took 20 minutes to leave the restuarant. This to me means that they might have told her to wait as they finished the other to go orders and let my food get cold because it's first (give or take 5 minutes for lag). So I've been waiting for food for 2 hours before it finally comes and the order isn't correct. That being said, what I did get though cold, but was Damned. Good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left a 2/5 star lengthy reply that was very positive and listed out what was wrong, the benefit of the doubt, and that I would not order delivery again but was looking forward to coming back to the restaurant to try the food in house to give them another chance. After all, the food was *good.* It just wasn't what I ordered or paid for. I also like giving long reviews to explain any context and give as much information as possible. If I go in and eat when a massive party shows up without a reservation, and the service suffers, it's important for me to make sure people understand that. Maybe their service is great and I just so happened to show up when they got hit with a curve ball. Again, benefit of the doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

 The owner responded to my review asking for the delivery service, which is fair. He talked about how much better food is in house and how much better the service is in house. Which is fair but odd. Food for delivery should be as good as in house, but I get it. He's probably upset and deffensive. Then he said that **I needed to change my star count to accuratly reflect my review.** Like hold on there buddy.... my star count does reflect my review. You fucked up 2 parts of my order, I found a physical contaminant in my food, and it took you ages to make my food on a Thursday. I'd give you benefit of the doubt on a Friday or Saturday but Thursday? Like damn. I was going to visit you in house to change my review but I sure as hell am not trying you again now.

I went to customer service to see if I could get a refund, even though it clearly said on the box that once opened, refunds couldn't be issued.

This happened a couple of years ago, but amazing and I thought it was worth sharing and might be handy for others to know the possibility of this too.

So when I moved into my home I set up with an energy provider A and I set to pay the bill annually. New to all this so don't know how it works, but basically I signed up and then forgot about it, until over a year went by and I thought hmmm that's strange... Also in this time I was getting bills in the previous tenants names from the provider they used, B, which I would send back, but after the year went by I was getting a little nervous thinking still receiving these letters for energy company B for previous tenants. So I then decided to phone energy company A and say I have not received a bill yet for this this year and was wondering what was happening. They told me that it had been rejected to sign up with them as there was a bill from the previous occupants so it didn't go through, and I was still with company B technically. I was pissed at A as they hadn't even told me that I wasn't with them.

At this time I thought oh shit, thinking they are going to try and lump the old tenants bill on mine. I phoned up company B and they said that there was a bill for over £1300 and I would have to pay it, at least the amount I was living there from. I said fine, I'll find out the exact dates but I was annoyed as their gas was more expensive and I didn't sign up for it, but I was locked to any other energy company with the bill still outstanding.

So I found out the dates and phoned back and spoke to the coolest lady in the world, and explained what had happened and she said that my address could be two different addresses. I had noticed this on letters I had received as the area had been developed on there was a bit of a grey area on what could pass as my address. She said she will just put me down as the other dress she could use and the bill for me, even the gas I had used would be wiped clean. So I got a year's worth of free gas and she said the people running from the gas bill would have it on their name and would have to dispute and prove their tenancy to work out their gas bill, should it come to that. Thanks kind energy lady :)

TLDR:

Was able to wipe my energy bill because my address could be written in two different ways, and lady changed my address to the second one.

This was years ago, but i was recently reminded of it by my sister since she is getting married soon. 

I was at the mall with my sister shopping for a nude colored strapless bra to wear with my wedding dress. I was trying not to spend too much money because a strapless nude bra is just not something I would wear normally. After several stores, I was starting to get discouraged.   I’ve never found a strapless bra that fits perfectly. We were at a department store and my sister found those sticky bras. I thought that was a great solution, but wanted to try one more well-known-fancy-bra-store a try. There was only one package of sticky boobies in my size and in nude on the rack so I took it up the the counter in that section. I’ve shopped at this store many times and they will hold items until the end of the business day if you ask them. My conversation with the gruff lady (GL) behind the counter went as such:

Me: hello, can you hold these behind the counter until the end of the day? 
GL: these are non-returnable.
Me: ok. But could you hold these behind the counter for me until the end of the day please? They’re the last in my size.
GL: THESE ARE NON-RETURNABLE.
Me; Right. Yes. Ok. That’s not what I’m asking. Can you please just keep them behind the counter for me while I decide if I want them or not? 
Something must have clicked and I think she sort of understood what I was asking of her. 
GL: yeah, I can hold onto them, but only until the end of the day. 
Me: that would be great. Thank you. 

We ended up not going back because I found a bra that I liked that wasn’t also disposable. I also didn’t want to deal with the grumpy lady again. Prior to the interaction she had snapped at my sister and me about how many items we were allowed in the dressing room. (6) and she was watching us like a hawk the whole time.

I have a 12 pound dog that's part shit'zu and part schnauzer which instill domt know why anyone would intentionally combine those 2 breeds but shes adorable and I love her even if shes got her issues. Anyway, I find it difficult to bathe her myself and so I take her to get groomed when its necessary and have her fair trimmed down bc it looks nice  and it gets so hot where I live a lot. And it's fine. I get there and ask how she did and they mention she had to go to the in store vet bc something happened to her mouth which is fine.

Cuts she could've only gotten at the groomer and that had not been disclosed to me. And I'm not the kind of person that is going to demand a refund or anything unless the service is seriously wrong or something doesn't work. But I decided to call just to let them know I'm not okay ekth the fact I wasnt  told about the injuries. Like I signed a form that said vet care was allowed and I was to be told of any thing that went wrong. And the store couldn't fix the injury. They apologized and refunded the money. But my dog did wind up with an infection on her mouth for some reason I think ththe in store vet just isn't gold. Maybe. because I'm used to vets that have never harmed any of my dogs ever and have caught any issue I didn't even realize was a problem. 


Although JFK how you get out kf consenting to vet treatment at groomers bc if you say no your dog could bleed to death or something. 

But I still want pleased that when I asked how my dog did no one mentioned the 4 cuts on my dog's body. And that I found out about an infection from my actual vet later when at an appointment so he could look at her eye. Like own up to your mistakes, people.

Edit: Coeliac is the British English spelling for Celiac. Being Australian, we use that spelling too. 

My fiance works in a gluten-free cafe. Every single thing is gluten free, to zero per million.
This means the cafe is Coeliac-friendly to the highest possible degree. 

So imagine the shock of all employees when a lady (L) delves into her handbag, pulls out one slice of white bread with all the grace of me pulling my hand out of a pringles tube, and hands it to her child. 
Imagine the look of terror in the eyes of the owners (one of which has a yeast allergy) as the child puts this bread EVERYWHERE but their mouth. 
The other owner (O) rushes to their table; 

O: Sorry, I just need to ask if the bread is gluten free. 

L: What? Why? 

O: We can't have gluten products here, for the safety of our coeliac customers. 

L: Well he can't have gluten free food, what am I supposed to do? 

O: Oh, he... why? 

L: He's not gluten free. 


Firstly, a single slice of untoasted white bread is not sustenance for a child aged older than four, and it is certainly not breakfast. 
Second, your child should have been stopped from wiping it on the floor.
Next, your kid wouldn't be gluten free, he would be gluten intolerant.
Finally... can't eat gluten free food because he's not gluten intolerant? This isn't the way this works. It's like only eating 1kg of chocolate per day because you don't have diabetes or a root canal.

Context: 
I am of Asian Descent, woo, but I'm also mixed and come off as extremely vague. My friend who was with me is very clearly Korean. Me and her are both first year Uni students. 

So this happened over the summer, we were going to see this movie that I really had wanted to see for months. We go up, purchase our tickets, they ID us, cause it was Rated R. That's fine and it makes sense that they ID us while buying tickets right? 

So we were really early and we're waiting to go in, chilling, buying popcorn, cuddling at a table,  (we're just very close, but we do get asked if we're dating a lot. Did this play a role? Idk maybe), and my friend gets a call from one of her parents. She starts speaking in Korean to her mom and by this time the movies gonna start soon. So we get up and go to the ticket tearer guy to go into the theatre. As that's what one does. 

So we go in, walk towards the theatre-  and the manager stops us. 

M-Manager 
B- Friend 

M: Can I see your ID? 
Me: Uhm... sure? 

See I was confused cause I've never been asked if I was younger than I am. Plus in my shoes I was pushing 5'10"" and I had on makeup which instantly ages me up. 
So I hand this guy my ID again. 

M:Ok go on. 
So I go to walk away and he calls me back a g a i n . 

M:actually wait may we see your ID again? 
Me: Sure.  

He takes like a full ass minute to stare at it. 
And I'm lowkey like. Why are you tripping? Its a fucking movie, even if its R, kids go in all the fucking time dude. But whatever. 
He gives it back and calls my friend back and asks for B's ID. 

B: //hands him her UNI ID// 

M: we can't accept this.

B: why not its what I used when I bought the ticket? 

M:well you can't see this movie its for adults, you can go over to the service desk and exchange it for a pg-13 ticket. So unless you have something with a picture and your age then I can't let you in. 

B: well do you want a picture of my passport? Or me to log into my student account for my college? 

M: nono those won't work. Do you have your green card on you or something like that? 

And at this point Im like bruh. Its a fucking m o v i e. Even if she's 17 its fucking fine. Stop power tripping. Also B was born in the US. So like wtf. 

M: and You //to me// can't buy her a ticket since youre under 21 right?  

B just rolls her eyes and goes over to the service desk and trades her ticket for a pg 13 one thats the same fucking price. By this point the movie has started. This is important because per this theatre's policy we now can't get refunds. 

So we both stop in the bathroom and just sigh cause that was such a fucking hassle and was fucking weird. At this point we don't think it was a race thing. 

We walk into the original movie we planned to and get stopped by security. 

They sent security after us. And security had been watching us for up to 7 full ass minutes. 
So now I'm irritated. Like really irritated. So I just say fuck it and tell B that I refuse to stay here another fucking minute. 
And I'm also wondering , Security didn't follow us into the bathroom, so how did they know after like 5 minutes to follow us specifically. And why are they so fucking hung up on it??? 
Then I realize. This entire theatre is full of only white people. I don't even want to make it a race thing but deadass. All the workers were white. All the people in the lobby were white.  This mall is a very high end mall in general with stores like Gucci and Neiman Marcus and in general minorities aren't typically there. 

So B calls her mom and tells her that we're just gonna go to her house now and rent a movie. All in Korean. Very angry and very loud Korean in the lobby. And the manager is looking over at us in concern. A different security guard comes up to us to gently shoo us out. LIKE SERIOUSLY. I am 5'6"", 5'10"" in heels, wearing a dress and a pink letterman jacket. My friend is 5'4"" 100 lbs soaking wet . A 6' 1"" security guards comes up to us and looks really uncomfortable. 

SG: Your dress is very nice. 
Me://bland smile// thanks

I'm watching the ticket tearing station and see a group of white kids getting their tickets torn, no double ID checks. Now I don't know what movie they were seeing but at this point I'm pretty sure that I know the reason why we were being singled out. 

SG:.... 
Me: She's just finishing her call. 
SG: Ok then... //awkward hovering// 

B finishes her call and hangs up and immediately starts talking about how stupid this is, and how they're being wholly unfair to people who don't have driver's licenses. And who carries their passport everywhere??? So me and her are chatting about Our other friend Mikey who is an immigrant and how he, despite being a year older than us, would also totally be screwed. 
Now the thing about me is in general I'm pretty chill. But this shit got me fucked up. F u c k e d u p.

So I decided to pull a Draco Malfoy ""my father(cough cough mother) will hear abt this!"" and call my mother who happens to be a lawyer as we walk towards the door. 
And as she answers I immediately go into rant mode, describing our unnecessary scrutiny and the general rudeness very loudly as the door closes. 

This is not where the story ends actually but that happens later that night, when my mother who is a lawyer shows up(without my prompting mind you). If anyone wants to hear that lmk 

Oh! And literally the next day me and B went to the same theatre, different mall, and bought our tickets, with her Uni ID and saw the fucking R rated movie fucking fine. No extra checks or bullshit. ",1,Racist Theatre,27

There was already a customer in front of me making his order and it was obvious it was his first time ordering milk tea as he was asking them lots of questions about the menu. 

He took about 5 minutes to order after which I placed my order. We were both standing off to the side waiting for our drinks:

Customer will be 'Muppet', I will be me and the store staff will be 'Staff'

Staff: \*Calls out my drink order\*

Muppet: \*Barges in front of me\* YES! That's mine!! 

Staff: \*Looks at me\* That was your drink wasn't it?

Me: Yep, pretty sure the other guy grabbed the wrong order.

Staff: \*Sigh\* Sorry I'll remake it for you.

5 minutes pass and I see the Muppet power walking back to the store with the drink in his hands. Note that he has already finished drinking 3/4 of the large drink he took. Here we go:

Muppet: \*Pushes in line and storms to the counter\* Excuse me!!! This is the wrong drink, I didn't order this!! 

Staff: No, it's not, but it's your fault because you took the wrong order.

Muppet: It's not my fault!! You gave it to me, you should've known it's not what I ordered. Now I would like you to remake my drink.

Staff: Sir, you've already finished drinking 3/4 of your drink. If you knew it wasn't your order, why did you drink so much of it?

Muppet: Excuse me?? I didn't realise it wasn't my drink until I had drank some of it, it's not my fault you gave me the wrong drink!! 

Staff: I'm sorry but you have drank almost all of it. I can't make a new one for you unless you pay for it.

Muppet: I'm not paying for a new one!! This is ridiculous, this isn't what I ordered and you need to make MY drink for me. It's not my fault you can't do your job!

Staff: \*Getting agitated\* Sir, you're being ridiculous! You can't demand a new drink after you've already nearly finished this one. If you give me back a full drink I'll make you a new one of charge, but you can't do that can you? 

Muppet: What do you want me to do? Vomit it out??

Staff: \*Clearly pissed off at this point\* Don't you dare vomit on my counter!! This is the end of the conversation, I'm not giving you a free drink. 

At this point I got my drink and started to leave. The muppet was still standing in front, blocking the long line forming behind him and continued arguing with the staff. I spoke more about this story in my podcast, but I wanted to hi-five the staff there so bad!! It's so rare to see staff hold their ground and not give in to stupid customer demands. Kudos to them!

Thing is it’s not cheap (to me), it costs more than £20 for the basic test and another £10 on top for the scans. 

I don’t have much money, I work in service myself and live pay check to pay check in general. I was dreading how broke I was going to be as it was another week until payday. 

When I ended up needing a tiny prescription in reading glasses, I wasn't sure if I should even get some at first. But I was hoping my head would somehow hurt less so I decided I would give it a try. I took a pair to you to order and pay. You were friendly and we chatted a bit, I asked you about your day and how work was, and told you I was working that night and all weekend. We sympathised together. You work weekends too. 

You talked me through the options and offered me the extras. I quietly admitted that I was trying to spend as little as possible because it was already more than I expected to pay for (£21 for the test + £10 scan + £25 glasses). I couldn’t afford to spend another £30 on anti glare when I was buying the cheapest glasses available. You nodded understandingly. 

Lowering your voice you mentioned that I could go online and find a voucher code for £10 off. You waited patiently while I frantically looked online, you tried to give me a hint as to what it might start with, like you knew the first few letters. I think my face fell because I simply couldn't find it. I was too anxious about how long I was taking. 

""Done!"" You said. 

I asked what you meant. You said you just put it in from memory, with a wink. I couldn't thank you enough for your kindness. When I went to pay the bill I saw that not only was there £10 off but you left off the scan too. Instead of almost £60 I ended up paying about £35. I felt like crying to be honest!

I can only imagine you get some unpleasant customers who don't give the time of day, as I  often do at work. I know when I'm the one handling customers, that even just one person treating me like a human can make my day. 

So thank you, for helping me out.  it meant so much to me. I hope you are treated well by every customer you see!

Warning: Lot's of swearing. If curse words offend you, this is not the story for you. 

Here we go.

About an hour ago my boyfriend and I went to a popular fried chicken place. This location is notoriously busy, as it's small and has a drive thru.

We waited in line behind three or four people. All was normal until a woman who had already ordered shouted, ""Can you hurry up with my fries?!"" Let's call her CL for Crazy Lady. 

I felt bad for the staff, but rude customers are part of the job. The cashier(C) apologized and I saw her put the box of fries into the bag. I figured that would be the end of it. It was not. 

CL: ""Don't you fucking touch my fries, bitch! I saw you! I work in health and you need to wear gloves!""

C: ""I didn't touch your fries, miss. They're in a box.""

CL: ""You touched the box! It's contaminated!""

Not sure what to do, the cashier just handed the bag to crazy lady.

CL: ""Where's my fucking spoon?!""

C: ""You ordered fries, miss. I didn't know you needed a spoon.""

CL: ""Don't you tell me what you think I fucking need, bitch! It's my life! You don't know me! I want a spoon! But don't fucking touch it with your dirty hands!""

By this point the manager(M) had heard the commotion and came rushing over. 

M: ""Can I help you?""

CL: ""Your bitch touched my fries and won't give me a fucking spoon! Fuck her and fuck you!"" Crazy lady opened her box of fries and threw a handful at them. 

M: ""You know what? No. Fuck YOU!"" Until now all of the other customers including myself had kept our heads down, but at that we all started laughing. This upset crazy lady. 

CL: ""Fuck me?! Fuck all y'all!"" 

The manager told her that she needs to calm down and treat her and her employee with respect. Crazy lady wasn't having it and demanded her money back, all the while dropping a bunch of derogatory terms. The manager agreed, but said it would take a minute as she paid with a card, and they had to follow protocol. The manager told the cashier to take the next customer while she dealt with crazy lady. 

CL: ""No! Not until I get my money back! You can't serve anyone else until I get my fucking money!"" She physically blocked any other people from reaching the cash, while screaming about 'her rights'. 

A random guy in line then chimed in. ""Lady, I have to get to work. Just let the next person go!""

CL: ""I work too! Fuck you, you'll wait! They have to give me my money!""

This went on for about five more minutes. Crazy lady kept on swearing, threw more food and a straw at the staff. She also made a phone call, either to her work or the police? It was hard to tell, she just kept saying they wouldn't give her her money (even though they were trying to refund it). 

Crazy lady finally got her money, but before she left she grabbed a calculator that was by the cash and whipped it at the staff. As she stormed out she told them to ""watch their backs"". 

I have never seen someone act like this, I felt so bad for the staff. I was so happy the manager stood up to her though. There's too much of that ""the customer is always right"" bullshit, sometimes the customer is just an asshole and needs to be told so.

For those who don't know, the store this takes place in is a British store that buys cds, dvds, phones, consoles, games etc. Its quite popular as its a fast way to sell stuff at a reasonable price.
Kind of a long post so tl:dr at bottom

This took place in December, around a week before Christmas. I had always wanted to play super mario 64 and ocarina of time on the original hardware after playing the remakes on the ds, and as luck would have it, one of the cex stores sort of near me had an n64 console in stock. Now me being young i didn't really know much about old consoles. For those who don't know, an n64 has a small slot on the top of the console for an expansion pack to be placed in, this increased the performance of the console and allowed you to play some games that require it. N64's didn't ship with an expansion pak, but instead a jumper pak which acted as sort of a bridge as the console cant function without something in the spot.

When i arrived at the store and stood in the stupid long line, i asked to see the console and the body was in quite good condition. I decide to purchase it and all is well. The store didn't happen to have any boxed n64 games, and i wanted to only get the games boxed. Thankfully there was another store in the town that specialised in retro games and consoles. Heading there, i check out their games and they have ocarina of time, i flag down the employee to get it out, and strike up a conversation

Me - ""hi, i just bought an n64 and was hoping to get some games, i would like to take a look at ocarina of time please""

Employee - ""sure no problem, just fyi, did you check the expansion slot?""

Me - ""no, what's the expansion slot""

Employee - ""the expansion slot allows you to install an expansion pak, which increases the power of the console, but people have a history of removing the original jumper pak that ships with all n64 consoles. Without it the console wont run.""

I get the console out of the bag and show it to him. Sure enough, no jumper pak or expansion pak.

Employee - ""yeah this n64 wont run, also they've given you an s-video cable, and that likely wont be on many modern TVs""

He gets one of the n64's out of the display case and shows me the jumper pak.

Me - ""oh no, ill head back and get a refund""

They had an n64 for sale in the store so i had decided i would get a refund and buy it from there instead.

I return to the store and wait again in the long as hell queue until they call next.

Me - ""hi, I just bought an n64 from here about 20mins ago, but theres no jumper pak inside.""

Employee 1 - ""and, what is the problem""

Now one thing to note, the store used to be very good for buying retro consoles, however since they have gotten bigger, they could no longer just hire people with knowledge on gaming.

Me - ""well, its unusable, it wont work without a jumper pak or expansion pak.""

Employee 2 - ""i had an n64 growing up, you don't need a jumper pak.""

Employee 1 - ""I'm sorry but we cant offer a full refund, only a partial one, or store credit.""

The store offers two trade in options, one for cash which gets you less money, or store credit which will get you more money, but can only be used to purchase things in one of their  stores.

At this point I'm astonished that they would respond like that.

Me - ""but it wont work, you have sold me a product that cannot be used!""

Employee 2 - ""no it will work fine, i had one as a kid.""

I get my phone out and try to show them the Wikipedia entry on the n64 that states they need a jumoer pak to function. They take no notice

Employee 1 - ""I'm sorry kid but that's all i can offer you.""

Me - ""alright then, if youre so sure that it will work without a jumper pak, prove it, show me it working and ill leave.""

I hand the employee the console and he takes it back and sets it up

... Nothing, there is absolutely nothing on the screen (they did have a game inserted)

The employee came back over to me.

Employee 1 - ""as a gesture of good will, we will refund the money in full""

That made me so happy

I could've been snarky or said something horrible, but i was tired and wanted to go home.

I head back over to the other store and bought an n64 with a jumper pak and ocarina of time, and it also had composite cables which is lucky because all the TVs we had didn't have s-video, only composite.

At that point in my life I owned about 1,600 volumes of manga. This included really rare series such as From Far Away, Boys Over Flowers, Please Save My Earth and much more. I began collecting Red River when I was 16 years old and had worked for years trying to get each book in the 28 book long series. I had to spend $75 on volume 15 and order volume 16 from the UK for $50. I was trying not to go over a $280 budget and had spent a total of $270 on the series at this point.

Volume 3 was the ONLY volume I needed to complete my 4th favorite series of all time. A full set in English is worth $450-$500 on Ebay. I went online to buy volume 3 only to see that the price of the volume had risen due to supply and demand. There weren’t many copies to choose from and a new copy had just become worth $75. I purchased a used in like new copy from a third party seller for $24. This was $14 over the original MSRP value.

So I am waiting and waiting AND WAITING until finally it’s been a month. Now usually what happens when I get scammed is that I get a book in a falsely advertised condition and either 1. Send it back if it’s too bad, 2. Ask for a partial refund or 3. If it’s not worth returning I just write bad reviews for each bad book sold.

NOPE, not this seller!!!

I went online and it says that it was shipped; I went to their page to message them and notice a whole slew of awful reviews about this seller being a scammer. Particularly reviews saying that they gave out false tracking numbers. I went frantically back to my orders and realize that they used a fake tracking number. THEY NEVER EVEN SHIPPED MY ITEM OUT!

I message them immediately complaining that I hadn’t received my item and wanted a refund. They surprisingly gave me the refund although they lied and said it had been lost by my mail man. They then offered to either give me a free book, free CD or a free gift card for messing up my order. I was surprised to get such a nice offer however I still didn’t trust this seller. I choose to get a free book obviously.

Despite offering a free book they tried to pressure me into choosing gift card instead. I would never trust this seller to legitimately give me a gift card worth anything more than $5 so a free book was far more worth it. I tried to choose a manga just as rare as Red River volume 3 as pay back. I followed their directions and placed an order for the book I wanted. They never accepted my order. I tried again 2 more times and then contacted them.

They told me to send them SKU’s of the books I wanted so I looked at their seller profile, saw all of the books they had for sale and gave them the SKU’s. Every time I gave them an SKU they REMOVED the book from the website and told me it was “no longer for sale”.

At this point this seller was just harassing me. I finally gave them an SKU for a volume of manga they had listed for $700; Rave Master volume 28. They removed it 5 minutes later and told me it was no longer available. I GAVE UP. I was DONE with this online seller or should I say sellers since during the entire email correspondence I couldn’t even get a hold of the same sales rep each time. It was always a different person and their English was very bad. When I got the money back I got volume 3 for $16 on Ebay instead. As for the seller I reported them and left a horribly negative review.

They then harassed me to remove my review, NOT HAPPENING! They paid money to get my review removed and I messaged them to put it back up since it was my right as a customer to give them feedback on the website. They ignored me so I called this websites customer service group for the THIRD time on this seller. I demanded to speak with higher up.

  When I spoke on the phone I was told that the seller would be put under investigation and that there was nothing else they could do. They then gave me 50% off of anything I wanted being sold by the company that owned the website. I got a box set with 22 volumes; $222 worth of manga for only $40 since they already sold this set 50% off. I got 75% off of this set in total.

Unfortunately the seller is still selling on the site but they have to constantly delete negative reviews and create fake positive reviews. The have an 88% rating.

NOTE: Thank you everyone for the love! Also I forgot to mention this however, when I got my refund the seller re-listed the book I was supposed to get on the same site for $45.",1,"Third party seller tries to scam me two times, I get what I need for cheaper and get 50% off from the website's company as an apology.",163

Up in menswear I found some pairs of gloves hanging from a rack, but oddly none of them had the usual barcode/price labels. No problem, I'll just take this grey pair to the till and hope they can find them in their system. I didn't mind about the lack of price info as they'd obviously only be a euro or two. 

I get to the till and the cashier says ""oh no, these come as a double pack, you need to get &lt;mumble&gt; pair"". So I went back to the gloves rack, hunted again for a pair with a barcode/price label, but again no luck. So I just picked another grey pair and returned the till.

Cashier this time says ""oh no, you need to get a black pair, it's a grey pair and a black pair together"". OK, whatever, I'll go back again and find a black pair. And on getting back to the gloves rack, I find there are no black pairs. And then I realise: NOBODY wants to get two pairs of gloves, so guys just discard the grey pair and take the black pair which has the barcode to the till.

Kim wanted to do a little shopping while she was here and pick up a few things that she couldn't find in CO so she and our other sister head down to 125th street in Harlem.

BB: You didn't give me my 40% off from the sale.

SG: You gave me coupons for X% off I applied those

BB: Yeah and you forgot the 40% off

SG: No, I didn't, you can't use both, its one or the other.

BB: Why can't i use both?

Girl shows her the coupons and points out where is says \***CANNOT BE COMBINED WITH OTHER OFFERS,** then points to the sales sign where it also states \***CANNOT BE COMBINED WITH OTHER OFFERS.**

BB: Today's the last day of the sale

SG: Ok so I can take off the coupons and apply the sale price.

BB: The coupons expire today, can't you just let me use both?

SG: No, I'm not allowed, it's against company policy.

BB: The coupons are going to be useless if I don't use them today

SG: So use the coupon

BB: I don't understand why you just can't let me use both

SG: The register won't put through both codes, *it's not up to me.*

Que the infamous ""I want to speak to your manager!""

Apparently the manager was standing behind the counter watching the whole time while she was going through some paper work. SG looks at M.

M: What's the problem?

BB: This GIRL won't give me the sales price

M: I saw, you used coupons

BB: SO, why can't I use **both**?

M: I saw SG explain to you it can't be done. company policy, you can't combine offers unless stated. And both your coupon and the sale sign clearly state that they CANNOT be combined.

BB: WHY NOT?!

Now this is the part that Kim was not expecting,

M: (rolling her eyes, places hand on her hip): **DO I LOOK LIKE LYNN BRADLY TO YOU LADY!?**

Realizing she wasn't going to get what she wanted, BB huffed and walked out, leaving her coupons behind.

My dad is legally blind and any kind of bright lights hurts his eyes so going to stores was basically torture. He wears sunglasses even inside. He also has  neuropathy in his feet making it painful if he had to stand for too long. We were only getting a few things but since it was Friday and before a holiday the store lanes (all two of them that were open) and the self checkout were all full. However, there was a cashier in the makeup department (for some reason there's a register there) and only one other person was checking out. She had only a few things so my dad knew that he could wait. We were told during a previous visit that we could use this line.

In comes Blonde Line Jumper or BLJ.

BLJ - Can I go in front of you?

D - No.

BLJ - I only have a few things.

D - I don't care. I'm disabled and need to sit down soon.

BLJ - You don't look disabled.

Me - He's blind.

D - The light hurts my eyes.

Me- Leave us alone. We only have a few things. You can wait just like everyone else.

At this point the person the older woman in front of us is done and she probably heard our conversation because she glares at BLJ but doesn't say anything. This is where the line jumping comes in. Like I said, Dad has  neuropathy  and doesn't move too fast. Because of this BLJ took the chance to cut in front of us. The cashier (C) wasn't having it.

C - BLJ, they were here first. You can now go to the end of the line.

Three other people had lined up behind us.

BLJ - They said I could go first. I only have two things.

C - No they didn't. Now go to the back.

BLJ moved so that she was behind us.

C - I said the back.

BLJ left and went toward Customer Service. I don't know if anything came out of that because we left soon after that. Dad was struggling to stand at this point and it was obvious that that he was in pain. I thanked the cashier and paid for our four items.

377,CharlesNeverInCharge,0,t3_awttkd,2,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/awttkd/told_off_by_the_tailor_medium/,"I’ve been using the same dry cleaner near my house for over ten years.  I usually stay and chat with the ladies that work there and often help out one of the women that works behind the counter whenever she needs something typed up and printed since she isn’t great with computers. A few weeks ago I decided to bring all the items from my closet that needed mending to the tailor in this dry cleaner. I haven’t ever used the tailor there before.  I dropped everything off (dress with ripped seam, dress that needed new elastic in the waist band, and a dress that had a broken hardware on the adjustable strap). For the latter,I had ordered the ring to attempt to do it myself, so I left a new ring with the tailor when I dropped  it off.  When I say ring, think of an adjustable bra strap with a ring that the strap doubles through.  There is also a slider that you move up and down.  These are collectively “the hardware” for purposes of this tale.

I was surprised, after picking the finished dresses up and bringing them home, to discover that the tailor hadn’t just replaced the ring, but changed out all the hardware on both straps from clear pieces to milky white, which looked cheap and terrible on the black dress. Also, one of the new rings was broken. I brought the dress back yesterday, pointed out the still-broken ring, and asked the tailor if he could just use clear hardware to match the original dress when he redid it. He responded by literally calling me a liar, angrily saying that there was no way that he would have replaced all the hardware instead of just the broken ring, and insisting multiple times that I explain why he would have done that. He seemed fixated on arguing about these points, even though they were irrelevant since the dress needed to be redone because it was still broken and the hardware could have been easily changed out at that point. It was so ridiculous that I actually googled a picture of the dress for sale online to show him the original dress and my online order for clear plastic rings. There were more denials and obscenities muttered under his breath before he returned to his sewing machine and proceeded to ignore me. I finally just grabbed the dress and left.  The woman that works on the dry cleaning side (not the owner) texted me, apologized, and told me she would send it out to another tailor and refund me for the cleaning that they charged me for the dresses but hadn’t been done.  And the total cost of the job he did on the dress? $8. I felt better after going home and posting a review to their FB, yelp, and google pages about his behavior (I also mentioned that the other employee offered to send the dress out to another tailor). I wasn’t upset about the dress since it can easily be fixed, but the reaction was way beyond not okay. Also, I found the dress online last night for 70% off and bought it because I’m not sure I have the emotional energy to fix the dress at this point.

Edit to update: The owner of the cleaner contacted me today. When we spoke, he said that everything that I had said in my review was validated by the other employee present. He did everything I wanted him to do without prompting: apologized for the behavior, shared that it wasn't the only incident with this guy, and offered to pay for the dress/ credit my account, whatever, which I told him absolutely wasn't necessary but that I appreciated the offer. He didn't mention my online reviews other than to say that was how he had learned about the incident over the weekend, but I offered to, and did, take them all down. So, I'll put down my pitchfork.",1,Told off by the tailor [medium],30

So this happened a few years back. I was in Salem on a field trip with my English class. I was really looking forward to this since I got to spend all day with my amazing English teacher (we’re still great friends to this day). So our class was about to go to a reenactment of  the trial of Bridget Bishop, the first person to get accused of witchcraft, when I notice a burrito place. Not one to pass up a burrito, I go in.

In the shop, there are two of my classmates and a slightly older man. Because I’m in a rush, I politely ask him if I can go in front. He was nice enough to let me, and I go to order my burrito. This burrito guy is on the younger side, looking to be in his 20’s. So I get my burrito and noticed that they had a thing where if you’re wearing the color of the day, you get 5% off. So I ask.

Me: What’s the color of the day?

Burrito Nazi: Nothing you’re wearing.

Now normally I’d drop it after that, but I was wearing a tie dye shirt and a rainbow scarf that I had knitted myself. 

Me: But I’m wearing so many colors!

And this burrito nazi explodes. He starts going off about how I’m rude, my parents did a terrible job raising me, and kids these days are terrible. I’m shocked. I had no idea why this guy was yelling at me, so I try to interject. To which the burrito nazi hands me my burrito and says “F*ck you, get out of here.”

I am shocked beyond belief. So I go out and tell my teacher what happened, and she wanted to go in and tell the guy off. But we had a play to go to, so we wait until after the play. So we go back and talk to the employees. The burrito nazi wasn’t there, but I manage to get my money back and the employees promised to talk to the burrito nazi. So there ends my tale of the worst customer service I’ve ever had. And in case you’re wondering, the burrito was disgusting.",1,I get yelled at by a burrito guy,649

My friends are confused as to why I’d order just plain bacon so they asked me as that guy who brought it out to me was walking away. I said, without thinking, “It was supposed to be on my burger.” 

Guy turns around and gives me the dirtiest look ever. He stares me down like how dare I make that comment. He tells me “I’m the only cook in the back and I’m getting [x amount] of tickets at a time.

I just answered their question.

So my husband and I were out yesterday at the gym and both of us grew very hungry. Our town has a ton of fast food places and only 2 or 3 sit down and eat places. One of which is very expensive for 2 full time college students. So we go to this little family owned pizza joint down the road from the gym. 

We sit and order or drinks and quickly look over the menu. We ordered 2 calzones. 1 alfredo style, and 1 Hawaiian style (long live the debate of pineapples on pizza, or in this case, in a calzone) and waited for our food. We also got an appetizer since we were starving. 

Everything was fine until 30 minutes later when we received our over cooked, burnt mozzarella sticks. We were upset but decided to eat them anyways because our server was no where to be found and no one else came into the dining room of the restaurant. Keep in mind, it was only me and my husband and 1 other small party there. 

Another hour goes by and we finally receive our calzones. Mine is completely burnt to a crisp and the bottom of my husbands is pure black. We wait for our server to come back but to no avail. She disappeared. 

I decided to cut mine open and eat the insides, seeing as the bread is completely burnt and hard as rock, and my husband does the same. We’re both annoyed and a little angry at this point and we only eat half of it. Then we sit and wait another 45 minutes just to get our server and get our check. 

20 minutes later. here she is with the check and we are able to complain about our completely burnt food and she says she will talk to the manager, which only gave 20% off my calzone (so $1.80 off the entire bill). We were ready to just leave so we took it anyway. She ran the card and brought the receipt to us. My husband (who was paying) noticed she upcharged is $10 and went off to find her. I’m completely pissed at this point. 

an hour later, our server comes back after talking to the manager and gives us a voided receipt where she voided the payment and needed to rerun the card for the new total. So we give her the card and she’s off. 

We notice, she’s only refunding $21 of the $39 from the voided receipt and now we’re furious. I get up to find the manager but end up just coming back because I can’t find her and finally our server is back. We explain everything to her and she has to go fix it again.

Thankfully, we finally got everything sorted out and we left in a hurry and didn’t leave a tip. We vowed to never go back there again. I even asked to speak directly to the manager but the manager refused to come speak to us about what was happening with our food and our bill.

Okay, medium backstory because I feel that it’s relevant to paint this important picture the right kind of shit-color it is. I frequent thrift stores because I love finding great items on the cheap, and I have been going to this one particular thrift store for over 10+ years. It was my first thrift store, right down the street from my childhood home. A LOT of my childhood has been spent in and around that store and no one has ever harassed me like they did yesterday.. And certainly not by 5 separate people. I’m not a very outgoing towards strangers type of person, but I’m not awkward and know how to navigate a situation if someone is to randomly talk to me. I also hate tedious small talk, so my genuineness and interest can only be faked for so long. So any way, going into the ups and downs of this SA visit..

I like books, a lot. So as I’m shopping for books, suddenly Musty-Smell Bootleg Willie Nelson appears out of nowhere and begins to talk about his dislike of our current president in America. I agree ( I know, a public social taboo here ) and try to get him to see that I am currently using my time to shop for books, not talk. He goes on for 20 minutes about same topic regardless. Okay, cool, he’s lonely, I’ll entertain one stranger. Seems I’m not getting any more books for my collection today, I see. His daughter wearing some absolutely amazing iridescent rain boots comes over and tries to rap it up. Doesn’t work, she ends up talking with me as well to be polite. I can feel how forcibly polite we are being even though we are having a decent conversation regardless. 20 more minutes later ( I checked ) I escaped that section. Down the men’s aisle for flannels I go! Again, SUDDENLY, a man of Chad descent ( he told me ) stopped me and asked with his thick accent, “Do you believe, in philosophy?” So I learned his views, shared little of mine, nodded my head a lot, shook his hand.. And finally, 20 minutes later ( checked again ) he allowed me passage. Fine, no flannels today, I guess. Maybe I can regroup in the Knick-knack section? I go there, only to hear one small, Danny DeVito looking man screaming at another, much older man, and a small female employee. I wonder if you’re wondering why he’s so agitated. It’s because he’s against vaccinations (GREAT wOw) and yeah, enough said. I walked around a bit, but I was kind of pissed off at this point, and I hate ignorant, belligerent people like that. I hate how stupid anti-vaxxers are, never going to be sorry. So, I decided to rescue the old man and employee from his stupidity. As soon as I walked up and started sarcastically laughing over his words to break his attention, female employee locks eyes from me and just fucking runs. Okay, good, but the old man is just sputtering responses even as I begin to start asking him to come with me, just leave the dumb guy alone.. So, anti-vaxxer comes at ME. Saying how stupid I am, how he has a law degree he got 30+ years ago, how his son is a doctor and he says it’s true blah blah bullshit. None of that was true, probably, and Sir if your kid was a doctor he would get his licensure revoked just like the original ex-doctor that vaccinations cause birth defects. In fact, in the last 10 years or so, I’m sure that man went to the doctor and got vaccines, which people seem to forget.. So as I finally get the old man who now looks like he’s about to have a spasm from arguing so hard away, the idiot screams at us, “I hope your children get autism! And I hope your children’s CHILDREN, get the autism!!” lol ok bye guy cya. To wrap it up, the old guy I saved, actually turned out to be kind of an asshole. Even after I explained why I got him away ( for his safety ) he proceeded to talk to me about the Auto-whatever in Germany and cars and things he finally realized I didn’t care about, partially because I didn’t and mostly because my eyes kept drifting to the cute fish-shaped kitty dish on the shelf behind him. He also decided to, unprompted, tell me what a proud Trump supporter he is because of all the great he’s done for the stocks of his VA. Selfish, dumb old bastard. I regret helping him. He finally let me go after about 30 minutes of the combined previous encounter, and just half the time with him talking. My politeness was spent. I paid for my thrifty haul and went the fuck home.

Also, the lady we was harassing turned out to be the manager. I advised them to call the police before I left because he was a nuisance picking aggressive fights with other customers, but they didn’t care. Whatever. Humans all suck, even me.

TL;DR: I regret coming out of my hermit hole for the week because I got told by someone they hope my kids get autism, learned about philosophy and got both sides of the political spectrum in my country that I’m sick of hearing about.

I was not old enough to be left on my own and it was not a school day, so I had to come to the supermarket with my parents to buy food. Whenever I did this, I liked to attempt to find the items on our shopping list before my parents could. My memory of this incident is a little fuzzy, but for some reason I distinctly remember that the item on the shopping list that we were looking for next was vinegar.

Anyway, we went down the wrong aisle for vinegar, which gave me the perfect chance to beat my parents to it. I noticed that it was on the next aisle, so I ran round the corner and the following events occurred:

&gt;*(IW pushes me away)*

&gt;*IW:* He tried to shout at me! If he shouts at me, I'll shout at him. That's how it works.

Over the years, I've outfitted a great number of tool boxes from pawn shops for pennies on the dollar.  I got really tired of the thieves at TSA helping themselves to my shit in my checked bags.  So I stopped carrying tools when I travel, I hit a pawn shop and gear up when I get to the gig.   After the gig, I either abandon my kit or I check it and don't get to upset when it gets stolen.  If I get something really nice, I USPS it to myself.  On with the story:

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a pawn shop picking up some tools for a gig and checking out the game consoles and games.  Had a nice, relaxed time chatting with the manager and the guys on the counter. Picked up a bag of tools, wrenches, sockets, hammer, tape measures, etc. you get the idea.  For maybe $35 bucks I was pretty well equipped.  Happy with my purchases, I went out to my rental car.  This particular pawn shop shares a parking lot with a burger thing of some stripe.  As I'm walking to my car, a kid from the back of the pawn shop comes sprinting out of the roll up garage door on the side of the building and tries to tackle me.  A bit of background, I'm just under 6' tall and go about 250 lbs. Well into middle age but I'm a veteran with  hand-to-hand combat training and I live a pretty rough-and-tumble lifestyle.  I may be kinda fat and kinda old but I can handle myself.

Anyway, kid comes running out screaming ""Shoplifter!!!"" and tries to tackle me. I've got time to see him coming, so I plant my feet and get ready. At the last second, kid jumps and lands on me like he's looking for a piggy-back ride.  Kid is about as big around as my thigh. 5'7"" 120lbs tops. Maybe 19 or 20 years old.  I leaned with his jump and launched him over my head to land in an unceremonious pile in the parking lot.   I looked up to see the windows in the burger thing across the parking lot filled with people watching and shooting cell phone video.  I'd seen the security video in the pawn shop, so I knew they were watching also.  Kid jumps to his feet and grabs me like hes trying to pull my arms behind my back to handcuff me.  Only he doesn't have handcuffs, and I'm bigger than he is in all dimensions, so he's not moving me.  Pawn Shop manager and counter employees come running out the front door, yelling for kid to back off. Kid thinks he has backup and tries harder to take me down.  I tossed him into the wall.  Turned to manager and told him to call his boss and the legal department because they had a real problem.  Cops rolled in after having received several call from folks in the burger thing about the fight in the parking lot.  Kid started in again about shoplifter and assault and battery.   Cops were very professional, separated us, took our statements, talked to the folks in the burger thing, reviewed some cell phone video, reviewed the store security footage, and arrested the kid for assaulting me.  I told the cops that I was only in town for a few days, so they could do whatever they wanted with him.  I found out later that the kid had gotten to do some community service.  The manager laid an XBox 360 and a stack of games on me by way of apology.  I donated it to the crew room at the gig I was on.  I didn't trust TSA that it wouldn't get stolen outta my luggage.

I get off my bus and do a couple of errands before heading into the store. When it’s my turn to get some service, I step up to the counter and show my mail stating my order number.
All is going well until the guy tells me, that he can’t find my order in his system. At all. At this point I just think, “oh it’s probably just a bit slow about processing, no worries.”. The guy tries to find it manually, without the order, to help me, but his search comes up short.
He guides me out to one of the salesmen, who tries to find it, but he can’t find it either. He even tries to go to their site, where I had reserved it less than 3 hours prior, but it doesn’t seem to exist anymore. By now, I am just feeling sad, disappointed and a bit annoyed. I had been so excited to get this laptop, and then they don’t have any record of it. The salesmen are all stumped after seeing my order but not finding the laptop.

At the end, the salesman I was brought to first tries to show me a few other options, but none of them had a touchscreen, which I really wanted, and everything else was too expensive, so I just decided to leave.

On my way out, and writing this as I sit in the bus going home, I’m almost tearing up, just because I had gotten my hopes up and been so thoroughly disappointed. I know, that they can’t do much about it, but, god dang, it’s not fun to take the bus for more than an hour each way and not getting what you came there for.",1,"The laptop you ordered doesn’t exist, miss...",128

390,Chancerson,0,t3_aw36n5,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aw36n5/booking_sites_ugh/,"Hey All, first time poster, thought id share this little story as its more of a frustration with large companies complaints procedures, for the sake of anonymity we will call the company 'The Hotel Directory.'  


I work for a small tech firm and we rarely have the time of day to book days off work for work related events as a company. We've recently hit a patch of quietness that allowed us to attend a fantastic conference the other side of the UK, Yay!  


I personally book the tickets for the event and then proceed to look for accomodation online. I find a very nice offer for 'Hotel A' through the Hotel Directory which satisfies our requirements. I book online, all is looking good.  
My reservation is emailed through to me and its all correct so Im getting excited for the event! The other rooms are booked also and emailed through to my colleagues. I believe all is well!  


Fast forward a couple of days and my boss emails me. Her email unfortunately states entirely different days of stay and at this point we are comparing reservations thinking something must have gone wrong on the Hotel directory site when we booked. We double checked the booking procedure and made sure that I could not have accidentally booked the rooms for seperate dates. Thankfully the mistake was not mine to be made. A colleague also emails me showing his reservation not even having dates on it at all, this pretty much confirmed to me that something had gone wrong with the online booking. Not to worry I think, Ill call 'Hotel A' and the support side of the Hotel directory and they should be able to see something has gone wrong and sort it out for us with hopefully no issues. Boy was I wrong.  


I explain to 'Hotel A' the situation of the messed up dates and they confirm that the bookings had messed up when they had arrived at their end but because we had done the booking through the Hotel Directory we needed to speak with them to get the change sorted. Bit of a pain but ok not to worry. I do ask if the dates are available their end for the booking and they let me know they are so I imagine this wont be too painful.  


I call the Hotel Directory and explain whats happened and what Ive spoken to 'Hotel A' about. Spoke to a lovely lady who basically said leave it with us, we will get it changed. So Im happy again and go about my working week.  


Couple days later I receive a call from the Hotel Directory informing me that the change request wasnt possible and that I have two options - Keep the messed up bookings for someone else to use or Cancel the bookings. I explain that:  


1) How am I meant to use bookings that apparently dont have a date assigned to them to someone else

2) If the online system broke, why am I having to suffer the consequences of the matter?

3) Cancelling the bookings isnt really desired due to us requiring these rooms.  


I ask if its possible to just cancel the bookings and rebook with him directly on the phone so we can make sure its all correct, he informs me that we can but we wont receive a refund for the cancelled bookings. At this point I'm getting a little ticked off that we are having to fork out more money for their booking systems malfunction. The phone call is shortly ended after I begin to raise my voice where I end up cancelling the bookings because as I see it, they are pointless.

Once I had calmed down I called 'Hotel A' to get written proof that the date changes were possible and they kindly oblige.  


I return to the Hotel Directory with written confirmation showing that the change was indeed possible with the hotel - They retaliate saying ""It was non refundable due to the special online price we paid"". At this moment I feel we are discussing two different points. I re-iterate, the issue isnt a refund matter and is actually the fact that theyve informed me the change wasnt possible when 'Hotel A' have indeed provided me with proof that the change was possible (And they had even kindly written that it wouldnt have cost any fee either).  


The Hotel Directory keep reiterating that it is non refundable and there is nothing they can do as I cancelled the bookings.

Regardless I end the phone conversation with a request to speak to a complaints department or a different customer service representative.  They inform me they will transfer me to the complaints department, I am on hold for roughly 20 seconds where I hear someone pick up the end of the phone and then place it down, disconnecting the call.  


I have since attempted to call the complaints department directly myself several times receiving the same treatment.  


Needless to say - I wont be using them again and ended up booking with Hotel A directly (As they hadnt even received the money from the first cancelled booking).

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Go direct when booking. Its a hell of a lot easier.

I like checking local malls so made sure to check out the mall in the area, while there my fiance treated me to some cheesecake [you know what kind]. And we looked around.

One of the stores was the one mentioned in my title, let's call it Magical. So I go in with my fiance and hear two girls gasp, I look up and two workers rush up to my and compliment my hair. Then one leans in and say ""you're a mermaid aren't you?"" And the other asks about Atlantica and if I plan on going back and taking my fiance or if I'm going to stay on land.

393,sjihaat,0,t3_avwskm,10,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/avwskm/im_going_to_kia_every_car_in_their_sales_lot/,"3 weeks ago, one morning my wife smelled oil from our 2011 Kia Sorento.  We had our local Midas look it over.  They concluded that it was the head gasket.  Now, this was terrible news.  For us to replace it would cost around $2000 and depending on how long it had been like this, we were looking at a potentially ruined engine.  Now, the Kia dealership is nearby and better equipped to fix this issue, so we decided to limp the vehicle over there.

This was Friday.  At the end of the day, the mechanic calls me and leaves a message simply saying that he needs to talk to me.  I didn't get it in time.

That night my wife and I were talking about our options.  We haven't had the best luck with the Sorento, and so we decided that we will look at vehicles the next day.

Saturday, we again go to the dealership to check out some vehicles.  We've been a good customer, so I thought we would be taken care of.  Oh how completely wrong I was.  After we found one we liked, we needed an appraisal on the Sorento.  The salesman sat in front of us and called the mechanic, somberly responding to what hes hearing ""Oh no...""   ""I cant believe it...""  ""Its that bad"".  After he got off the phone, he offered us virtually nothing for the vehicle.  $3000.  The KBB tradein value is about 8-9k.   We almost went ahead but decided to back out.

Monday, I call the service shop, the mechanic told me it wasnt the head gasket, but the oil filter housing.  $1400 repair but no collateral engine damage.  So the, theater from Saturday was intended to cheat us out of our vehicle when we were none the wiser.

At the same time they were fixing the problem, they suggested that we replace our battery.  I agreed.

Tuesday afternoon, after paying 1400 and getting into my vehicle, the radio/reverse camera panel was frozen black but with the camera reverse guide lines.  I noticed it but had to get back to work, so I would check after work.  Sure enough, the screen was frozen in the same state.

Wednesday, I call the service shop that they did something to my radio.  They looked at it that afternoon.  I got a call from them saying that the radio is completely shot and needs to be replaced.  ""Brent"" told me that they will not take liability because it is unrelated to the work that they did.  But they can help me by selling me a new radio for $700.

Since then, I have called them no less than 6 times talking to 3 different managers.  I have brought the vehicle there to be ""looked at"" with the 4th time being today.  They've been diverting all responsibility.  Every time I talk to them, they have one other thing that we need to try.  They will keep doing this until I give up... except I wont give up.  

I have a rock solid case:  the radio worked when it entered the garage, and it was broken when it came out 3 hours later.  In their paperwork, they have a note saying ""radio shorted out"".

How in God's name can they not take responsibility?  Unless this is part of their business model... to break something unrelated and not take responsibility.  The general manager tried telling me that ""this would have happened to the radio whether it was with them or with me"" to which I told him that its statistically impossible for it to be a coincidence to happen when they were fucking around with my engine and especially the battery.

At any rate, they have the vehicle for the next couple days and I'm driving one of their vehicles.  Im tempted to take a hammer to their radio and say that it just happened by itself.",1,I'm going to Kia every car in their sales lot.,36

I went around an aisle and saw a female employee texting on her phone.  She looked up and saw me and said, ""You did NOT just see that.""

As an aside, I don't care if an employee is on her phone.  Doesn't matter to me at all.  But I guess some customers might have snitched on her.

I said in reply, ""I didn't see anything, I don't know what you're talking about.""

She smiled and said okay, then started walking away to continue her work.

But I said, ""Wait a minute, I have something here that doesn't have a price on it.""

She came back and looked at it and said, ""Since you did not see anything, you can have it for $2.99.""

And I said, ""Cool!""  It probably would have at least twice that, maybe with a blue tag or not.  I didn't know or care.

A little while later I saw her and said, ""Just to let you know, the only thing I saw was an employee doing her job.""

And she said, ""Thanks.""

She rang me up a little later, and when she finished, I said, ""I'm sure I'll see you again.""

So, there used to be this small organic grocery store in my hometown, and they sold a lot of really nice food and brands that you usually cant find at bigger chains. So, every now and then, I would get sent down there to pick up a couple things if the fanily was planning on making a nice dinner.

A couple years ago however, the place was about to go outta buisness. I went there for my very last trip to pick up some brownie mix, as my younger sister was wanting to make a batch for an sleepover she was having that night. I get down there, but I cant find the stuff. There's only one employee working on the floor at that time, teenager or maybe early twenties. I go up to ask this guy where I can find the stuff. He tells me: ""Its ovee in isle two."" with an annoyed sigh. Kinda rude, but whatever. I tell him thanks, and head in that direction, a little confused, as thats usually where the dry cereal is.

Low abd behold. Another two minutes of searching turns up nothing but malt-o-meal generics abd special K.

Asshole doesnt even look up from his phone to wave a hand in my face and say ""then check the next one."" I ask him if he actually knows where it is, more than a little annoyed at this point.

In this story I will convert local currency into USD for clarity. Bear in mind that a standard price for a delivery order in my city is about $12 for food for two people.

This Satudray my husband and I decided to order some sushi, and for that I suggested to try out a new recently opened delivery service (DS later in the text). They did a really good job of promoting themselves even before they opened, promisimg to ""make a revolution in food and delivery"" in our city. We jumped onto their website, picked the items we wanted, checked their delivery fee - it said ""delivery on orders over $8"". Okay, nice. Our order was about $16, husband used a code for discount, so it got to about $12. We placed an order, and no one called us back in 15 minutes, so we called them ourselves.

**DS**: Let's check... Oh, yeah, here's your order. Unfortunately, you live in a remote area, and we have a different minimum order price to qualify for delivery, and that's 14$. Since you've used a discount code, you no longer qualify for delivery, so you can add something to your orderor cancel it.

We chose to cancel it, however, I couldn't really let go of the situation. I checked the website again, and while I understand the idea of remote areas, the shop was only a 20-minute drive from us. Besides, nowhere on there website was anything other than ""delivery on orders over $8"".

The next day I messaged them on a local network.

**Me**: Hi, we placed an order yesterday and were told you have different rates for delivery in remote areas. I was just wondering, where can I find any information about remote areas on your website? Is there a map or anything?

**DS**: Yeah, there was a map but we took it down. You can still look up fees in our ""terms of delivery section""

I send them a screenshot of their own website.

**Me**: Could you please point out where exactly is this written?  I'm sorry if I'm being an idiot, but it's a bit upsetting.

**DS**: Well, you got your info on the phone in the long run didn't you? So what's the problem? 

I reiterated that I wanted to know delivery rates BEFORE I placed my order, and that should be on the website, however, they ignored it. I decided to let it go, but my husband was fuming so he wrote a rant post about this delivery service in a local group. Many people came forward stating that they had issues with this DS too, mainly because of the poor food quality and overly long delivery time. For example, someone mentioned that they waited for their pizza for three hours, anf when it finally arrived, it was already cold and nasty. The DS got very defensive, they basically told everyone unhappy that if they didn't like they food, they had poor taste ""because other people like it"", also if customers were unhappy with them, they could order food somewhere else. In some cases they asked people as to why these issues were not discussed in private, and one person replied that he complained to them on their website, but was ignored for weeks. What's funny is that one of the arguments the DS made was ""we're a budding company, cut us some slack"" until someone discovered it was organized by someone who already had a delivery service that had tanked just a year before.

All in all, it was a show. Those guys lost a lot of their own customers because of their dismissive and rude communication and warded off many potential customers. ",1,How to get defensive and ruin your reputation overnight,136

So it’s a new day and I come stumbling in with some sunglasses on to help with the death beams they call lights in the emergency room and get all the paperwork done before a doctor takes me in for a checkup. Anyways the nurse takes me to my « room » which is just a curtain and I wait say 10ish minutes for the doctor, so he comes in and I can already tell it’s not gonna be a fun time and does his thing and says nothing is wrong and sends me stumbling out getting mad at me for being not convinced at all.Not the best idea. The moment I’m out there I just walk into a wall but I’m still sent on my way and such, the next day though was even worse,but since I’m « fine » i need to go to practice and thankfully my coach pulls me off and is angry at me even being there and rants about how I should’ve been to a doctor and not at the practice.

My grandparents are American citizens but don’t speak enough English to get through an entire detailed doctor’s appointment. Ever since I was little, I would go to their doctor’s appointments and translate for them. I see my grandparents nearly everyday and I am VERY close with them. Also, this story took place when I was 16 so it’s been a while and I’m recounting it as I remember it. Oh, and I had my school uniform on, this will be important later.


My grandmother has fibromyalgia, and was seeing a new doctor that was closer to her so she wouldn’t have to make the 30+ car drive to another city to see her other doctor. Her other doctor spoke her native language so she didn’t need a translator. In order to get her “official” appointment she needed a consultation and then an appointment with the office’s psychiatrist. I went to her consultation appointment, but she needed an actual translator for her psychiatrist consultation since it was more serious.

I wasn’t with her when this appointment occurred but I do know that she had to fill out over 60+ pages of information they needed. She finished the paperwork in the lobby with the translator and turned it in to the front desk woman. We went to the doctor’s office again in order to have her “official” consultation so that she could be prescribed some treatment and medication. Instead of being called to speak with what would her new doctor, we instead were called to speak with the psychiatrist’s assistant.

We were sat down in his office where we will meet our cast. 

GR - grandma
M - my mom
PA - psychiatrist’s assistant
A2 - assistant 2 (I don’t know her official title or who she was)
FB - fucking bitch (spawn of Satan who I wish I could have beaten to death)
Me

All of this is recounted from how I remember it and isn’t word for word. I’m also shortening it a bit as this whole encounter took over 30 minutes.

PA - Hello, GR, we noticed that we don’t have your patient forms that we gave you last time. We can’t let you see your doctor right now until we get those documents filled out.

Me - Hi, I’m her granddaughter, I wasn’t here for her last appointment but she told me before that she filled that out last time she was here with the translator that was hired. Could you check to make sure you guys actually happen? I know the questions are of a personal nature and I wasn’t allowed to help because I’m not an adult yet and not an actual translator.

PA - Yeah I’m sorry sweetie, we don’t have them and she’s going to have to come back to have another appointment with the psychiatrist and fill out the paperwork in order to see her doctor.

I was really disappointed to hear this as I knew that my grandmother only had a three day supply of her old pain killers and that this was the last chance she had at getting her prescription filled out so she wouldn’t have to live with the pain. I GR this and she gets emotional and starts to tear up, and she asks if I can call my mom to see if she can sort this out between them. I called my mom and gave the phone to the PA. The phone goes back and forth between me, the PA, A2 and GR. It’s back and forth for about fifteen minutes until A2 sees that GR is now in tears at this point and goes back to get her a box of tissues.

I had the phone in my hand at this point and was talking to M on the phone when FB decides to pipe up.

FB: This is America, and in America we speak English.

I. Fucking, Lost. it. I tell M what FB just said that I have to hang up because I was going to have some words with her. I turn to my grandmother and tell her, while holding back my own tears, that we would be leaving soon and that I would deal with this and told her what FB had just said, now, FB was sitting at a desk in the corner of this room the whole time, I knew she worked there but didn’t know her actual role. She had just been listening to this whole the entire time and decided that she needed to put her two cents in. 

I turned to A2 and told her not to go near my grandmother and to get the box of tissues away from her that I didn’t want ANY of them speaking to GR at this point. I turned to FB who is looking away and got up. Now, I am typically very reserved and quiet, and was especially so at this time, but my grandmother had practically raised me and had picked me up from school and took me home every single day with my grandpa since I was four years old. 

Me: What the fuck did you just say to my grandma?

FB: *taken aback that I would speak to her like that* What did you say to me?

Me: I said, what the fuck did you just say to my grandma? How dare you speak to her like that? She’s an American citizen just like you and an elderly woman at that. I will fucking flight you if you ever talk to my grandma like that again.

FB: I will have you escorted out for speaking to me like that.

Me: I’ll have you fired for speaking so rudely to my grandma. What even is your problem? You hadn’t even gotten involved in the situation before, it’s NONE of your business and I don’t care, I will make you wish you were never born for that.

FB: I have a right to free speech, and this is America and she needs to speak a language that everyone understands.

Me: Just as you have the right to free speech, so do I; and just because you have that right doesn’t mean that you won’t face the consequences for saying what you want to.

Now I know this sounds very r/iamverybadass, but you have to understand that i would take a bullet for my grandma and I was also crying the entire time I said this. I had a hard time confronting people but would do anything for my little old lady.

FB: Fine, I’ll let your school know what happened today.

Me: Go  ahead, if you do, I’ll be contacting the ACLU to see that you never work a day in your life again.

FB: If you DONT leave we’ll be calling the cops.

Me: Do it, nearly all the cops here are minorities as well and would LOVE to hear what you had to say to an old lady and a poor high school girl.

At this point, I had had enough and I just wanted to get out of there and call my grandmother’s old doctor to have her refill her prescription and see her soon. I grabbed my grandma’s hand and walked her to the car and went back inside and demanded my grandmother’s information. I told them I wanted her patient details NOW and out of the hands of people who couldn’t respect old ladies and belittled people like that. Ended up having my grandmother’s old doctor asking for her papers being transferred back over and my grandma getting her medication.

Don’t know what happened to FB after that but I hope she got fired and learned from her mistakes.

TL;DR: Woman at a doctor’s office told my grandmother, “this is America and in America we speak English.” Told her to fuck off and went off on her.",1,Don’t you dare talk to my grandmother like that you bitch. TL;DR at the bottom,37

This was around 2:30, so it's between the rushes, where I would expect to have slower workers who may be being trained on, and they were indeed a bit slow.

The larger woman directly in front of me placed her order, and after a couple of minutes, started asking random workers to finish her order ""because I'm on lunch break and I don't have time to wait.""

Her order eventually gets finished after a couple of minutes, and mine right after. We both proceed to the register.

She has her phone out displaying her rewards to be scanned. She makes the worker scan just her soda, which gets her to a $10 credit to her next order. She then has the worker ring up her tacos to use the credit.

At this point, I'm thinking ""you're in a hurry?""

The tacos come up to $6.something, as they're $2 each today. She asks ""so I have a credit toward my next order?"" and aftet being told no, she says ""make me 2 more tacos then. Oh, and bring them to my table so I don't hold up this gentleman behind me.""

I’m going to provide a little background for people that may not be English like me.
So here films are rated U for universal, PG for parental guidance, 12, 15 or 18.

I went to a large supermarket in the town over from mine one day. It isn’t my preferred supermarket but if it’s more convenient or if I’m feeling super lazy I might end up there, but it’s rare. Few times a year maybe.
One of the benefits of this particular chain is they have large isles of toys, and dvds, and games and household goods unlike my preferred local store which is mostly just food. 
Anyway I end up walking past the dvd section I see a new Harry Hill film or compilation thing so I throw it in my basket.
When I go to pay the guy behind the counter asks me;
SA; Do you have kids?
Me; what? Kids? No? Why?
SA; If you don’t have children I can’t sell you this DVD. 
Me; what?! it’s not even age rated!
SA; Yeah, but see this is parental guidance. You need to be a parent to purchase it. 

I just looked at this guy dumbfounded for s minute. I got out my ID and said.

Me; Look, I’m almost thirty. I can buy alcohol, condoms, cigarettes, literally anything in this store today. But you think I’m not allowed this PG film?
SA; I’m sorry sir but without children...

It was going nowhere so I told him to call his manager over. 
The managers on his way and I start apologising to the other customers in the queue behind me, who all look disapprovingly at me for causing such a stir. Anyway he turns up and I swear he said the said damn thing.
He agreed with me that I could buy a Universal, 12, 15 or 18 rated film, Tobacco or alcohol but like the store assistant said PG was for parents only.

Man I was so pissed off, I paid for my shopping, took it to the car and called the supermarkets customer service line. 
They were in as much disbelief as I was and said they’d call the store to notify them that they were able to sell me the dvd regardless of how many children I had fathered. 
I went to the customer service desk and explained what happened and they should be getting a call... eventually word came down that it was all good and I finally purchased the DVD.

Wasn’t that great to be honest. 

Had more fun reliving how stupid some people can be in this world then I ever did watching the DVD. 

Edit;
Never imagined this would get the attention it did! So many Americans saw this I think it’s only fair to leave a link here for Harry Hill to explain

Yesterday, my mom thought powder was stuck in my black eyebrows, but it was the light brunette colored pomade. I decided that I should exchange this pomade for a darker colored pomade. They do accept opened makeup products by the way as long as 80% of the product is still in there. I grabbed an unopened version of the product so I can give them the barcode. When they scanned it and asked for my phone number for my membership, it would not let them do a return, because my account shows to them that it is returned already. How weird!!

Now I want to set up a new server and need a new license/a new version. Turns out that the software ""A"" has been replaced by software ""B"". Judging by the description, the software still does *exactly* what I need (i.e. ""X"") at its core. There are two license types: ""Education"" and ""Corporate"". Neither applies to my situation. So I write an email to the company, asking for clarification:

&gt;*\[...\] have been using ""A"" for many years in our home network for ""X"" \[...\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I now want to move to ""B"" because the old \[...\] server will be replaced soon.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We're two users with \[N\] devices in the Windows network of a ""tech enthusiast"" household. Which pricing does apply?*

The reply:

&gt;*Thanks for using the product over the years.  We don't have a ""home tier"" per se currently as many home users now have* \[...\].  *We have found our market to be businesses.  That being said we might have something in the future.*

Ok. So there's no license for ""B"" that is in the same price range as the original software ""A"". But the price for the corporate license of ""B"" is still OK ($100). Of course, I understand that some companies do not sell to private customers. If this is the case, I'd like to know.

So I write:

&gt;*Is it A) that you don't offer the product to home users for a ""home user"" (i.e. lower) price?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In this case, I would be perfectly fine with ordering a corporate license \[...\].*

408,Branical,0,t3_auqqgh,66,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/auqqgh/cashier_tells_me_to_send_in_the_coupon_myself_and/,"My local Wally World feels like it's not necessary to train their cashiers, especially when it comes to coupons. I'm not one of those extreme couponers, I have maybe 1 or 2 of the same coupon but usually not more than 5-10 coupons total. Here's just a few of the run ins between me and the cashiers:

1. I had a Buy One Get One Free (up to $3.99) coupon for some juice (cost $3.49) and the cashier could not understand why the computer was only taking off $3.49 instead of $3.99 when she scanned the coupon. She was afraid her register would be $0.50 short and she told me the juice HAS to be $3.99 or else I can't use the coupon. I tried explaining that she just writes in $3.49 in the box where it says, but she didn't understand.
2. Some, but not all, coupons say ""Limit of 4 like coupons per household."" One cashier took that as I can only use 4 coupons total. I had the corporate coupon policy already on my phone just in case, so I showed him where it says ""There is no limit on the number of coupons (variety) that can be used in a total transaction"" and he just says ""Our store is different.""
3. Coupons say ""Limit one coupon per purchase"" which means you can only use 1 coupon on each item and you can't double up coupons on the same item. I was buying 2 boxes of cereal and had 2 $1.00 off coupons. Cashier tried to tell me I can only use 1 of those coupons.
4. One cashier thought my coupon was expired already even though it expired 12/31/18 (this was May of 2018).
5. I had won a free 12 pack of Coke and they mailed me a coupon. The cashier said they don't take coupons for free stuff, even though the corporate policy says they don't accept free coupons that are *printed at home*.
6. The most mind-blowing experience was when the cashier told me I have to mail the coupon in myself. In the fine print at the bottom under ""Retailer"" it gives a redeem address so the retailer knows where to send the coupon. This poor old woman was nice about it, but she insisted that I was the one who had to mail it. I tried telling her that it says that for the Retailer, this coupon is only $0.50 off and that wouldn't even cover the cost of a stamp, and how would the manufacturer know I bought the item? Luckily another cashier overheard us and told her to scan the coupon and put it under her till.

I've tried calling the corporate number about the lack of training and they give me the ""We'll handle it"" line but nothing ever changes. There's a handful of cashiers who are actually knowledgeable about coupons and I'll stand in a longer line just to get one of them, but they don't seem to last very long at this store.",1,Cashier tells me to send in the coupon myself and other coupon woes,299
409,Yatagarasu513,0,t3_auk2ny,20,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/auk2ny/yep_we_totally_sell_game_models_in_this_small/,"So, back when I lived in the UK, I played some miniature based tabletop and board games. When this incident occured, I'd just visited a specialist chain to pick up a model in blister packaging, and since the UK has a law charging for plastic bags, I figured it wasn't worth breaking a second note for one. Therefore, I put the figure in the front pocket of my hoodie, where it created a noticeable bulge.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, I visited a small branch of a popular supermarket. Bear in mind, this supermarket only sells to-go food, basic sundries, and a small selection of toiletries. I'm just popping in to get some milk, so I quickly pay, and head out the doors. As I do, a member of store security (S) stops me.

&amp;#x200B;

S: ""Excuse me Sir, have you paid for all your items?""

Me: ""Yes, I have."" (Holding up the receipt in my free hand)

S: ""And the item in your pocket?""

Me: ""Oh! Sorry, it's not from here.""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I take the blister out, and show him. He asks to see it properly - I assume he either wants to check it to make sure I'm not using it to conceal an item, or that he recognises it. I hand it to him, and he looks carefully at it. Then it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

S: ""This is from our store. Please come with me.""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm completely confused. The figure is clearly visible, and looks nothing like anything in the store. It also has the name of the company I'd bought it from on the packaging. The security guard finds who I assume to be a manager working in the store, and talks to him quietly. The manager takes a good look at the model, and then takes it and walks over to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manager: ""Hey, sorry about that. This obviously isn't from here. You can go.""

&amp;#x200B;

The security guard looked a bit unhappy, but I guess he trusted his boss' take on it. I get to leave with a rather funny store about a guard that thought his store sold gaming figurines. Not the most outrageous story, just something I've always found kinda silly!

So real quick, my friends and I are wrestlers and we're still in season. I have women's states coming up in a few week and I'm super pumped and my one friend, for simplicity i'll call him L, got third in districts and this Friday, he's leaving school early to go wrestle in regions to possibly get to states. We had plans to go grab some snacks to sneak into the movies that night and L needed new headphones since to pump himself up before matches, he has to have his music. Wrestling is relevant cause our coaches instilled a respect for others in us and we also know their punishment if we were to get out of hand would make us feel like we are dying.

So casting. My friends are L and T, Me is Me, Mama Bear is my mom, TG is tech guy, CSG is the woman who handled us at customer service, and Security and Manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

We just went to eat at a fast food place before heading over to Hellmart since L wanted new headphones and his old pair broke. Previously he had used my earbuds before his matches and though it didn't bother me, he wasn't taking my earbuds away from me for a whole weekend. I'd go crazy. I split off to go grab candy for the movies as L and T said they'd be going towards the toy section since we're just a bunch of kids. Highschoolers, but dumb kids. I passed electronics and they were looking at headphones, so I go over to them. L is looking at headphones and he really wants this pair of rockcandy wireless headphones but was short by ten bucks. I told him if he gave me the money he had, I'd pay for them and he'd just give me the ten he owned me another day. He said bet and so we made our way to the cash register. Being the only one in the group that managed to balance school, Wrestling, and a job, I had money and I swiped my card. 

We walk not two feet out of the store and I had L the box. Excited for his new headphones, he opens the box and it isn't looking right. Right off the bat, it isn't factory sealed. It looked like it was before we opened it, but that was a different story when we opened the box. Last time I checked, all my headphones and earbuds i buy from rockcandy weren't sealed with hot glue and it was messy. You could see where the strands of hot glue came off the main clumps and in the box, was a cloth bag. there was the rockcandy logo and so we go to take the headphones out. the box said they were black but the color we saw was some rose gold and chipped. There's even hot glue residue on the cloth bag. We pull out the headphones and they were busted. the left side was falling off, held by the wire, attempted to be hot glued together. We turned, walked back into the store, and L walked straight to TG who sold us these headphones. He apologized and took us right up to customer service. 

TG: So these guys just bought these and now they want to return them.

CSG: But these aren't what's on the box. 

TG: I know and I handed it to them sealed so I don't know what they're trying to pull. 

CSG then turns to L and asks him how old he is. He responds back seventeen and she scoffs and rolls her eyes and proceeds to try and tell us what the policy is, explaining that they can't do a return or exchange for minors, (then why would you sell to them if you can't make returns or exchanges?) the serial numbers didn't match up, any excuse she could come up with. Originally, we would have been fine with an exchange. In fact, that's what we asked for, but their excuses kept piling up so I took it into my hands to get someone who could handle the situation.

If there is one thing i learned from my own experience in retail, a mom is one of the worse things to have to deal with since they won't stop till they get their way. Back when TVShack was still a thing, Mama Bear worked there and would tell stories of people returning vcrs and dvd players with brick in the box. She knows this game well.  I call her. I had been texting her this whole time to keep her updated on our forty-five minute dealing with customer service. I explain that they are doing nothing, Mama Bear says she""s on her way. 

Upon arrival, Mama Bear informs me that she called corporate and the head of customer service to complain and both had said that they cannot refuse us without legit proof we were trying to pull a fast one on them. We don't even have a bag to hide headphones in if we could pull a fast one and we have hoodies and we walked about fifteen minutes to get to hellmart. We could not have pulled a fast one since we turned right back around upon opening, and the headphones would be seen if hidden by the hoodie. Mama Bear gets to the front of the line at customer service and here's the start. She is greeted with a manager to handle this situation. 

Mama Bear: Hi. I'm going to let you know right now that I am fully aware of the situation and I have spoken to corporate. I know my kids would not have tried to pull a fast one as they had barely left the store and if they did pull a fast one, I'd bash their heads in and tell you to have a nice day. SO, these are a pair of $50 rockcandy headphones that they have been scammed out of and at this point we would like a return. As you can see on this receipt they had bought this an hour ago and has dealt with you for over fifty minutes at this point. You had claimed that the serial numbers do not match up but you can see from the receipt and the bar code, they do match up, there is hot glue on the box so it is clear it is not factory sealed and and I have my daughters text log and my call log from corporate and the sales associates manager. So what would you like to do about this?

The entire time, CSG is saying that management already said no, we cant refund minors, no no no no. I got to the point I wanted to slap her. I had to hold back cause if I did something stupid and got in serious trouble, even though Mama Bear was handling the situation, she'd slap the taste out of my mouth, curb stomp me, and then told my wrestling coaches, who would most likely have me run sprints till my legs gave out and have me run some more. 

Manager: Well they are broken and they aren't even rockcandy so-

Mama bear: Why else do you think we have a problem with this and want the return?

The manager said to give us a moment and went to check security tapes. Security came out and manager has a smug smile on her face. 

Security: We looked at the tapes and they received it sealed. 

Mama Bear: Okay but you see this? Its hot glue. If they bought this at 1:37 like the receipt says, and I started getting messages at 1:42, how could they have done this and the hot glue dry that quickly? 

Mama Bear is getting louder and louder as the workers kept giving excuses as to why they couldn't go through with the refund, but Mama Bear had shut them up with her argument. Security checked with the Manager again and I guess they finally said to just give us the refund so my mom and us would go away. I got my money back and we left, got in the car, and Mama Bear drove out. Mama Bear turned back to us.

Mama Bear: Now i hope you three know, I believe that you wouldn't do that and that you were sold a rip-off, but if you ever tried to do that shit for real, i'd have you all wishing you spent the night in jail than what I would do to yous. 

We went to my house to have some dinner before heading out to the movies and my dad ended up ordering L a pair of headphones that weren't rockcandy, but by a trusted company when L gave him the money that originally he had given to me. Should be in by mid week and we kept thanking Mama Bear while she dropped us off at the movie theater and when she picked us back up and dropped us off at our respective houses. She says the worse part about this was having to put on a bra. I'm grateful for Mama Bear and I know full well, i'd get the belt if I ever did something stupid like that. Hopefully I won't have to use her against retail workers again and I can use what I learned from this experience to handle the situation myself come the time I should.",1,We just bought these and barely left the store when we opened them.

This past fall, my nephew asked me if I would buy him something for his birthday. Seeing that I did have the money, he told me he wanted this pricey Copic drawing set. My sister ended up taking me, along with my nephew, to this art supply store, the first time I had ever been in this store. Now, the Copic set had a price of almost $40, but, I didn't mind. Then, after spending a few minutes looking for the art supplies in this store, I discovered that this store has these Copic drawing kits locked up in a cabinet.

Not thinking anything about it, I went to the front of the store, looking for an employee. When I finally found someone (and mind you, I'm mobility impaired), this employee, a guy, tells me ""I can't help you"" and just wanders off. No explanation, no offer to find someone else to help me and I'm standing there confused about what just had happened.

There I am, looking confounded, I caught the attention of another employee who asked if I needed help. The employee unlocked the cabinet and ended up asking another employee for assistance. When I headed up to the counter, another employee ( I think she was a supervisor or manager) and she said she would ring me up. I started telling her what happened when I asked the first employee for help (he was standing at a cash register when I asked him for help and he refused) she ended up apologizing to me and gave me a $10 off discount for the trouble. She explained to me that their registers had been down all day and that he was in a hurry to get out of the store.

The lady who rang me up at the register told me that I should file a complaint online so they were aware of it. That made me smile. I thought, *what a nice idea*.

Few days later, after I calmed down, I emailed the store through their website and was told that they would hold a meeting in dealing with customers the right way and that they would also talk to the employee involved. While I didn't want this employee to get fired (which I kept saying throughout this whole process) the lady who emailed me also sent me a couple of coupons good for her store.

I even praised the help of the other employees who were kind in assisting me and in marking the price on that Copic set down by $10. If the guy who I asked for help from had explained things such as the registers being down and that he was trying to finish up so he could go home, I would have said ""that's okay"" and simply looked for another employee.

In the end, my nephew got what he wanted (he's a pretty good artist, such as nature drawings and even comic-book good), I was able to get this store's management to address treating their customers with respect and ended up talking to their district manager, ending with a cordial experience.

Okay, cool! They’re gonna take care of it. Fast forward a few days and the technician comes home. We tell him the issue, he looked at the device and basically told us that these things are obsolete. (We’re from Puerto Rico, so we don’t have the same advanced ones that TVP has over the USA). He told us TVP is waiting for *[name of certain phone carrier that bought TVP]* to install 5G networks to implement the new systems, so basically we’re stuck with that old junk. However, to see if it fixes anything, he factory reset the whole thing, erasing every bit of movie and TV show we had recorded, gave us a new remote, and left. 

Nevertheless, this didn’t resolve the issue at all. We were left with a recently erased device that still works as awful as ever. But hey, I don’t blame the technician, it’s an issue that’s way out of his hands. The problem was when the bill monthly bill came from TVP. They were charging us **≈$184.50 USD**, ≈$54.50 more than the correct amount. Now, we’re a family in a pretty tight economic situation and this took us by surprise, so when we called TVP to ask what the extra $54.50 was about. They told us it’s the bill for the tech support.

Now hold on a second. First of all, they **never** said we had to pay an extra amount of money for them to fix **their** faulty machinery. And secondly, the issue was never fixed, the problems were never gone so, what the hell??

We explained this to them, but they still insist on us having to pay those extra $54.50 for... basically nothing. We’re waiting for a reply to see if they’ll get rid of the charges. Whatever happens I’ll keep you guys updated. 

**TL;DR:** TV provider wants to charge us almost $55 USD for a technician visit that didn’t fix anything at all from their faulty device.",1,Sure! Let’s just throw away $55 for nothing!,202
413,CapraMori,0,t3_aumijv,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aumijv/intimidating_clerks/,"Last night (about 7pm on a Sunday) I went to my local big-name grocery store to pick up some meals for the next week. I had a full basket, a 12 pack of soda, and a 6 pack of beer (relevant to the story). I'd usually go to the self check out but this was the first time I've purchased alcohol at the grocery store and knowing they'd have to see my ID figured self check out would make it more complicated (not to mention self checkout was full of people as usual and the clerk had enough to deal with). The place wasn't too busy so when I approached the check out counters, there was one clerk and bagger working with one customer, no one waiting behind them, and one counter with it's light on but the clerk was leaning up against the counter with her back to it, chit-chatting with her bagger. I figure the lights on so it'd be stupid to ask if their lane was open but damn you'd think I had personally offended them by getting groceries.

I set my basket on the little ledge next to the conveyor belt like you're supposed to and the clerk grabs it while I'm making sure it's on the counter and won't fall. Because she's trying to wrestle the basket into place while I'm still trying to set it down properly, I make a comment about how the ledge is smaller than the basket and let out a nervous laugh, as this woman is making it difficult for me to get my arm out from under the handles. She completely ignores me and once I'm free and step over to the opposite side of the counter, I realize the bagger had been speaking. I wasn't sure if it was to me but by the time I was within earshot of her all I heard was ""are boxes okay?"" I know some stores recycle boxes that their shipments come in and send customers out with boxes instead of bags, but didn't know of this chain to ever use boxes so I say to her ""uh, bags are fine.""

Meanwhile, the cashier is literally shouting ""WHAT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. I NEED TO KNOW YOUR BIRTHDAY."" at me because of the alcohol I'm buying. At the same time she's shouting this at me the bagger responds with ""yeah, bags are fine."" I ignore this comment for now to apologize to the cashier because she was still shouting at me for my birthday. I say sorry a couple of times, handing her my I.D. then I turn back to the bagger and ask her what she had asked me. She says ""oh, I didn't ask you anything. You answered a question I wasn't going to ask you."" In a very short, matter-of-fact tone. I laugh it off and apologize for the confusion. The bagger at that point steps around to the cashier's side and stops bagging to tell the cashier about the first time she had been pulled over because the cops had been watching her at a park and thought she was doing drugs and then pulled her over because they thought she was driving while drunk.

Last I checked those are the kinds of conversations you don't have at work on the clock in front of customers. But whatever, it's 2019, she looked young enough for it to have been a first job or side job while she's in school, and it was just a grocery store so I ignored it. Another employee comes up to the end of the counter to bag my groceries and I'm staring at the screen wishing and waiting for this awkward encounter to end, fully expecting the new bagger to completely ignore me. New bagger makes a point to look at me and say ""Hello!"" To me cheerfully and loud enough that I know he's talking to me but not yelling at me like the cashier. I say hello and smile at him and he smiles back, says ""hi"" again, and proceeds to bag my groceries. I pay the cashier who realized then that she was holding my I.D. still, as if it were hers and says so handing it back to me.

Like I mentioned, I had a basket full of groceries, no cart. They saw me walk up with the basket on my arm, the beer in the hand that the basket was on, and the soda pack in my free hand. The cashier asks, side-eyeing me ""you don't need a cart?"" I tell her ""oh, no thank you, I've got it."" And start to put my arm through the handles of the bags. She then shoves all of my groceries across the counter, squishing them up in front of me (luckily all of the products were in secure packaging and my bread was undamaged). I load up as quickly as possible despite there being no one behind me waiting, and as I start to walk away say ""Thanks, guys. Have a good night"" to all of the employees, as they are now all standing around talking loudly except for the one who actually said hello to me and who actually did their job bagging. He's the only one who gave me a response, saying ""thanks, you too!"" I thought maybe I had been there past closing, warranting the unfriendly and unprofessional treatment but it was still before 8pm, none of the calls over the P.A. while I was there were to report the store closing, and as I was walking out, customers were still walking in.

Not a particularly exciting or interesting story by any means, it was just the most abrasive experience I've ever had checking out at a grocery store.",1,Intimidating clerks,92
414,SnowyOxygen,0,t3_auui10,0,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/auui10/when_ordering_computer_parts_takes_an_entire_month/,"Some context here: I'm a 20 year old musician who spends A LOT of time playing video games on my computer. The geek in me showed itself at around 11, when I moved to the countryside in another country. Before I hit 18, I had been mostly using my mum's computer and an old computer my sister gave me for gaming. Come 18, I decided to get my own.

So I do my research, I speak with friends, and browse sites. Eventually I found this site where you could build a pc using their pc builder which would check the compatibility of the parts, and then send you the parts for you to build yourself. In the end I settled on parts which came up to roughly 1000 dollars / euros / pounds. The PC was fairly powerful and still is. As I just turned 18, I paid for the PC myself.

Now this is where the fun begins. As I had just placed a fairly large order on parts, I eagerly watched the delivery site update me on their location (It was being delivered to a drop off point in -insert town here-).
First hiccup: They tell me it will arrive Saturday. So, come Saturday I go to into town (without checking the site again of course) and the guy in the drop off store tells me there is no package under that name. I check the site again: packages will be delivered Monday. Ok...
This time I checked the site before leaving. ""Packages will be delivered Tuesday"". I started getting worried, but decided to give it another chance before doing anything.

Here comes the big oof. I check it again, this time everything seems fine, until I get to the shop. I tell the shop owner / manager my name, and he retrieves my boxes. I could tell something was wrong from the start. Big box for a 27 inch screen? Yup. Big box for a big tower case? Yup. A very small laptop bag for what was essentially EVERYTHING that went into my PC case, the keyboard, mouse, and 5.1 speaker system? Uh no. I gave the small box a funny look when he put it in front of me and the shop owner (who had nothing to do with this) immediately asked me if I wanted to open the package to check what was inside. Someone had recieved 800 dollars / euros / pounds worth of parts instead of my notebook, and vice versa.

""Would you like me to sign it as 'unsatisfactory' and send it back?"" the shop manager told me. I immediately said yes, having shown him (with my receipt) that this tiny laptop was obviously not what I ordered. This apparently was a mistake on my part, as I hadn't read the site's return policy, but we'll get to that later. When I got home, I immediately called the site and explained the situation.
The man on the phone then informed me that I would have to wait for the unwanted product (the laptop) to return ALL THE WAY to their factory BEFORE sending me the parts that I had already paid over 1000 for DESPITE the laptop having officially been sent out in the same state and packaging it arrived in. Does anyone else find this abnormal? I started getting angry, but considering there wasn't anything else I could do and the guy was just the customer support, I let it slide and decided to wait. Usually where I live, shipping takes at most 4 days from one spot to another in the same country. So after 2 weeks of radio silence from the site and watching the returning laptop literally sitting in the same town, I call them again.

I explain to them the situation again (as it's a different person picking up), and ask what on earth is going on. The lady on the phone asks me: ""did you print out and stick our return label on the front of your package?"". I'm confused for a few seconds, and then think to myself ""oh no..."".
The lady then explains their company return policy which is: when returning a product, print the label provided on their site and stick it to various places on the product and packaging. I start getting a cold sweat as I thought that I might have just lost 1000 worth of parts just for a damn label. The lady does however just tell me to wait.
Now two seconds guys: does this company return policy seem weird to you? Because I assumed (so did the shop manager and my parents) that returning the package immediately would garantee that it was sent back in perfect order. It hadn't even left the shop before i returned it.
Anyway, the lady explained to me that I just had to wait a bit longer for the package to find its way back. Fine.
I waited 3 days, and called again because I was starting to get angry, but I was told the same thing. I called one last time 2 days later, and was told that my package was in fact moving to the factory.
Another 2 days passed and hallelujah, the site informed me 3 weeks after I had ordered them, my parts were being shipped. They took another week to arrive, and the computer I built from them worked (and still does) just fine.
Sure, waiting a month for something to arrive isn't really that big of a deal. But having around 1k worth in parts floating around somewhere in your country not knowing whether you'll actually get them was pretty annoying.

So that's it gu- BUT WAIT! There's one last thing.

The keyboard didn't work.
After all that, they sent me a faulty keyboard.

I recently went to a brand new glasses retailer, let's call it's GlassesStore. It's a major chain, you can find them everywhere. I haven't gotten new glasses in like 5 years, but my prescription is basically exactly the same. I went in, picked out my frames, and of course they tried to sell me on all kind of things like UV protection, smudge resistance, ultra thin lenses, etc, but I told them I just wanted the regular, no extra cost lenses. 

Then I get my glasses, and oh my God. These lenses are THICK!! They're literally twice the size of the frame, and the frustrating part is I can't even wear them because the sharp edge of the lenses cuts into my upper cheek. I had literally never seen lenses this big. I showed them to my mom, and she said she hasn't had glasses like that since the 80s. 

I called them to complain (politely) and to ask to return them, and the guy on the phone told me that the thickness was to be expected for my prescription, and that I could come in and pay more money for their thinner lenses. I don't normally get mad at businesses, but right now I am pissed because that man lied to my face. These freaking lenses are twice as big as my previous glasses with the same prescription, that's a load of crap. 

What I think might be happening, is that they give you these big ass, uncomfortable lenses so that you want to buy their thinner, more expensive lenses. When I get home today, I'll get my tape measure and update on how thick these things actually are. IDK if I'm overreacting, or if this really is just ridiculous. Rant over, lol.

Now I don’t know what goes into creating an online marketplace, but when I made my request for help I assumed this is a pretty easy fix. At this point I’m just angry it’s taking so long to talk to someone, but I guess I’m stuck waiting unless I want to respond and receive “a delay in handling your request.” The good news is I don’t really intend on using their marketplace again so hopefully I just get my game soon and never deal with them again.",1,15 Days and Counting for Customer Service,8

My boyfriend and I had decided to go out for dinner at our local Boston pizza which has been great to us every other time we've been there. We have not been back to this location since, but the manager has told me this waitress doesn't work there anymore. 

So we get there, were seated at a table in the middle of the room, there's lots of room on either side of us (remember this for later), and the restaurants pretty dead (also important for later), so we didn't have to wait very long for service. Everything starts off fine, the waitress takes our order, brings us the drinks and then food a little while later. She's friendly, a little more so to my boyfriend, but that's fine, we aren't the jealous type. 

He had the jambalaya and underestimated the spice level so he was going through ice teas like crazy and sweat was dripping down his face. I think I had the ravioli so my drink was emptying at a normal rate because I know I can't handle spicy foods. 

Well this waitress would refill his glass when it became low, but neglect mine (remember it wasn't busy), I didn't get a refill the whole dinner. Everytime she needed to pass by she did an unnecessary squeeze by and brushed her cup size B boobs along his back and arms like mine aren't 2 cup sizes bigger than hers (remember all that room I said we had?), and she only brought out one wet nap after we had finished our food. 

The best part though is when she brought out the check. She had written her number on it for my boyfriend to take. I just looked at him and said ""oh look, she left you her number."" 

Now I'm not a jealous person but we were very clearly out for date night, and the lack of service for me was unacceptable to start, but with the phone number on the check I was livid. I was paying. Her face when I pulled out my debit card was great. She got no tip, when we stood up my boyfriend grabbed my hand, and I handed the check to the store manager after paying for the food and let him know I was out for a nice dinner with my boyfriend. Her face then was one of pure defeat. 

He took one look at the check and offered us two free appetizers, which I declined because I like the manager. He was an oddball but he was always super nice to me when he came through my till and thats always a plus for me. A little while later he told me he fired her not long after because she had previous complaints of the same thing. 

I mean, who uses a restaurant where people go out for dates as a hunting ground? How often does that really work? Was tinder not getting any results? ",1,"All the service for my boyfriend, none for me.",2425

We rescued our dog from a shelter when she was about 6 months old. They fixed her and gave her the first round of vaccines before we were able to take her home, and told us to bring her back in 2 weeks so she could receive the last booster shot she needed. When we picked her up after her being fixed, everyone at the vet was super nice and friendly so of course we brought her back to the same vet instead of finding a new one. Our second visit was not at all like the first. 


The way they had it set up, there was a door for leaving, and a door for entering. As we were trying to enter, there was a lady with a small dog blocking the entryway while talking to the receptionist. Our dog was still super young at the time, and was very excited to be on a trip out and seeing other dogs so between trying to control her and get in the door, and then this lady blocking the doorway I was struggling to get inside. The receptionist looks at me, sees the lady she’s talking to in my way, and then tells me I need to hurry up and get out of the way. At first I thought she was talking to the lady actually in the way, but no she was talking to me and then repeated herself again when I still didn’t move. Finally the lady got out of my way, and we got inside. 


We sit down because she’s still talking to this lady. After a few minutes when the lady finally leaves, she looks at us and rudely asks what we’re here for. I tell her we’re here for our dog’s final round of shots. She says okay I’ll be with you in a minute. 


After a couple minutes she calls me up to the desk to get our information. She looks up our dog in the system, and this is the conversation that follows:


Receptionist: “Oh. Your dog is not fully vaccinated yet.”

Me: “No, that’s why...”

*Cuts me off while I’m talking.*

R: “She needs to be fully vaccinated before you take her anywhere and let her fully interact with any other dogs.”

Me: “I know. That’s why we’re here.”

R: “It’s really not safe for you to be taking her places yet.”

Me: “That’s why we’re here. When we picked her up two weeks ago we were told to bring her back for her final round of shots. We have not taken her anywhere other than here because we know she needs to be fully vaccinated.”

R: “Oh. Okay, good.”


She then finishes getting us checked in, but is rude and short throughout the entire process. I was about ready to never bring our dog back there again but then the tech that called us back to actually give her the shot was super friendly and sweet and made up for the whole previous interaction.

420,MostlyPretentious,0,t3_auhqce,2,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/auhqce/literal_garbage_fire/,"(TLDR is at the bottom.)

One day a handful of years back my wife and I were killing time while visiting family in Los Angeles. We’d just walked along Venice beach and were wandering back when we stopped into a shop. It was a small, independent shop that sold fashion accessories, purses, makeup, jewelry. It was a little pricey for the area and a little too far from the main flow of traffic, so it didn’t look like they had many customers. People would stop in, but walk out after less than a minute.

Now, my wife and I are okay spending a little more for a nice product at a small business. As such, my wife is trying to give things a fair look and is hoping to find something, so we’re wandering around a good 20 minutes and the cashier has been really helpful. Eventually my wife finds some things in our price range and we go to check out.

It should be noted that this was a time before the ubiquity of smartphones. It was also before all those simple digital payment options people have now, and this shop was so small it didn’t even have a computerized point-of-sale system —  as such, the checkout process was not fast.

As we’re getting checked out, I notice what looks like smoke coming from the garbage bin on the sidewalk outside. I assume it’s a trick of the eye — maybe just dust? — and we carry on. A few seconds pass and now I smell it. When I look up, it’s no longer mistakable — the garbage bin is on fire. The flames grow fast and are soon shooting up at least three feet in the air *above the top of the garbage bin* which is about three feet high on it’s own.

Boy Scout though I may have been, my brain was unprepared to believe what I was seeing, so I just gawk while my wife and the cashier are handling payment, unaware of the fire outside. Fortunately, someone else bursts in and yells “the garbage is on fire!”

You’d think that would be a call to action for the cashier since the garbage bin is a few feet from the open door to this shop. But, no. The salesperson/cashier wanted to see this sale through. So she ignores the woman yelling “fire!” and keeps running my wife’s credit card.

The woman is confused and says, more insistently and louder, “Did you hear me? Call the Fire Department!”

The cashier continues running the credit card.

The flames have now grown, and thick, acrid smoke is pouring out of the garbage bin. My wife and I tell the cashier to set our stuff aside and to make the call.

Instead the cashier gets out a bag and starts bagging the items.

We all share confused looks as we watch this happen. I get out my cell phone and start to dial, but the cashier waves it away and finally picks up her phone and dials.

Then she *sets the phone down* (leaving the emergency operator waiting?) to finish wrapping and bagging  our stuff.

As we take our stuff, the woman starts yelling at the cashier again calling her irresponsible and yelling about safety. But, as the cashier starts to pick up the phone again to finish the call, someone shows up from down the street and douses the fire with an extinguisher.

So, seeing that the fire is out, the cashier decided “problem solved” and hangs up, turns to us with a smile and says: “Have a nice day!”

TLDR: Desperate to make a sale, a salesperson ignores the literal garbage bin fire to finish ringing us up while LA burns.

We haven’t been there in months because the last few times it’s been closed.

The restaurant we were having dinner at was right across from the ice-cream place, so we decided to swing past and double check what time they close. We were told pretty clearly that they close at 10pm, which is what the website also said.

Happy, we went off for dinner and planned to head over for ice cream around 9pm. We enjoy our meal and as we’re thinking about getting the bill we look over and and notice they appear to be packing up. It’s only 8:45, so as my partner gets the bill I decide to duck over and see if I can still order our ice-cream. Nope, the displays are empty! Staff are still in the front of the shop and I’m still able to approach the counter, so I just say “excuse, what time do you close please?” And was told 10pm again. I pointed out that it wasn’t even 9 yet and expressed I was disappointed because we’d made a point of checking their closing time.

A rather rude employee steps forward and says “we close early when it’s raining”. Which would be fine, except that it wasn’t raining, hadn’t been raining and there was no rain forecast. When I mention this (confused but not rude), the rude employee raises her voice and says ultra slowly “because you seem to be too stupid to understand, we’re closed!”

Wow! Until this point I just wanted to understand how things rolled so that I could avoid yet another disappointment in the future, but this really ticked me off.

Fast forward months later for my next donation. I wait to be seen by a nurse. The ‘Did someone die?’ nurse appears and looks at me as I give her my utmost NOPE look and she gets the message and takes another donor. I wait for a normal nurse. The end.

My partner called and asked if our dietary wishes could be applied to their recipes ans they reassured us that they could.

I've been a member of this company ""Thread Solution"" for about a year now, and I've always been satisfied. The clothes can get pricey ($150+) but as a plus sized woman who has cried in store fitting rooms finding nothing that fits, this service has been a lifesaver. I actually feel good about myself and have many stylish clothes.

That wasn't what made me cry, though. This company has a policy of paying three days after getting the box of items. They also have the option to extend the payment day through their app, if one needs X amount of more time. 

On October 28th 2018, my dog Niko (10 years 10 months) was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and had to be hospitalized. After his hospitalization, there were a lot of bills to pay (my boyfriend and I didn't have pet insurance). Since my dog's illness was very unpredictable, money would have to be spent suddenly. I had to ask for long extensions many times, apologizing but stating that my dog was sick and money was tight. I recieved many kind messages from customer service allowing me the extension and wishing for him to get better, and it was extremely thoughtful of them.

On December 11th 2018, just one week after his 11th birthday (I believe he hung in there for us), my good boye became extremely sick (fell into diabetic ketoacidosis again so we rushed him to the hospital and the vet said there wasn't anything we could do) and my boyfriend and I had to make the painful decision to have our little brother cross the rainbow bridge. Pet cremation fees are a fortune ($800) so I postponed my clothing subscription for January, explaining that my dog had passed away and there were bills so I couldn't afford that month's box, but that I was so thankful for their well wishes through this tough time.

A few weeks ago, I get a small package from the company, which surprised me as I had postponed my box for the month.

I open the package, and there is a handwritten card from someone from the company expressing their condolences regarding my dog's passing. They also sent a candle which has a paw print on it and has written ""No Longer by My Side but Forever in My Heart."" 

I broke down ugly crying and when I told my boyfriend when he came home from work, he began crying as well. If you've lost a beloved pet, you know how awful the pain is. The fact that this company did such a nice gesture during such a trying time was incredibly touching.

I wrote to them and thanked them for such a kind gift especially since I'd had to keep postpoing payments and had to cancel one month's shipment. They replied:

Hi Queenofstarts, 

Thanks for reaching out - I'm so glad we were able to brighten your day I understand how difficult this time must be for you. We're always here if you need anything. 

My boyfriend and I will light that candle the 11th of every month to remember our dog's beautiful spirit and soul. He's irreplaceable. So, so, so good and so kind. There will NEVER be another Niko.

Thank you ""Thread Solution"" for such an unexpected but wonderful gesture.

RIP our sweet and wonderful Little Brother/Boba Pett/Best Friend Niko ❤️ 12.02.07-12.11.18 ❤️ You are too good to suffer from that horrible illness.

Edit - Here is a picture of the candle and the memory corner we have dedicated to him - https://imgur.com/a/dSeU5ZA

Edit 2 - Crying again due to all the wonderful comments on here. I will be replying to everyone shortly! 

Edit 3 - Clarity 

Edit 4 - More detail, and GOLD?! I'm so touched by the Reddit community's overwhelming support ❤️

Me: “just this, please”

Cashier: “you guys together?”

Me: “no, we’re paying separately”

Cashier looks at my friend and says “what, you can’t even buy her a drink? Jesus” then looks back at me and says “it’s on me, Happy Late Valentine’s Day”

About 12 hours ago, I attempted to go through the drive-thru of the first Furger King store to open up in my area 50 years ago.

I pulled into the lot to see a green truck sitting in the middle of the parking lot, to the point that nobody could get around them. There was a car that turned in before me, but with no turn signal, that was between me &amp; this soon to be discovered idiot in the green truck.

He pulls into the drive-thru line, up to the speaker, &amp; I believe he begins to order. He's there for 5 whole minutes at the speaker before the next car pulls up. The white car is done quickly &amp; I pull up next to notice a sign on the menu:

I've already ranted about his stupidity to my girlfriend &amp; I hurriedly parked to hop out &amp; beat this waste of existence into line since he already owed me 5 minutes for his illiteracy/stupidity, IMO. I'm so quick my girlfriend thought I was going to start something.

I wait for 5 minutes before an order is even handed out, &amp; it's a replacement order. About that time, I noticed a guy is behind the counter doing absolutely nothing. I also noticed that the food is coming out at the speed of a geriatric attempting to swim through molasses (personal experience of being a slower worker at this chain myself, yet I KNOW I could have done better than the kitchen staff working there).

I'm hyper aware of time now, &amp; 3 more minutes, another order was called. 5 more minutes another, but these guys weren't paying attention.

My family (me, f42, husband, m40, first child, m just 4, baby, m almost 1) just returned from a holiday in Gran Canaria. 

The hotel was a big one, a little dated but with a sort of faded glamour. It was kept very clean and the staff were lovely.

We paid for all inclusive so we wore wristbands during our stay. I'm not sure if all guests wore them in different colours if they were half board or bed and breakfast, or if some guests didn't wear them. This is relevant and I wish I had paid attention now.

Our last day we had to check out at noon, although our transfer to the airport bus didn't come until 1.15pm. We checked out, they cut off out wristbands, we went for a little walk then returned and sat at the front of the hotel. The hotel was at the end of a road with nothing else on it so there were no passers by just guests.

My son is 4, and I am 42, so it was necessary for us both to pee before getting on a 45min bus ride. I walked back into the hotel with my baby in a sling on my front and toddler beside me. We went down a stair to a disabled loo (bathroom) we had used a couple of times as it had a baby change table and had more space than a cubicle for all of us.

I peed quickly, and was redoing my jeans while telling my son to get on and pee, when the door handle shook. It was locked so I said nothing. Then there was a loud knock, so I called 'occupied'. My son was trying to pee but, distracted, asked why I was shouting. I tried to explain to him but there was more loud aggressive knocking so I shouted 'occupied!'. I was quite stressed. I'm anxiety-prone and packing and getting ready on time with two small children isn't relaxing. My son was looking at me, worried, and said he couldn't pee so I helped him with his trousers and to wash his hands, while the knocking happened again and again. I could only think it was a very desperate or cross disabled person, so I really hurried, we were probably in there for 2 minutes in total if that.

I opened the door with our hands still wet, and saw a cleaning lady with a big cart looking really fierce, wanting to come in and clean. I was so upset. I hate confrontation but I was quite shocked. Forgetting she wouldn't understand me, I choked out, 'We didn't take long! My son couldn't pee and now he might wet himself on the coach!'. I couldn't say anything more as I was tearful, so just hurried away.

It seems silly now to get so upset (and I must remember not to say embarrassing things like that now my son is getting older). But I am still annoyed and confused. All the other staff members were so nice. Did she think we didn't belong in that loo? But I had a baby on me! I would  have changed him if she hadn't been banging on the door. Did she think we shouldn't be in the hotel as we didn't have a wristband? That's the only thing I can think of. But it wasn't a hotel you were likely to be just passing by. I haven't complained to the hotel because technically I was no longer a guest there, though by less than an hour after a 10 night stay.

It was a nasty end to a nice stay.

430,Kaymurphs,0,t3_atqrro,22,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/atqrro/hospital_heaven/,"So my first post on reddit was called hospital hell in this sub. I was in a bad car accident and was treated awfully in the ER afterwards. Flash forward to last Saturday, I was at my apartment with my bf and two friends when something started to feel weird. 

Let me preface this with my recent med change. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember and after a little vacation to rehab and throughout recovery I decided to no longer take my benzos even though that’s not what my drug of choice was. I went to months of therapy and learned coping skills and haven’t really had a panic attack in the two years I’ve been clean. I was also on celexa the whole time and recently felt like it wasn’t working as strongly. So I went to a new doctor and he doesn’t prescribe benzos at all but he agreed to switch my antidepressants to Prozac. 

Well let me tell you that was a big fucking mistake. It all hit me Saturday night and I started to feel woozy and like I was going to have a seizure. This made me panic even more and for some reason I basically forgot I even had anxiety and was freaking out about what could have caused this. At first I was trying to be discrete as to not alarm my friends and make them uncomfortable but then I couldn’t keep it to myself as I was getting progressively more scared. 

I tried throwing up in an attempt to get whatever it was out of me and then chugged water to maybe flush it out. But it was getting worse and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I’m causing a scene and everyone’s telling me to just chill out bc I’m fine. They didn’t understand what was going on either. So for a solid hour I tried to get rid of this impending doom until I truly thought I was going to die. I’m only 27 and death is not on my to do list any time soon so I begged to be taken to the hospital. My friend immediately accepted and drove me down. Unfortunately I had to go to the same hospital as before bc it was the closet and I couldn’t get there fast enough.

I walked in being held up my friend sobbing and told them what I finally realized was a panic attack. They got me into intake quick and I was mildly upset with how long they were taking even though I know it’s protocol. It really felt like having to watch an ad on YouTube before a first aid video. And the intake lady acted like I was fine and asked me all her questions until I finally got to go to a room. 

The nurse, Whitney, came in and immediately was sympathetic and comforting. She told me I was not going to die and she was going to take care of me. Before she even gave me the lorazepam I started to calm down from her presence alone. I haven’t had a good experience at the hospital before and often times get doctors or other people that don’t believe how severe the panic is plus I was scared they would know I’m in recovery and think I was just drug seeking. But she didn’t judge me or even think twice she only helped and helped quickly. I know now that I was not going to die that night but I truly thought I was and I’m so grateful for that nurse for what I thought was saving my life. In all my 27 years I’ve never been that scared and she was there for me. I called the hospital tonight to let a supervisor know how amazing she is and I hope she gets the credit she is due. 

Thanks again Whitney, you don’t know how much you mean to people you only know for an hour, but it’s a lot. ",1,Hospital heaven,444

To preface, I have worked in various customer service positions my entire adult life. Sometimes I can be a bit gruff on the phone, but I'm well aware that the person I'm speaking with rarely has it out for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I opened a new phone plan for myself and my mother and things have been okay. Or so we thought, it turns out that we're only getting about 40% of any calls or voicemails. We did some basic troubleshooting and when it didn't solve the problem, I decided to call support after I had missed a phone interview due to the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I call, wait like a good girl for someone to get on the line. I describe the problem and her only response ""Sounds like a network issue.""

So I ring them and ask what’s going on, leads to me making a complaint.

Here’s where they mess up first. The guy on the phone says the complaints team will call me between 4-6 on a certain day, I agree and take the afternoon off work that day to make sure I don’t miss the call. They want a lot of money from me and because I live on my own I’m a little freaked out. Basically I want this sorted ASAP.

Where I work we aren’t allowed our phones on us while working due to the nature of our job (working with sensitive data, public facing etc). So when I leave early at 3 I’m surprised to turn my phone on and have a voicemail from Paul the complaints guy giving me my scheduled call at 2pm.

I get home and ring the department back and ask his colleague if he can call me back later today. She says no and that he will try calling me again tomorrow between 8-11 due to his workload. She didn’t even pause and ask anyone, just straight up tells me no. I’m a bit flabbergasted but explain I’ve taken the afternoon off to take this call as I work 9-5 and then she finally puts me on hold to go arrange something with Paul. She comes back after five minutes of hold music to say he will try and call me today but if he doesn’t he will call tomorrow. 

I can’t be bothered with this woman anymore so just agree and end the call. She didn’t care at all about me or my situation and it showed so I just waited for Paul to call.

He finally does and we talk through the situation and the bill. He explains that it is fully valid and that I owe the full sum on the bill. I try to explain rationally my side of the story and how the bill is incorrect and he just carries on maintaining that the bill is correct. I try getting a bit annoyed and ranting about how it isn’t correct and again, like an robot he just spouts the same jargon about rates etc.

I was at the end of my tether. There was only one more thing I could think of to do...

I cried.

I’m not proud of doing it but I did. And it’s lucky I did because as soon as my voice broke, those fake tears rolled down my cheeks and the sniffles started, Paul changed his tune.

He then couldn’t have been more helpful.  He seemed to actually listen to what I was saying, how this amount couldn’t be correct and how anyone would struggle to pay this in one go. He told me he would personally look over the account and keep me updated every step of the way. He also agreed to only call me back during times that suited me with my work, his workload be damned!

I thanked him and ended the call. Heard from him the next day and got the result I wanted. He halved the bill by backdating to the tariff I had originally agreed on with the company. Even gave me some compensation.

Onto to the (LONG) story:

Last Thursday just happened to be Valentine's Day and my partner (20M) and I (20F) decided to go out for dinner. We decided on a Spanish resturant we had been to before and really enjoyed; so we booked the night and thought nothing more of it. 

I would like to set the scene, if you would indulge me. The resturant screamed Valentine's Day; heart shaped balloons at every window, so much heart confetti on both the floor and the tables, and every table had a candle. It screamed romance, if you were basing it off a cheesy rom-com moment. The most important detail was that there was a live singer, singing spanish songs and who would dance around the resturant (remember this for later). We took it in good stride however, and brushed it off as a fun turn on the evening. 

Now, our waiter was a casual man, I would estimate in his 30s. Throughout the evening, he made a number of ""jokes"" at the expense of my partner. A key point to make here is that this is not uncommon. My partner has played rugby since a young age and has the build to show for it. Because of this, it's common for him to have jokes made about him to emasculate him, as it is the reverese of his image; which he will take in good stride most of the time. The difference to usual though was that the jokes were being made at me about him; the waiter was kind of ignoring he was there. Still, we brush it off as the usual jokes some people make.

We then noticed that he was very complimentary of anything I ordered. The food I picked was a ""good choice"" and the drinks were a ""perfect decision"". Again, this was only to my orders, with my partner being ignored. At this point, my partner was suspicious and a little annoyed. I'll be honest, I had had one too many cocktails, was enjoying my date, and brushed it off as him trying to get tips. 

However, the final puzzle piece was by the end of the night, when both my partner and I were enjoying our last drink before we got the bill. Remember the singing man? Well, he had a spare microphone, which he gave to our waiter. So, they were singing together, wandering round the resturant; which had about 15 tables in total with couples. The waiter would sit down at the tables, sing to the couples, and was good entertainment. This was fine...until he got to our table last. I am sitting this, in a conversation with my partner, when someone reaches round me and grabs my hand. The waiter pulls me up and starts to dance the salsa with me; with my partner at the table wondering what the h*ll is going on. 

Now, I have had this done before at public events and sprinkle some social anxiety on top, I go along with it. There are some people clapping along with the music; so I dance a bit, hoping it will be over so I don't have to make a scene and ruin other people's fun. I finally pull myself away and sit back at my table, keeping my head down so I don't freak out. We finish our drinks and leave very quickly; with me feeling anxious and my partner feeling jealous and angry. 

So, yeah, the Valentine's Day date, with all the signs of the holiday you can get, and he decides that this was all acceptable. We won't be going back to that resturant and, next year, we agreed to order Chinese and watch Lord of the Rings or something.

My boyfriend speaks 7 languages (some better than others of course but still impressive if you ask me) and we went to Brussels for a short trip. He had to do all the talking since he can speak Dutch and French and  I successfully repressed all the French I had learned in school.

And you know Belgian waffles right, they're awesoome. So we went to one of those ""vans"" that sell waffles on the street and here it goes. (wg: waffle guy, bf: my boyfriend)

Bf(in French) : two waffles pleass

Wg(didn't hear it properly; in English) : two?

Bf(in dutch) : yeah, two

Wg after handing us the waffles, apparently overheard us talking german (in German) : goodbye

Both of us(in German) : thank you, bye

This story happened yesterday.

My mother (**M**) had some spare time and I, being the somewhat useful person I am, decided to help her with her errands. My little brother needed to print a photo of a movie they've watched in some class, so we decided to make a quick stop at the local photographer. We roll up to the parking lot and as she turns the engine off, she tells me it's pointless for me to get out with her, so I just wait for her in the car, doing my thing. After what seemed like an eternity (which was really about 10 minutes), she comes out, her face completely confused, she sits in the car and hands me the printed picture to put in her bag. And this is when the conversation starts:  


**ME**: Hey, are you ok? Why do you have that look?  
**M**: I'm confused, last time we printed something, it cost us 1€ less.  
**ME**: Maybe they just changed prices, oh and, did he forget to give you the usb back?  
**M**: No no, it's in my wallet. He told me he did some photoshop? He didn't explain what he did, so I have no idea what that meant.

Now, some background, I studied graphic design, so I know my way around Photoshop like a wine mom knows her way around the alcohol section at Aldi's. So I told her:  


**ME**: Photoshop? What does that mean? It's a screenshot from a movie, what did he photoshop?  


And so I take a peek at the photo and struggle to keep my composure as the loudest laugh comes out of my mouth. The movie was ""Au revoir les enfants"", which in Italy, is translated to what in English would be ""Goodbye kids"".  The photographer thought the photo was made with my mom's phone and the kids were just some relatives she was saying goodbye to. So the smart guy, without asking, opened the image on Photoshop, changed the values around and brightened up the image, gave it a bit more saturation and adjusted the contrast, thinking he was being **so so** generous to this lady. All the while ranting about how his studio is the only shop where you can get quality prints and that the competition in the area is not even worth looking at and all that jazz.

This is what happens when you become so full of yourself, you drive your own clients away and force yourself on their choices. Saddest thing is, he named a couple of other shops who do the same things he does, so thank you, Mr. Photographer, for informing us of every other place in the area, that we will definitely go to, instead of coming to you.",1,"Photographer does ""some photoshop"" on a screenshot from a movie.",122
440,fuckfacemcgee21,0,t3_at9wsu,114,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/at9wsu/i_guess_horse_girls_are_only_rude_if_your/,"This happened a few years ago and i still think about it and laugh to myself. Back in high school me and my boyfriend were off of school one day and decided to take a trip to a really nice horseback riding equipment store in Delaware (we live about 30 minutes outside of Delaware in PA). I had recently just started back up in riding and am in no way wealthy enough to even have my own horse. I worked on a farm at the time in exchange for free riding. I needed basic things like boots, gloves, and riding pants. 

I’ve never been to a real riding store before and was super excited but knew what to expect: snotty, judgey, rude horse girls who would take one look at me and laugh. I didn’t dress nice, do my makeup or anything so I was ready for hellfire from these employees. We get there and I’m honestly a little nervous, the store was in a rich area and had mostly expensive things. As we go in there’s these two blonde girls on the floor and to my surprise smile and are really friendly. I was chatting it up with the one girl and she explained it was the other girls first day on the job and she was training her. My boyfriend kinda hung back because this was not his Mojo but he was super supportive of my passions so he tried to show as much interest as he could. 

Now, I’m not in any way the kind of woman who thinks every time we go out to eat the waitress is flirting with my boyfriend, or any time a girl talks to him she’s hitting on him. We’re both mature and have never even ran into a situation like that.....until then. 

I grab most of the things I need and am really happy with how helpful these girls have been. Not judgey and really understanding of my budget. I finally get to the pants section and have to try them on so I’m in the dressing room for 20 minutes or so. When I went in the dressing room the new girl was standing there with my boyfriend just making conversation and the girl training her had gone to the front to help another employee at the register. When I came out the new girls friendly demeanor had diminished and she was straight faced and barely spoke a word to me. I assumed it was because her trainer had gone and she could be her bitchy self, but I didn’t pay any mind to it. 

We get to the front, checkout, and leave; new girl didn’t even offer a smile or goodbye even as I was thanking them and what not. Me and my boyfriend get in the car and he starts cracking up. I was so confused and asked him wtf he’s going on about. This is what he told me went down while I was in the dressing room...

(Bf- my boyfriend)

(NG- New girl)

NG: Do you ride at all or did you just tag along?

Bf: oh no way I would die if I got on a horse! That’s  her thing, I’m just here for support.

NG: I mean I could teach you if you want I think you’d like it. 

Bf: haha no thank you she’s tired 100 times and I haven’t budged.

NG: I can understand that, So like are you guys brother and sister orrrr

Bf: No that’s my girlfriend. 

NG: Oh. That’s nice I guess.

He then tried to tell her how I’ve been riding my whole life yadayada to kind of clear the air of the awkwardness that just transpired. But she literally just ignored him and nodded her head the whole time. A few minutes after is when I came out of the fitting room and noticed her entire demeanor was different. 

We laughed in the car for like ten minutes as I poked fun at him because he looked so messy and still got hit on (sweatpants, crazy hair and beard). We still joke about it from time to time and have never had an experience like that since then. 

Tdlr: friendly employee hits on my boyfriend thinking he was my brother and turns into rude b*tch after  learning I am in fact his girlfriend. 


[edit] wow this actually blew up and I do want to clarify based on a few comments that I am not saying all “horse girls” (or English riders in general) are snotty and catty. Based off of my own personal experiences I have found that it can be an incredibly cliquey sport. But everyone has different experiences! I’m sorry if anyone was offended in the comments, I think a lot of things got taken out of context. All in all love what you do, don’t be a dick, and it’s awesome getting to talk to all of you who share this passion!",1,I guess horse girls are only rude if your boyfriend is unavailable,1290

#I am not telling this story from a racially biased point of view, I am not going to stretch the truth at all to make this story more comical, and I do not wish to stereotype anyone beyond what they present. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, this story is not a bad or a sad one. It's a funny one. A bit of backstory: I used to have an old shitty laptop. In 2015, a game came out that I wanted to play, but my laptop couldn't run it. So, I made the stellar decision to buy a gaming laptop, because I was 12 and stupid. So, I bought a laptop from GENERIC BULK BUYING STORE for $1000. Right before they started putting desktop graphics cards in laptops. I still have this laptop, by some miracle it's able to run most games with it's GTX 950M and i7 6700HQ (mobile graphics card and cpu). It's only failed me twice, which leads me to my story.

&amp;nbsp;

So, the hard drive has failed twice, normally bad, but since I got it from GENERIC BULK STORE, I've had warranty covered both times. On the first time, I had to call tech support, and lo and behold who answers but some Indian guy. I'm not biased at all, but good lord this guy was a walking stereotype. His accent was thicker than molasses, and if you need a reference, imagine Apu from the simpsons.

I'm reading off error codes for him, and of course because I am 13 and oper8r as fuck, I'm using the phonetic alphabet. So let's say the error code was this: DTEB123. It was a lot longer but that's as much as I can remember without embellishing. This was the exchange:

&amp;nbsp;

Me: Alright so the error code reads D as in Delta, T as in Tango, E as in Echo, B as in Bravo, 1 2 3.

Him: OK sir I am going to read that back to you: D as in *Divine*, T as in *Tranquility*, E as in *Enlightenment*, and B as in *Beauty*.

443,Marble_Dinosaur,0,t3_at9o31,28,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/at9o31/fastfood_nightmare/,"Last night I was babysitting my niece and nephew so my sister could have some time to herself. Being the amazing Aunty I am, I took them to the shops to get fast food for dinner.

Now my nephew wanted a footlong sub so we waited in line, ordered, paid ect. All was well. Until my niece and I decided to get dinner from a place that rhymes with...Nick Fonald's.

Now, I also work at this franchise, but at a different location. So I know all the do's and don'ts of this place, and I know how stressful it can be!

I wait in line and order and I get served by a lovely girl who we will call Lisa. Lisa was being really sweet to my niece and opening her toy for her ect. I was like ""dang she's great maybe I should say something to the manager?"" However I am so socially awkward, I couldn't bring myself to!

So, I finally get my food from a manager who says the drinks shouldn't be long. I smile and say okay! Although I notice everyone else gets their drinks immediately with their meals.

I wait for like 5 minutes, in which orders 10+ after mine are getting their drinks. I look at the drinks screen to see my order isn't on there anymore, which I know means that they probably thought someone else did it. 

So I just ask the worker and she makes my drinks for me. I go and sit down with my (quite patient) niece and nephew and we start eating. I look in the bag to find an extra large chips. Score!

But I look in my nieces box and find she was given fries instead of yogurt. So I scoop them up because I'd look like a scammer with an empty packet, right? I then go back up and politely say to Lisa that I ordered yoghurt instead of fries. She's very apologetic and says she will fix it.

But then to my absolute HORROR she TIPS the fries I just gave her back into the fry station with all the other cooked fries. My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe she'd do that - I had those fries for probably 15 minutes and could have licked them or worse. She came back and handed me my yogurt and I walked away, stunned.

The place was insanely busy, and I KNOW I should have said something at the time but I was literally so incredibly shocked I just went back to my table.

But oh, this isn't over yet. I sit down to eat to find that my double cheeseburger is a normal cheeseburger. At this point I'm quite annoyed, but I look over and see my niece is unknowingly eating my burger. As it was in her child's meal, she didn't realise it wasn't her burger and just ate it.

When I say this out loud she gets really teary and apologises, saying she should have looked at it before she ate it. But I quickly comfort her saying it wasn't her fault. But seriously, who puts a double cheeseburger in a kids meal?

All in all it was one of the most shocking and horrifying experiences, and I'll probably never go back there. However, I'm going to call in today to make a complaint about Lisa putting the fries back. 

Safe to say it's turned me off fries because i don't know who could have been eating them first!

444,HomoHirsutus,0,t3_at1u8a,34,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/at1u8a/moving_truck_rental_company_didnt_have_enough/,"So this happened to me a few years ago. It was June 30th and I was moving out of my apartment and into a different one a few miles away. I had made a reservation 3 weeks in advance to have a small to medium moving truck from who we will call RMC (Random Moving Company). So on the morning of my move I called the rental company to confirm my reservation. This is my story. Characters are: ME= Myself, SM=Store Manager(♀), CC=Counter Clerk(♀), IR=Irate Customers. 

I call at about 8am and I immediately here, CC: Thank you for calling RMC please hold, click. I was disconnected. That fine, it happens, I have accidentally tried to put someone of hold and accidentally ended the call. So I call right back. 

CC: Thank you calling RMC, please hold. Beep. So now I am on hold, which again is fine, so I wait and wait and wait. 20 minutes later I am still on hold. No one has come back on and said anything like thank you for waiting we will be with you shortly. Its just silence with a beep every few seconds.  So I decide to hang up, wait a few minutes and call back. Maybe they will be less busy. Well, they are not. I end up calling back, being put on hold for no less than 20 minutes per episode before I hang up and try again. I do this 5 times. By now my friends who are going to help me move have all showed up, but we have no truck. So my beautiful friends start loading up smaller things into their cars and begin making little trips. But thats not going to work for the furniture. I have a 1+ bedroom that was 750 square foot and I had a decent amount of stuff. 

So after my 5th call, and being placed on hold never to hear from anyone again, I was pissed. So I got into my car and drove to the RMC and I walk in to complete and utter chaos. There are at least 20 other people waiting in line and they all look pissed. And that is when I hear the root of the problem as the store manager explains it to a customer. 

SM: Im sorry sir, but we do not have enough trucks to fill our reservations. You are going to have to wait until another customer returns a truck. 

IC#1: I made my reservation 2 months ago why didnt you order enough trucks to make sure we all had a truck waiting? 

SM: This is a very busy month, a lot of people move on July 1st. 

IC#1: So why didnt you call stores in other cities or states and have trucks delivered to meet your orders?

SM: (I love the answer) Because we have to pay the other stores to use their trucks. 

At this point Im thinking to myself, well isnt that the point? You arent making any money today because people are walking out. So while this is going on, I notice the the phone is ringing.... constantly. And I hear that familiar voice of the CC saying, Thank you for calling RMC, please hold, over and over. But not once to I see the CC going back to the phone to deal with any of the phone customers. And that is pretty much when my gasket flips. 

ME: Excuse me, I say to the CC, are you going to actually talk to any of those customers on the phone or just keep putting them on hold and ignoring them? Because the only reason I am standing here in your lobby is because you put me on hold 5 times and never got back to me and now I am here and I am pissed. Those people on the phone are customers too. As I say this several of the other IC in the store agree verbally. 

CC: Well I am just to busy to deal with them. 

IC#2: That is your job sweetie. 

ME: Well if you had at least explained to me on the phone what was going on I wouldnt be here, but now you are going to have to deal with me. But those other people on the phone deserve to know they arent getting trucks today and the sooner they know that, the sooner they can scramble to try to make other plans. We all have to be out of our apartments by midnight or we could face having to pay a penalty, and guess who is paying that penalty if I get hit with one? 

At this point the other customers think I am a God. Yes, yes I know. Autographs were signed, pictures were taken, babies were kissed. (OK not really). In reality, there was nothing I could do but wait and so I did. Finally a few trucks and vans came back in and I was up to get mine. Of course I told the SM that there was no way in hell I was paying full price for my truck, and she actually only charged me $50 for it, and said she would comp that if I could get the truck back in an hour. I told her 90 minutes and she agreed. I made it in time, so I was comped and she offered me a %50 coupon on my next rental, but I politely declined saying that I would not be back.

So my wife and I took our 4 year old son to a theme park for the week of Valentines day. It was also our 10 year anniversary.  
I spoke to the Concierge and together we formulated a devious plan to have some nice things done on Valentines day. He gave me the number for a local florist, advised me that their restaurant makes excellent Macarons (my wife loves Macarons), found a space at the hotel Teppanyaki restaurant for 8pm, and booked my son in to the Kids Club from 5:30pm until 9:30pm, enough time for all the things Valentines/Anniversary requires including dinner.

So in short the following was arranged:

* Flowers from the florist to arrive after lunchtime while we were out of the room
* Macarons to arrive after lunchtime while we were out of the room
* Kids club 5:30pm til 9:30pm
* Dinner 8pm

Goal: Wife suitably impressed, many happy times, good food, exhausted child

Valentines Day arrives, we get out of bed and go down to the restaurant for breakfast. Eat breakfast.

Return to room to find that flowers had been delivered while we were at breakfast. Ok, not a huge deal, busiest day of the year for the florists, they were probably just sending it hard to get everything delivered. Early suprise, happy valentines day/anniversary!

We head out and spend half a day at a theme park, and the second half at a water park. Honestly it was an amazing day and our son had the greatest time. Everything was great.

Return to the room around 5pm, have to get our son checked in to Kids Club at 5:30pm.

No Macarons.

At this stage I explain to my wife that there's a missing surprise that I need to chase up from the Hotel.

So I call reception and ask about it, they have no record of this request. I explain that I spoke to the Concierge who in turn put me on to a lady in the restaurant whose name was Naomi. Reception calls restaurant, it's just after 5pm at this stage so everything is hectic in the restaurant. She comes back and apologises to me, and explains that they have nothing recorded about it, but the Food &amp; Beverage Manager Aaron is fixing it and sending Macarons up. All good, problem resolved.

We take our son to Kids Club and when we return there is a lady waiting outside our room with a wooden platter with 4 Macarons and a complimentary bottle of wine (about half size). That's a nice bonus. Neither my wife and I are wine drinkers but I made an exception.

Wife eats the Macarons, and says ""This wooden platter is kind of nice but it looks like it's a floorboard haha"".

Then she goes ""Oh my god. It IS a floor board. I've found the exact same pattern on our floor. And look, on the back it has the groove for clipping it together!""

Sure enough, the hotel restaurant delivered our Macarons on a small piece of click (floating) floor board! We have photos to show it next to the matching piece in our floor, and the underside showing the groove (but can't link to Imgur in this sr)

We laughed about it, I was fairly conflicted as I think I probably *should* be upset about it, but it was just funny. I'm sure it was clean and hygienic and maybe it's something they just do because floor boards are a good width for use as a small platter?

Anyway, the rest of the night was amazing, food was great, son had a great time at kids club and was super exhausted so a good nights sleep for all. The holiday was amazing overall and all is well. Just a fun story!

Back before &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; went out of business, I had decided to stop at &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; one day to check out what new manga or Blu-ray deals I could find at the local &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; location. Before I stopped into &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt;, I had purchased some items from another store, which found me walking into &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; with my paid-for purchases. While walking through the store (keep in mind that I was wearing my winter coat and my hair was somewhat long (shoulder-length) and this old bitty woman, an employee, had been following me around the store.

Soon, I realized what she was doing and after five minutes of this, I finally decided I had had enough of this woman. I spun around, to where I was face to face with this employee and asked ""is there a problem?"" I didn't say this kindly or with respect, I was being antagonistic when I said it. She then tells me that &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; doesn't allow customers to walk into their store with bags from other stores. This raised my aggression level to atmospheric levels and I told her that ""&lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; doesn't have anything worth stealing"" and that if she didn't stop following me, I would make a loud scene and file complaints with her store manager and also file a complaint with &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; corporate.

Suffice it to say that what I did scared her and she ran off and disappeared behind a locked door at the back of the store. Thing is, I had around $300 in my pocket and I was looking for particular DVD boxed sets. I didn't end up buying anything because one of their employees had pissed me off over how I was treated. I ended up filing a complaint through the &lt;\*\*\*\*&gt; website and they acknowledged my complaint.

Employees of stores generally hope that a customer doesn't confront them but when they are confronted, they tend to slink away and cower in a corner somewhere.

There was also a second altercation where I had walked into the same location and that security alarm that blares if you try to exit the store with an unpaid item. Well, it goes off as I'm trying to enter the store. (How can you steal something before you enter their store)? SO, one of their cashiers saunters over and asks if I have anything in my pockets. Of course, I don't, except for my wallet. I pulled my wallet out of my pocket and I said ""just this"". This idiotic, moronic employee makes a move to grab my wallet. I had forgotten that I had purchased a DVD and had stored the security tag inside my wallet. This security tag was from a DVD I had legally purchased at another store, I just forgot that I had it in my wallet.

Yeah, you guessed it, I jerked my hand away from the employee and said ""what the fuck do you think you're doing? people get a trip to the hospital or planted in the ground for pulling shit like that"".

449,egb233,0,t3_asu25m,43,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/asu25m/buy_at_full_price_return_for_sale_price/,"Year or so ago I went to a big chain department store that usually on the pricier side. My out-of-town family always sends me gift cards for this store, otherwise I wouldn’t shop there much. 

After receiving two $25 cards, I decided I would treat myself to a few outfits. So I go and pick out some shirts and a pair of pants but didn’t try them on because who has time for that. 

I go to check out, use my gift cards and pay what the cards didn’t cover. Mind you, all the clothes I got were full price. No sale, no discount. 

When I got home I tried everything on. One of the shirts was a little snug and didn’t really look good on me. No big deal, I can return it since I still have the receipt. A week/2weeks later, I get the time to return it. I also checked the return policy: return within 30 days and with tags and receipt. I was in the clear. 

So I go to customer service and provide everything needed to return this shirt. The employee scanned everything and said ‘if that’s all for you, I can refund $X on a gift card or with cash.’ 

I told her gift card would be fine but asked to hear the return amount. 

‘You’ll get back $X’

I told her that was half the price I paid for it and it even says on the receipt that I paid $XX for it. 

‘Sorry ma’am, the shirt you are returning is now on clearance. The barcode in the system has been changed to $X so I have to give you that amount.’

So I’m not really one for confrontation but I definitely questioned this logic. I told her when I bought it, proved how much I paid for it, and asked how it was fair that I paid full and only getting back half. 

After going back and forth, I gave up and took my gift card with the lower amount. I still never understood how that could possibly be their policy. 

Edit: I did email the company the next day. The website kind of sent me on a scavenger hunt trying to find the way to report the whole ordeal. I eventually got an automated reply that sent me on another scavenger hunt, this time with a number to call. I got the typical ‘lines are busy please hold’ just to be transferred somewhere else and put back on hold... you all know how that goes. Wasn’t worth it to me at that point.

Currently I live in the southern U.S., land of southern hospitality. I say that is a lie. Anyway numerous times throughout my stay in this horrible land I've had the worst service ever. 

Without getting into specifics, I've waited over an hour to see a waitress or waiter at a restaurant. I've been blown off by customer service personnel. Etc. Usually the attitude from the service people is annoyed or inconvenienced by my presence. I've lived in a few different states and in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

I was about 8 or 9 at the time, and my sister was 7 or 8. It was right before Halloween, and my mom took my sister and I to a well known party store to pick up things for my sister's birthday party. We were hosting a Halloween-themed party for her in a few days, so my mom wanted to get the rest of the decorations and things for the goodie bags that day so we wouldn't be rushing out last minute.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my sister has cerebral palsy (CP). CP is similar to disorders like Autism where not everyone exhibits the disorder the same way. We've met other kids with CP who are able to walk with a minor limp but have more cognitive impairments since CP is a brain injury. My sister cannot walk, so she uses a wheelchair to get around. At the time, she was in a manual chair that my mom would push. Since she used a wheelchair, that meant needed to use a ramp to get into the store.

&amp;#x200B;

So we park the car and get out and head up to the store. There was a delivery truck parked out front directly in front of the curb cut in front of the store which essentially blocked our access to the store. My mom went up to ask the driver or one of the delivery men if they would move, but they refused. So, not wanting to wait around for 30 minutes for them to finish up, my mom tilted my sister's chair back to get her chair over the curb. Unfortunately, the clasp on her seat belt popped open and my sister fell out of the chair onto the pavement. My mom started yelling for help and thankfully, someone got one of the employees who came out to see what was going on. This girl was absolutely wonderful. She called an ambulance for us as well as waited with us for them to arrive. She even helped keep me occupied while my mom was dealing with my sister, who's face looked to be very torn up.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister ended up with a bruised face just in time for picture day, her birthday, and Halloween. Half of her face was all wrapped up and she was miserable.

We all live together but we both work shifts and so we take turns with our daughter as would be expected.

Me and D finish shopping and come up to the cashier, nothing much in the trolley. Cat and dog food, milk and a few other bits. Now D is brilliant and always sings or says hello to people when we are out and is very social. Cashier sees this and smiles saying hello. Then out of nowhere says ‘where’s mummy? Are you stuck with daddy today?’ 

I don’t register what she just said straight away and D is pointing at me saying ‘Daddy, daddy here’ saying I’m her dad and we are shopping. The cashier then carries on saying ‘ohh it’s not the same with daddies is it?’ So I respond with ‘how is it not the same? Her mum is working and we have many days together.’ 

Her actual response then is ‘well mummies are better than daddies. Mummies do all the hard work while daddies go out and drink dirty beer.’ Actually can’t believe she’s saying this so I explain how I don’t drink or pretty much have any night life anymore since she was born. I follow up saying at the end of the day a parent is a parent who will provide and do all they can for their children regardless of gender and how does she know I’m not a single dad or a widow? 

She doesn’t acknowledge anything I’m saying while people in the queue are looking awkward and giggling to themselves. All she’s doing is scanning the last items and making baby noises to D.

A few years ago my sister and I decided to combine our savings  and buy a house together to get on the ladder. The plan was to live together for a few years and then sell up and go our separate ways with hopefully enough profit for us both to put down a deposit on our next house.

We decided two weeks ago to put our house on the market. We decided on a Saturday and emailed three estate agents to book valuations. Estate agent 1 (ES1) emailed back within an hour and we arranged a viewing for the Sunday.  The guy who came round was great, he gave us some tips on small improvements that would increase our sale chances and gave honest answers about his companies pricing etc.  We told him we were getting a second opinion and he was absolutely fine with this.

Estate agent 2 (ES2) called back on the Monday and arranged a viewing for the Tuesday.  ES2 spent the whole visit talking about how good his company was and how many sales they make each month but didn’t actually answer any of our questions and refused to tell us what rate commission his company charges.  He also had a go at us for daring to get a second opinion, as apparently we should ‘just trust him’.  He promised to send us a report and pricing list on the Wednesday and then call on the Thursday to chat.

Estate agent 3 (ES3) told us the earliest they could do a viewing was the following week so we just cancelled them.

Come Wednesday no report from ES2.  On Thursday no phone call but we get a letter that’s hand delivered by someone banging on our back door at 8pm at night saying that we’ll get the report Monday.  We decide we’ve had enough of their unprofessionalism so contacted ES1 and said we wanted to go ahead.  Within 48 hours our house was photographed, our ad was live, and a ‘for sale’ sign was up.

Come Monday ES2 finally calls back.  We still have not had a report from them or any details on their fees.  We explain we’ve gone with ES1 and the guy blows his lid. He starts going on about how terrible ES1 is, how great his company is, what a mistake we’re making etc.  He ends the phone call with ‘well I guess I’ll speak to you again when you call me back after ES1 %#^*s up your sale’!

Since then ES2 and ES3 have both called several more times. Every time they’ve insulted ES1 and each other including several uses of profanity.  We’ve also had estate agents we never contacted ring/write to us offering their services.  The best one was a letter that just said ‘Dear sir/madam. Please call (number) and quote (reference). Many thanks. (Estate agent).  I can understand chasing potential business but the back stabbing and complete lack of professionalism astounds me!

Our house has been on the market two weeks now. ES1 has been great, we’ve had several viewings and one tentative offer subject to mortgage approval.  But ES2 is still calling/writing every few days demanding to know if we’re ready to switch to his company yet! 

Are all estate agents this unprofessional?  I run my own business and if I lose a job I reply with ‘I’m sorry to hear that, let me know if I can help you in the future’.  I’d never dream of openly insulting a competitor like that.  Anyway rant over, thanks for reading!

Today I get a call from the third party billing service for the doctors I saw demanding $7k and claiming my insurance hadn’t paid. They tell me I must call my insurance to find out why they haven’t paid.

Me: wait, isn’t there someone there to do this?

Rep: it’s your insurance, you need to deal with it

Me: okay, can I speak to a manager?

Rep puts me on hold and I get hung up on. So I call my insurance, and talk to a familiar contact who asks me the same thing. Why am I calling and I tell her. Surprise, surprise. They’ve been paid and was paid the middle of January, and the check has been cashed already. 

So I call the company back, armed with check numbers, amounts and when they were sent. I’m told that i must provide copies of the check. 

Me: how can I do that? My insurance already paid you.

Rep: we haven’t gotten it yet. If you can’t provide proof, we’ll send you to collections

I call back the insurance and the same rep answers (my insurance is through my husbands union, so it’s not uncommon to get the same person). She puts me on hold, conferences me in to the billing service and proceeds to find out why they’re threatening me with collections when they apparently can’t get their bills sent in a timely manner. 

Suddenly, the payment is found. My account is good.  All I owe is less than $100 since I hit my deductible last year with my hospital stay.  

Edit: husband pointed out we have the EOB from his union, and all the bills from this third party company have been paid. We totaled it up that we owe a balance of about $200 or so. He has really good insurance, and we hit our deductible when I went into the hospital. Now we just have to figure where to get $20k for the amount we owe. His family has offered to help with a go fund me or something like that.

Edit 2: now the balance is down to $2k, and they’re still saying I owe this. Welfare says I don’t and if the billing service would get their act together, they’d know not to contact me.

Everything was going great and the food was delicious as always. Then out of nowhere my dad feels something on his arm and looks over and it’s a huge cockroach. He gets up and swipes it off his arm and then tries to find it so he can kill it. This restaurant is really dark and there is crazy decor everywhere so he couldn’t see where it went.

Almost every server comes up to my dad and ask what is wrong as they thought my dad had lost something or was having a heart attack. The second my dad mentions a bug almost everyone immediately disappears. My dad doesn’t wanna make a scene because I get embarrassed easily so he sits back down and we continue to eat dinner. 

My dad barely touched his food and continues to look around all night in fear this bug will come back. Still no manager or anyone has come to talk to us even though my dad told almost all of the servers that a bug was on him. All that was offered was to move tables.

Me and my boyfriend are sitting directly across from the bar where we can see their food score rating and it is an 86. Which to me was a RED FLAG as some of the fast food restaurants I frequent usually have a 99-100. This restaurant is very pricey and high end so I was in shock to see a B food score and was honestly kinda disgusted. Of course it was hidden in the back of the restaurant as well. 

Once my boyfriend mentions the score my dad decides to get up and ask for the manager just to let him know there was a cockroach that was still alive in the restaurant. The manager told my dad “oh the bugs are coming from the bar next door.” Which tells me this has been an ongoing issue before. They end up comping our entire meal which was around $500. 

I was honestly super embarrassed because my dad told them multiple times they didn’t have to do that and that’s not what he wanted. My dad works in hospitality and is in HR so he is the nicest guy around and never complains about anything. But in his 55 years he has never had an incident like that happen to him and as a grown man I have never seen my dad so rattled by a bug.

I went on a shopping trip, minding my own business and just having a chill day. One of the stores I went into was a body care shop with creams and lotions and things like that. I start looking around on the shelves when the sales woman (SW) came up to me.

SW: Hi! Are you finding what you’re looking for or can I help you with anything?

Me: Oh, I’m just looking around. I’ll let you know if I need any help. Thank you. 

I gave her a smile and turned back to the shelf I was previously looking at. But she didn’t move and started looking at products aswell. Then she took out a small perfume bottle and sprayed some on herself. This is where I started getting wierded out because something in her face changed. You know when the look in someomes eyes change when they change mood all of a sudden.

SW: This is my favourite. Doesn’t it smell good?

Me: Ah, yes I guess it does. 

SW: I would steal this! It smells that good.

She proceeds to laugh a little and fake put it in her pocket.

Me: Umm, okay?

SW: Which one would you steal if you could?

My head just went blank. I was getting really uncomfortable and wanted to get away so I slowly made my way to the door.

Me: I wouldn’t steal anything. I don’t do that. 

SW: I know, but if you could - which one would it be?

She takes out another perfume bottle and sprays it on herself. On top of the last one. I just stay silent, still trying to make my way to the door.

SW: This one smells good too. Would you take this?

Me: Eh, no.

She laughs again and I manage to leave, confused as all hell. She didn’t say it in a way that sounded like she thought that I did steal anything, or as a joke. She said it like she genuinly wanted to know. Like it was a normal conversation.

Travelling in the US, I found that I didn't much like American Thai food as it tended to involve a lot of peanuts and prawns, neither of which I particularly liked at that time (I've since come to appreciate prawns). There came a day when the group wanted Thai and I was forced to go along with it.

So, we settled ourselves in a restaurant and when my time to order came around, not being familiar with most of the menu, I asked, 'What do you have without peanuts or prawns?'

'I'll get the manager', the server replied and harried off. 

Some minutes later, the manager came over to me and almost obsequiously apologised for being unable to provide a kitchen free of peanuts and prawns. I was confused. Why was this an issue? Surely not *everything* on the menu contained them? 

'Surely, you must have something without one or the other,' I persisted?

Again he apologised profusely, explaining that his kitchen was too small and he couldn't guarantee that it was free of allergens.

Finally, it clicked. 'Oh,' I said. 'I'm not allergic. I just don't like them.'

He stared at me, horrified. Then he asked me to repeat myself.

'I'm not allergic. I just don't like them.' 

The manager harried back to the kitchen and my group explained to me that faking allergies is apparently a 'thing' in the US. Well, that's odd, I thought, thinking that we were done. But no...

After a few minutes, the cook stalks over to the table. In broken english he begins to explain to me all of the places in his kitchen that may harbour peanuts and prawns. I am confused. I repeat, 'I'm not allergic, I just don't like them.'

He pauses for a moment, but persists, do my lips tingle if I eat them, he asks?

'No, I just don't like them,' I huff, beginning to get annoyed.

He lets out a heartfelt sigh and sighs almost beatifically. 'I just wanted to hear someone say it,' he says. 'Thank you.'

So he asks me to go with him and help him chose, we sifted thru the offers to match his price range and decided on three makes. Korean, american and german.

We went to the korean and american dealership first, and they were outstanding, I mean the best. Seconds after entering the door, a salesmen walked us thru everything, options, warranty, maintenance prices etc. I never though that two guys wearing jeans and t-shirts could get so much attention, all the other costumers in the saloons were wearing suits and honestly we were standing out, but we were taken care of in a very polite and professional way.

And then we went to the german dealership. Right from the start we felt like we are invisible, no one to great us, to ask if we need help, nothing. My friend went to a group of salespeople and asked if he can get some information of the price and the options and they looked at each other like my friend was breaking up their conversation.
A guy walked to us, and with the most bored voice in the world basically read what the information leaflet said. I was ready to ask few questions, but my friend said Thank you, and said we are leaving.

His reaction was completely understandable, it was clear that those guys were not going to put even a little effort to help.

My friend bought the american car, and is very happy with his choice, but the thing is that he was very keen on buying a german car. Oh well, it is their loss.

Saturday I decided to do some drunk streaming, and went to the store to get cider.  When I was checking out, the cashier asked me what year I was born in. I an definitely over 21, and told him the year.  

He then finished the transaction without asking for my ID.  After I paid, I pointed out he didn't ask for my ID, So he replied with, oh, can I see it?  

I told him he could, but that wasn't the point, and that I am under 40, and wanted my 40 dollars.  He then made a huge production about it, told me I had to wait for his manager, and in general got really rude with me.

We were basically snowed into our houses for several days, and even once roads were better, many still couldn't move their cars due to the piles of snow in driveways from snowplows.
Anyway, after several days snowed in, I had to get to a store to try an get milk for my 3 kids, or at the very least, formula for my infant.
I am doing the best I can for my kids, but am still in need of SNAP and WIC. It just so happens my WIC checks were all I had til my next check, and anyone who lived thru this mess knows, grocery stores were cleaned out and lines were LONG. Even at 10pm when I managed to get to the store.
Anyone who has used WIC knows they can take painfully long to ring up and each transaction stupidly has to be separate.
I had a whole ISLE OF PEOPLE waiting behind me to get my formula, milk, baby food, etc. 4 seperate transactions total.
I had no other means to pay, and had not been able to make it to the store any sooner. I was at the bottom of my last formula can, so I had to get it. 
I apologized for the annoyance of the WIC check to the cashier, and the person immediately behind me, as I always do. I know it's stupidly time consuming and inconvenient.
And then the comments came part way thru the second transaction.
""Great, we get to pay for your food and have to wait to get ours too?""
""Lady, get a job, keep your legs closed, and get lost""
This was enough for the cashier, she calmly called for a manager. After she quietly elaborated over the phone, she suspended my transaction and laid into the salty old dude....
I'm sobbing and apologizing a bunch now....to everyone in line who can hear anyway.
Cashier ""hey buddy, I have a job, and I'm married, and I USE WIC CHECKS! "" 
The manager showed up and asked him to leave and told him they could refuse service to anyone.
He walked out screaming red, and tried to take his cart of groceries without paying! Other people in line kept him from taking his cart....

I was clenching my teeth trying not to cry more...but yea, it was awful. My jaw ached for awhile afterwards.
The manager jumped on my cashiers terminal and let her talk to me. My cashier GAVE me her milk (the store had been out, so in desperation I had just grabbed a gallon of lactaid because it was better than no milk for cereal)
She had stashed her groceries to take home when she was off work, so she just gave me two gallons of milk. She walked me to my car to help me load up and make sure the asshat wasn't out there waiting to harass me more.
I cried the whole way home, not just because of how mortifying the whole experience was, and how ashamed I felt, but because this cashier was so kind. Not once did she treat me like a ""customer"" it was more like she was defending a friend.
I go to this grocery store often, and I can't wait to find a way to pay her back for her kindness.

471,Zezarict,0,t3_as95oe,7,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/as95oe/psychologists_doing_a_great_job_of_upping_my/,"This happened recently. Quick backstory. I'm 23 and have had a very touch time finding a job because I have some nerve problems with my feet. Basically they will very quickly start to hurt if I'm on them. Because of this, I've had an extremely rough time finding a job, but finally I found one. But the conditions weren't exactly amazing.

Because it was over 3 hours of commuting every day, because they themselves admitted that the job was very stressful, and it being my first job and it was straight to full time as well as problems at home....it was extremely stressful. But I carried on. My work was surprisingly helpful though. And during the time all this was going on, I got paid leave.

 They recommended me to an EAP (some kind of service that you call and they get you psychologist appointments with the psychologists and groups that work with them). Work also recommended I go home that day. I called them up and arranged for an appointment in a certain area. I listed off about 8 towns in my area within reasonable driving distance and they said they'd get back to me with one. 

Few hours later on the train ride home I get a a call back, saying I have an appointment in x town with y psychologist at 10AM on Thursday. Seemed easy enough. But I later get a text message from y psychological service saying they have received my referral and I had to call to make an appointment. Far as I knew, the appointment was already made. But I call anyway, and after talking to them for a while, they insist that I DON'T have an appointment at that time. 

So I call back EAP and then end up just being thrown between the EAP and the psychological service all day. EAP insisting that the Psychological Service confirmed I had an appointment and the Psychological Service insisting that I didn't. It didn't end up sorted out that day.

But...my work assumed I would get the appointment the next day. They said to go to the appointment and come back the next day. But the appointment on Thursday was actually 2 days away. I tried and failed to contact work. So I took the commute and went to work tomorrow anyway. I still didn't know if I had an appointment.

I get there and we both call up and talk to the EAP and Psychologist. In the end, I didn't have the appointment. So we make another one through the EAP, asking it once again to be in those 8 or so towns in my area. I more quickly get a call back this time while still at work and they give me a town that was not in those 8 listed towns. It was physically impossible for me to make it in time, I had them cancel that appointment and insisted on those 8 towns. I get a call back and they say that they do have an appointment in those listed towns for a good time. I thank them and then later on head home.

While on the train home, I get an email from the EAP to confirm the appointment...but the appointment they contacted me with was the cancelled appointment that I could not get to. I call them up about this and they insist that I did not cancel the appointment, and there was no appointment available anytime soon for those listed towns. There's back and forth again. And I got the appointment cancelled. Again. I ask for another appointment.

At home, I finally get a call and it turns out some kind of magic happened and there IS an appointment now. Not only was it soon, but it was even in my town, not the surrounding ones. Woo. I call up them to confirm and I do indeed have the appointment. I thank them and then breathe a sigh of relief. I end up going. They just had me stare at the top of a pointer for a whole hour. Did nothing for me. But that's a story for another day.

Cherry on top, the ORIGINAL psychologists who insisted I didn't have an appointment ended up calling me and somewhat berating me for not going to my appointment...even though they insisted I didn't have it.

I then hold up the phone for her to scan and she’ll do the rest in silence. Or most recently today, I asked for 50g of a certain tobacco. She put 30g through the till so I said no I’d like 50, please. She grunted at me that they don’t have 50.

If you've ever been to this store, you know peoples' level of awareness and personal space is pretty much at ""epic fail"" levels.

I was maneuvering my cart toward a checkout line and saw an opening to get through to a line that didn't look too long, so I took it.  There was another customer (who shall be known as BL for ""black lady,"" because that's all I know about her, except that she's apparently kind of a cunt) coming in a perpendicular direction, so I said ""excuse me!"" as I attempted to cut through.  I ended up accidentally hitting the side of her cart (rather gently, I might add).

She obviously did not hear me, as she asked ""Really?  Was that necessary?""  To which I answered ""Yes, and I said excuse me.""

BL: ""Well, you didn't need to slam into my cart.""

Me: ""Look, lady, I'm just trying to get through here.""

BL: ""Your racism is showing.""

Me: ""Yeah, well, you can take your inferiority complex and shove it somewhere.  I'm just trying to get through here.""

What I wish I had said was ""Oh, really?  Would you say that about me if I was black?""

Literally, the only thing she knew about me was that I was white, and she assumed that because I did something that annoyed her a little bit, that it was racially motivated.

Which I understand, it was stupid of me but it was a genuine accident and I’m on birth control, I just wanted to be sure. She laughed at me when I had questions and made me feel so much more paranoid than I was before. She wouldn’t even really address my questions, she just wanted me to get out of there ASAP. I was pretty upset by the end up it and was already tearing up because I was freaking out about needing to be there in the first place and needed an adult to tell me I was fine because I could not talk to someone like my parents. 

I finally got to leave and my boyfriend was in the waiting room fuming when I came out. Turns out the woman at the front desk had leaned over to him and said “wow. That looks like an expensive watch for not being able to pay for the Plan B” which in my opinion is extremely uncalled for and very inappropriate because that is not what that place stands for. He got that nice fucking watch as a gift!!! He did not buy it!! On top of that he had literally offered the bitch 20$ to pay for what he could and she turned it down!!!!! She was the one who said it would be free if I got a checkup!!!! That place is supposed to be somewhere for people to go in and receive care and support when they need help. The woman behind the desk then went on to address past patients BY NAME in front of other people complaining how cheap they are for saying they can’t pay for the Plan B. She was doing this very loud and exposing other people’s names which are supposed to stay confidential. 

We are fairly young and made a stupid mistake completely on accident and were trying to get the help and reassurance we both desperately needed. I am lucky to have a boyfriend who is very supportive and would not leave me there alone. It helped that he was there but we both left there more nervous and upset than we were before and then my boyfriend told me what happened I started crying in the car and he had to pull over to talk to me. It was easily the worst experience I have ever had and I was just trying to be responsible. I am not stupid, I just made a dumb mistake and was trying to use the resources I had to prevent an even worse outcome. I am looking into my options to complain because if they shamed me for something like this I can’t imagine who else they have done this to.

So today I went with my mom and grandmother to find a prom dress for my junior prom! I was really excited. We tried a few stores and didn’t really see anything we liked that much, so we went to this local store my mom had heard about.

We walk in and an older man greets us, Says welcome and asks for my name so he can write us down on the waitlist for a dressing room. He tells us were about 3rd in line for a room and to look around and find some dresses. 

All is good and I find a few I like, and one I REALLY like. Like this dress was beautiful. The older man asks us to give him the dresses he picked out and he’ll put them in a dressing room for us, cool! He also points us over to some dresses on the wrack he says just came in today, then just kind of shuffles away.

So me and my mom and grandma are all waiting by the wrack for him to come get us for about 20 ish minutes. He finally walks over, and the conversation unfolds somewhat like this

Old guy: Alright, so these dresses are yours yes? *points to dresses on the rack he says just came in*

My mom: Umm no. none of those are the ones she picked out.

OG: Are you sure?? These are not yours??

Mom: No... you said those just came in today

OG: Well I put her dresses on this rack

Mom: Well they aren’t there?

OG: Go look around and try to find dresses you like.

Mom: We did and we gave them to you! I thought you said we had a dressing room? 

OG: Let me go look

The old guy goes over to an old woman and they talk. the old woman then comes over and tells me to go look around for dresses I like and they will try to “find them”

I look and find the one I really loved, but a size too small. We try to find a dressing room and notice that people who arrived after us have a room and we dont. A really nice girl who was working and a nice family let me go into their room really quick to try on the dress. The man notices this and talks to the old woman whos running who goes into the dressing room and says “its not my fault! i cant keep up with all these brats.” 

The family and girls helping them were very very sweet. I try it on and dont like how it fits and put it back and keep looking. The same old woman comes up to me.

Old Woman: Didn’t like the dress?

Me: No I really liked it.. its just too small

Old Woman: Yeah, thats why you need to find one that fits.

My grandma: She did. and that gentleman lost her dress.

at this point i’m tearing up and just want to leave because I dont want to make a scene. I felt horrible. We looked all over the store a few times and couldn’t find any of the dresses I had picked out. The old guy kept just going through the motions of looking but not actually looking and that upset me. My mom was getting angry so I said we should just go. 

We leave the shop dress less and im really upset, but we find another dress store with a super helpful girl who didnt leave my side once and I found an even better dress for cheaper then the one that was at the store :) 

I know this is kind of petty but I felt really upset at the time. 

TL;DR I go to a dress shop for prom and they lose all the dresses i picked out and are rude, but then I go to a different one and get a beautiful dress for even less! :) ",1,Prom Dress Fiasco,965
482,loljkbye,0,t3_arp14i,0,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/arp14i/cafe_customer_insults_everyone_for_no_reason/,"So this is the story of an entitled customer from the view of myself, another customer. I have a friend who worked at that cafe though, and I can tell you, you get all sorts of people walking through the door there.

See bottom for TL;DR.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene**: Cafe order counter in french and english speaking city. This is a very diverse area of town and not everyone speaks both English and French. More often than not, they speak one or the other as a second language only, but every employee was very polite and understanding of language barriers.

**Characters**:

\-E (Employee)  
\-C (Customer)  
\-Me (Me of course)  
\-E2: A second employee working at the coffee station.

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened in July, but I wrote it down as it was too good to forget about. I had just ordered something at that cafe and was waiting for my order, when this guy walks in. He's dressed all in white and is carrying a small cooler, like a lunchbox. He's also really dirty. Probably a construction worker. This guy only speaks english, which is fine, but it can make interactions more complicated. Now, I am bilingual and was standing right next to the guy. I'm closer to him than the employee behind the counter, and I can barely hear him.

&amp;#x200B;

So the guys starts ordering, and right away he. is. just. R-U-D-E. Seemingly for no reason.

**C:** \*Mumbles incoherently\* \*Mumbles something about coffee, 3 sugars, 3 creams\* \*Mumbles under his breath\* Loudly: And NO GRAFFITI on the LID. NO GRAFFITI. NO WRITING!

**E (In very broken english, but politely):** I'm sorry, can you repeat please?

**C:** \*Mumbles the order again, but a little louder, never looking at E.\*

E charges C for his order and tells him to wait next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

In that specific cafe, they write little codes on the lid, especially in rush hour, so that they don't mix up the orders. It's in white crayon and you can easily wipe it off.

So a second employee pours C's coffee (as they would do during rush hour because it's faster to work in a chain.) And to C'S HORROR, there is a little ""3s3c"" written on the lid.

**C:** \*Mumbles incoherently in the direction of E2, who is trying his best to understand him.\*

**Me (In french to the E2):** I think he didn't want you to write on the lid.

E2 apologizes profusely and switches the lid for a fresh one saying he is sorry for misunderstanding C, but THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR C, OH NO NO SIR! He starts YELLING, and I quote:

**C:** *You people* never listen!

Now, may I add, if you didn't catch the hint, neither of the employees were white. AND didn't speak english nor french as a first language. So, yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, people are yelling, E2 is standing his ground (props to him), the manager shows up, it's chaos. And in the middle of things, knowing it's going to make C mad but I was feeling especially anti-bull\*\*\*\*\*y that day:

**Me:** Sir, you were being rude the minute you walked in.

To which he responds, red with rage (and again I quote):  
***""GO F\*\*\* YOURSELF, YOU F\*\*\*ING C\*\*T!""***

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, I couldn't hold my laughter in and said:

**Me:** You're f\*\*\*ing ridiculous, I love you!

I took my sandwich and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, I went back inside to get a cup of water and a muffin and chatted with E about how crazy that guy was and he gave me a chocolate croissant on the house (""and everyone clapped"" style).

&amp;#x200B;

Extra: Flashforward to when I told this story to my friend who is an ex cafe employee. She told me ""Good job on being so calm, I have a fist full of rings that would have flown into his face on its own.""

To which I responded ""My secret is that I'm a f\*\*\*ing p\*\*\*y.""

&amp;#x200B;

484,clpe,0,t3_arji3n,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/arji3n/owner_treats_employees_like_shit/,"I was at a bubble tea store this morning and they’d opened like 5 minutes before I got there and I ordered 3 drinks. As someone who works in the food industry I do know that despite all efforts, sometimes things aren’t always ready at opening, especially when you have a massive menu like most bubble tea places do. 

Anyway, the girl who takes my order is obviously relatively new (she didn’t know one of the drinks I ordered) but she was super nice because I’d never been there before so I kinda didn’t know what to order either and I think I confused her quite a bit (great customer service there!)

So as I’m waiting for the drinks to be made, a man, who I’m guessing is the owner, walks in, wearing sunglasses and decked head to toe in designer clothes and accessories (think Chanel bag, Gucci belt, Balenciaga top) and doesn’t say hi to the two employees working (which just isn’t Aussie culture tbh). Instead he says “Why isn’t the music on?” 

Now keep in mind, they’re both busy trying to get my drinks out quickly and so having to stop and get the music playing isn’t something that they’re keen on doing. But the girl who took my order stops what she’s doing and turns on the music. Then the owner(?) asks why aren’t they wearing aprons and I don’t hear the girl’s answer but I can see he’s not happy with it but seeing as they didn’t immediately put on aprons I guess they didn’t have any. 

The owner leaves them be after that, and walks around the store, doesn’t greet me (which tbh is fine with me though you would expect an owner would greet a customer) and begins taking pictures of a pile of flattened cardboard boxes tucked away in a corner, as well as a roll of garbage bags next to a sink. 

He beckons the girl over and starts telling her off for the “mess” really loudly and makes her clean it up. In my opinion, there was no mess. The boxes were stacked neatly in a back corner away from where customers are and the sink is behind the counter so I doubt I would notice it. 

All the while, he continues to berate the two employees loudly, and takes pictures of what he deems unacceptable. Also, he had his sunglasses on the whole time. Indoors. While talking to people. 

IMO, it’s fine for owners and mangers to have standards which they hold their employees to, and standards about how the store should look, but I don’t think that they should basically yell at employees, especially when there’s a customer around. 

I really regret not filming him to shame him. 

If I worked for him, I would quit because if I have to put up with shit from customers, I don’t need to put up with shit from my boss too.

I saw another post about prom dresses and that reminded me of my senior year in High School. I apologize if it’s a bit sketchy on details, it’s been 5 years since so I don’t really remember dialogue.

My mom, best friends, and I went to browse the garment district in hopes of finding cute cheap prom dresses. We had gone to several stores with little to no luck. We finally found a store that had beautiful dresses. This dress store was owned by an older grumpy-looking  man. We had picked out a few dresses to try out and patiently waited in line for the dressing room.

While waiting, another teenage girl, her mother, and grandma come in The store also looking for a dress. She spends some time browsing the dresses before finding one she liked. Here’s where is goes south. She asked for the dress in a certain size. He gives her a look before asking her if she can even afford the dresses.

The mother and grandma looked absolutely insulted (rightly so). All the women inside (It was a lot of moms with their daughters) the store started calling him an asshole for making an assumption like that and arguing with him for treating them like that. 

This man was being stubborn about how he “doesn’t want to waste his time if they couldn’t afford it.” After this comment, most of the women in the story left, because his crappy attitude. 

Honestly I shocked, he didn’t want to give her the time of day because she looked like she couldn’t afford it. Who does that?? Luckily I found a beautiful black and red prom dress at another store not run by a jerk. ",1,"You Look Poor, Don’t Waste My Time",133

I realize this is a lot of money which needs extra security measures, I had to give my address, social security number, photo of id, photo of me now, all of my bank details including account user and password, and a few more things. 

Now after this I get an email saying to call to confirm or the transaction may not be approved. So I call and they ask me a bunch of irrelevant questions, like are you married, where are you now, how often will you use “zoom”. The thing that really threw me is they needed a phone bill. 

Now I don’t have my american phone bill, I’m in the uk and that phone has been given to my dad along with the number. For all verification purposes I assumed they would text the number to confirm whatever they needed right? 

Nope. It HAD to be the phone bill. I told them it wasn’t in my name anymore and they said it didn’t matter, they still needed it. I asked what this was verifying and they said “we are not allowed to disclose our processes and reasons for security checks”.  

So I asked if you could make an account without a phone number, and they said yes. So I asked if I could do that and they told me no. 

So now a company that is endorsed by “paybuddy” has all of my details and they don’t even allow accounts being deleted. I swear this is nuts.

Went to a store with my boyfriend because he needed work pants and a belt for his new job. They had a sale going on, buy two pants, get one free. 

His belt was $35. 
Two pants for $32, one for $44. One of the pairs that was $32 was free. So the total should’ve been ~$120. I noticed she scanned the belt at the beginning of the transaction, then again at the end (she looked at the computer confused so I’m assuming she thought the first scan didn’t go through). 

Cashier: Your total is $160.
Bf: How? One of these should be free. 
C: Yeah that’s the total without the third pair. Do you want me to check it again? 
*calls coworker over*
C: This is right with the discount right??
Coworker: Yeah you took the third pair off, it’s right. 
*Bf decided to leave the belt*
C: Ok your new total is $120. 
Me: That can’t be right. He’s technically only paying for two pairs of pants so it should be ~$80???
Bf: It’s ok just leave it. 

We walk out of the store but I look over the receipt and explain to him where she fucked up and go back in and show her the receipt. 

Me: The total should be ~$80, you charged the belt twice and only took one of those charges off. 
C: I’ll be back. 
*comes back with manager*
C: They got these three pairs of pants, but I took off one pair for the discount (doesn’t even mention the belt)
Manager: What about the belt?
C: They didn’t want it so I took it off. 
Manager: But if you had taken it off, it wouldn’t be on the receipt. So you didn’t take it off. 
C: But the computer said it voided??
Manager: Ok well it’s still there sooooo you didn’t void it.

We subtly mentioned again that she charged the belt twice, but she wasn’t listening to us and kept arguing. My bf just asks if he can just take the belt how he originally wanted since he was still charged for it.

Manager puts the belt in the bag and tells us to have a good day. We turn to walk away and I hear the cashier still going at it. “But the first total was $160, so I took SOMETHING off!”

(Side note: at the time this occurred I was a little under 300 pounds and was fit, duffus was a 200 pound piece of flubber) I then told him “I will call the police and have an officer come down.” His reply was but I do that after I question them!” I told him “no that is not how it works you “f’ing” moron!” At this time the manager had come out since someone tipped him off to what was happening. He spoke up and said “OK call the Cops but they have to come inside!” I replied Cops yes inside NO! How do I know if you and “F” head are not kiddie diddlers! My nieces will stay right here until the Cops and their parents arrive!” I am guessing the laughter from the 10 or so people watching this made him think twice so he did nothing.

Officer goes “OK” and goes over to Store staff to confer; he comes back a few minutes later and asks if it is OK to check their bag/receipt and have a female officer check their pants pockets since he claimed they stuffed it in their pockets; I agree; cop compares receipt and bag, officer checks the pockets – Nothing. At this point officer tells them they have nothing not on the receipt and he needs to see the video of the theft.

So me and my friends order via a service, lets call is mailfriends, for a vegetarian/vegan chinese restaurant. My friends have a lot of dietary restrictions and love how good this place is, so we were all really excited. We ordered 2 meals, 2 soups, and 2 appetizers. The meals come with rice and salad.

Mailfriends delivery man gets here, comes up without a problem, and is super nice overall. We grab the food, wish him goodnight, and then unpack it. As we unpack it we realize we are missing the rice, salads, and 2 appetizers. Of course we go to call back the delivery guy, and come to realize that mailfriends has no way of supporting customers once food is delivered. No phone to call, and they immediately disconnect you and your driver as soon as it arrives. You have to put in a ticket to get a response via email.

So, because we’re not idiots, we call the restaurant, thinking maybe they can help. I call and I don’t have to give a name, an order number, or anything. I just say “mailfriends” and the guy immediately explains what happens: the delivery man only picks up one of two bags (honest mistake). The restaurant immediately calls mailfriends, and mailfriends tells them they cannot contact the driver or send out another until we contact them with a ticket (which we already have). He generously offers to try and reimburse us by taking the charge off of mailfriends. However, we dont receive a refund until mailfriends notices our ticket and the refund to them from the restaurant. Then, maybe, they refund us.

This happened a couple of years ago but I've been reading ""Valentine's day edition"" posts and realized i actually have one to share. I have also never worked for tips but i have worked in fast food and gas stations so i try to be extra patient with waitstaff. Sorry for the length.

 A few years ago, when we were still babyless my husband and i decided to go out for dinner on Valentine's day. I told my hubs that we should expect a wait because duh. He was good with it and we went to a local, family owned and run Chinese pleace that we really enjoyed when we went before.
We walked in and there were a few families seated and literally ONE waitress was hosting, waiting, cashing out, and busing.

We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. I like to actively people watch and noticed a family of 5 sitting at a table with their drinks. The mother was channeling her inner Karen and being really mean to the waitress. 

Once we were seated we got our drinks and ordered fairly quickly. Our waitress mentioned something about having only 2 cooks in the back so it may take awhile. 

We were sat right next to the family so i could hear Karen complaining the entire time. After about 10 minutes Karen is fuming and tells her husband and kids that its been an hour and theyre leaving. They didnt pay for their drinks and just left.

Around this same time a 20 something year old girl comes in for her Bridget Jones-esque Valentine's meal. She asks about eggdrop soup and was told they were out, which i believe had been explained over the phone when the order was placed. Omg, you would have thought leggings were being outlawed with how this chick reacted. She argued with the waitress for about 10 minutes as the waitress explained they didn't even have the ingredients to make more. The girl huffed and puffed and called her roommate (I'm assuming) to tell her that it would take longer. She was also loudly insulting the waitress while on the phone and being really disruptive, in general.

We did wait about an hour for our food, but we saw that our waitress was alone and when we did get our food it was hot. We didnt have any plans so we didn't mind the wait. 

After my hubs and i finished our food we decided to leave a large tip like $100 on a $30 ticket because of the trainwreck the evening was for the poor waitress and because we knew the chick and Karen didn't leave a tip. She had been so busy she hadnt even been able to bus Karen's table and she looked positively exhausted.

I went out with my wife last night for dinner. We had a reservation, the restaurant was jammed, and they were running about a half hour late. I can deal with that on a busy night, so no worries.

Then we were put in our seats, which was a small table in a very busy area beside an aisle that connects the bar area and kitchen to the rest of the restaurant. Normally I would have asked for another table, but given we had waited so long I decided to just take it.

And this brings up my whole reason for posting. Staff, do not fucking touch or bump my chair every time you walk past me. Literally I was probably jostled between 20 and 30 times during dinner. Sometimes it was someone just laying their hand on the back of my chair as they walked past, sometimes it was someone's hip clipping the chair. I am pretty sure that nobody realized what they were doing was so annoying, but when you add that all together for all staff, it really ruins the night.

Everything else was good, the food was great, we were comped drinks because of the wait (and the fact that the waitress was so busy that she initially forgot our drink order, then brought my wife's drink and apologized that she had forgotten it, then had to be reminded that I had a drink order too so she comped that too). We tipped well.

494,mandamay92,0,t3_ar6oty,2,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ar6oty/seriously_off_put_by_bakery_staff/,"There’s one bakery in town that I absolutely love, and have loved going to for years. Let’s call them Happy’s. At Happy’s I’ve always received amazing customer service. The staff are warm and friendly; they go above and beyond to make people feel welcome. 

A couple months ago a coworker was talking about a different bakery, I’ll call them Crumbs. She raved about how delicious everything from Crumbs is and makes Happy’s taste like hot garbage. I’ve never been dissatisfied with the service or treats at Happy’s, so I was super curious about this ultra amazing Crumbs. I had tried to get over to Crumbs a couple times, but always managed to go once they closed (Happy’s is open pretty late for a bakery so I forget other places have shorter hours). 

Thursday evening I decided to go to a local bookstore to pick up the next installment of my murder mystery series and I remember that Crumbs is in the same shopping center. I go in and wait in line while checking out the case. They had so many options! I thought Happy’s had a lot going on, but these guys had more and in a smaller space. Cupcakes, pies, gooey cookies, sugar cookies, macarons, cheesecakes, on and on the selection went. I was really excited about the gooey cookies because I didn’t realize a bakery in our town had any. Also while waiting, I observe how their process goes. I have really bad anxiety and like to have an idea of what to do beforehand. I saw the lady pulling and boxing orders, then handing them to the man at the register to ring up. 

Once it’s my turn the lady calls out, “I can help who’s next!” in a pretty sharp voice. I tell her what I want, and after each time I said something she gives this sigh. 

Me-“Can I get two strawberry cupcakes, please?” 

Lady-(sighs) What else?

Me- “I’d also like two vanilla cupcakes.”

Lady- (sighs) Is that all?

I ended up getting four cupcakes and four cookies of different varieties, and every single time I ordered something she sighed. As she’s boxing up, I start to the end of the counter with the register. As soon as I turn my back she says loudly, “I can ring you up down here!” I quickly pay for my treats and get the heck out of there. 

For the past 7 years I’ve worked the front desk of hotels as a guest service rep, which is just customer service by a different name. I’ve dealt with all kinds of people and when I go out I end up being almost deferential to service staff because I don’t want to cause issues. I get that the bakery was in a rush because it’s 5:30pm on Valentines Day, but I was kinda upset about how she spoke to me. At Happy’s I could be coming in during a rush or 10 minutes before close and they’ll be just as nice as if I was the only person in the shop. 

I’m really leaning towards not going back to Crumbs because the staff member made me feel like an imposition. Plus, the cupcakes and cookies weren’t even that good. Almost sickly sweet and the cupcakes got soggy bottoms.

495,choppindatmeat,0,t3_ar72t6,0,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ar72t6/a_free_apple_pie/,"This happened about two years ago with me and my then boyfriend. It’s worth noting two things: that he is absolutely addicted to a diner that sells a Very Interesting Breakfast, and we are two punk kids in our mid twenties. We don’t have obnoxious piercings, no offensive tattoos, we just dress a little differently. 

I should also point out that he is a military member. 

Anyway, we decide we’re going to celebrate the Fourth of July at this place with a Very Interesting Breakfast and then set off fireworks with our friend. I wore some blue naval pinup dress because I thought it was fitting, and he chose to wear his blue motorcycle vest to match. 

We get to this place, and everything is normal. Nobody gives us a second look. Except our waitress. My boyfriends vest has a small patch on it that says Bastard. It’s not big or obnoxious, and I couldn’t tell you why he put it on there, but I honestly forgot it was there. 

Our waitress comes by, takes one look at his vest and at myself and just laughs, at the patch, at my dress, etc. She can’t even take our order. My boyfriend asks her if there’s a problem. She says no, while still giggling, and takes our order. 

That is the last time she serviced our table. Someone else brought us our drinks about ten minutes after we ordered. Which, fine. They’re just drinks. She is around at every other table in her section, but does not come by ours at all, not even to bring us the food. To make the whole meal complete, my food is burnt. And I can’t tell her about it because she won’t check on us or even come near us. 

My boyfriend notices I’m not eating, and asks why. I show him my food, and he notices our waitress has been missing for about twenty five minutes. Everyone else has gotten their food before us, drinks refilled, but not us. 

We both agree that a word with the manager is probably in order, and we vaguely know the guy (see; addiction to this Hamlet Tavern), so my boyfriend goes and tells him we don’t want free food, we don’t want anything, but our waitress won’t give us any service, my food is burnt, and that we were deeply disappointed. He then mentioned that he was a service member, just looking to celebrate the Fourth. 

The manager apologizes, and seems highly embarassed. He offers to comp the meal, which we decline. We both were just frustrated and hungry and wanted to get on the road. So he offers us a free pie of our choice. I ended up picking apple, because it was literally America Day, who the hell wouldn’t pick it, and we left. Didn’t tip either. 

It’s not as obnoxious or bad as other stories I’ve read here, but being laughed at for a stupid dress and a stupid patch on a vest made me certain to never go back. As far as I know, she wasn’t fired, as I never returned. We ended up getting homemade bacon from my family and getting drunk while eating that and delicious apple pie. ",1,A Free Apple Pie,23

It’s been a horrible couple of days. When getting away from the man who did it, I booked a room in a hostel while panicking. 

I ended up not sleeping in the room due to being interviewed by the police for the whole day and evening, which made it too late so I got to stay with one of the detectives. Since they had a no cancellation policy I paid for the room (obviously) which was fine, but I didn’t really have the money to spare (young + traveling by myself) since I had gotten one of their more expensive rooms that had its own bed instead of a shared dorm. I ended up booking that room for another night though because I really wanted my own room and sleeping around strangers was the last thing I wanted. 

Anyway, the detective I stayed with called them and asked if they could possibly give me a refund because I was being held by the police I didn’t use the room. The hostel said it wouldn’t be possible since I booked it through another party. I honestly didn’t even care, I just wanted a safe place to sleep in so it was okay. 

When I got to the hostel the next morning to check in for the room I told her I was the girl that was being held by the police last night and I’m sorry I didn’t check in last night or let them know what was happening. She asked me if I had been arrested and I said no, I was being interviewed for something bad happening to me. She said she could possibly get me a free night but she would need some sort of story to tell her boss, so she asked me to write something down on a piece of paper. I wrote down that I had been sexually assaulted and that it had been a very bad couple of days for me but I totally understood if they couldn’t give me a free night, I didn’t really mind at that point like I said. She read the first few sentences and just said ”I read enough. I’ll get you a free night and make sure your room is ready as soon as possible” (it was only 10 am so room wasn’t supposed to be ready). I teared up and thanked her so much. She asked me if I needed anything to just call her, like a ride to the supermarket or anything at all. I can’t believe how sweet she was being.

So, I know the lady probably won’t read this but I just want to say thank you so so much. You made this experience a little less horrible for me. Thank you. 

Little update: I’m so overwhelmed by all of your nice comments and I honestly feel the best I have since it happened right now. They truly mean a lot. I can’t believe how many amazing people there are out there, and you by far make up for the shitty ones. I’ll get through this. One step at a time.

My friends and I decided to go out and have some sushi one day. There were, altogether, 7 of us. One of them was allergic to seafood, so they’d just come to tag along. However, when we got to the restaurant, I didn’t want them to just watch us eat. So, I pointed out things on the menu that didn’t have seafood on it, along with things that had minimal seafood so that they could ask the chef to take out (as you’re supposed to with a person with allergies). But, no, they just rejected it and I shrugged it off. Now, I love this place with all of my heart. The owner and I basically know each other now because of how often I visit. I didn’t want them to look at me in bad light. However, this particular friend decided to be loud and rude while we were dining. It made the rest of us really, really uncomfortable, especially since sushi restaurants like this one has a more tranquil type of setting. We told them repeatedly to settle down and be quiet, but they wouldn’t listen. They thought we had “problems” and were “angry for no reason”. The owner flashed a kind of dirty look in our direction, which made me extremely anxious. Honestly, after this, I doubt I’ll be coming back. And, at this point, I’m really sorry.

I'm a female electrician. I often go into a big chain hardware store for stuff I don't have time to wait for a wholesale delivery or just getting bits and bobs like toolboxes or paint for my house.

There's one guy who grinds my gears. Everytime he's working he speaks in the most disgustingly condescending manner. One night I was looking at toolboxes and he goes ""oh, didn't see you there. Obviously, you need help"" (this is a direct quote.). I politely say no thanks and his response was
 ""are you SURE you know what you need young lady?"" 
""Yes I'm fine thank you. I am actually an electrician haha"" to which he responded ""sure, I believe you"" and finally left me alone.

Last weekend I was getting paint and had a feeling of dread when I realised he was the only one there to mix paint. I decided maybe I'd been unfair and to give him a go. I explained I was getting new samples as though the previous sample I'd gotten looked grey in test Patch as soon as I painted the whole room it looked blue. Laughed it off as my mistake. 

He then proceeded to tell me a story about how he'd proved a woman customer wrong by sending a decorator and it must be the same - something was throwing the light, like a car reflecting. Whilst in the middle of responding, he literally cut me off mid sentence with a dismissive ""yeah yeah"" and continued to say how many customers he'd proved wrong.

501,MyNeighBertoltoro,0,t3_aqh3d5,274,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aqh3d5/waitress_called_over_her_coworker_to_point_and/," When I was around 8 years old, my mum took me to her coworkers wedding. During the reception I was quietly sitting around bored so mother nudged me and asked me if I'd like to get a soda from the bar. This was a Very Big Deal because we grew up very poor. Like, poor to the point I thought it was normal to eat cornflakes with water because milk was a treat for rich people. I was always really anxious about money being spent on me as a result, I'd always feel so guilty. My mother reassured me and told me not to worry because the drinks were free as part of the wedding. She told me I just needed to go up to the bar and ask for a drink and I would get one and I wouldn't need money. Mind you, the entire restaurant/bar was booked out for the wedding so it's not like I could have been mistaken as a separate diner who had to pay.

I walk alone up to the bar and see a young woman of around ~22 behind the counter who stares down at me with an annoyed look on her face. I was still really worried about the money issue since I'd never heard of free drinks before, so I shyly asked her, ""um... Is it true that the drinks are free?"". I'm a tiny kid and I'd never heard of catering.

The woman stops polishing her wine glass and lets out this loud snort. She then starts smirking. She stared at me silently with that smirk on her face for at least 5 seconds (which is actually really long IRL when it happens to you) and then without taking her eyes off me, she tilts her head and loudly calls out, ""Oi, Melissa!! Come over here!"" And then she starts cracking up laughing.

A second waitress wanders out of a room behind the counter, stands next to the first waitress and glances at us curiously. She asks whats up. The first waitress sticks her arm out and points her index finger right in my face and while still cackling, she tells Melissa, ""this little girl thinks the drinks are FREE"".

Melissa howls with laughter and they both stand like a metre in front of me, one still pointing straight at me, just straight up jeering and laughing uncontrollably. I'm beyond confused and I feel so tiny and humiliated. I thought it was an innocent question? Why are they both making such a big deal about this?

They continued laughing and clutching each other for so long that I started to turn away and walk out on the verge of tears. That makes them stop laughing as hard and Melissa yells out ""Oi!"". I turn back. Melissa says to me in an extremely condescending voice, ""they're not free, they're *on the house*"".

I've never heard of that phrase before and I'm still scared from their reactions so I just kinda froze. They sneer harder and go on to say that ""on the house"" means I won't have to pay so hurry up and tell them what drink I want.

And now my earliest memory of Fanta is sitting quietly at the table next to my mum drinking it and feeling so ashamed and tearful because I still didn't understand why I didn't have to pay if it wasn't free, but that it must be my fault for being stupid because grown ups wouldn't react so strongly unless they had a reason :( (obviously I know better now)

I know it's such a minor incident since it's not like it cost me any money, but their reactions were so over the top. I'm now older than they were at the time and I simply can't understand calling over your coworker to point at and mock a child who was too little to know the difference between ""free"", ""on the house"" and ""don't have to pay"".

I really didn’t want to cause any problems for the employees, so it was actually my mom that complained. The manager was incredibly kind and helpful Eventually we decided to send the steak back. It was still a great experience despite that as that meal was the first steak I had since before an abdominal surgery.

It's that time of year again, so I went to a local urgent care to get it done. The nurse at the front recognized me because this is the 7th year in a row I've had it done there. She greeted me, had me sign in, did the TB test, told me to come back in 72 hours, and sent me on my way.

I currently go to a local university, and I had class the following days (yesterday and today), so I made time this morning to go over and have it checked before my 9 am class; the website, Facebook, and even the DOOR of the business says they open at 8 am. I figured I'd pop in, they'd look at my arm, give me the negative test result, and I'd go to class on time.

I had no such luck.

My mom gave me a ride, and we arrived at 8:15 am. The doors were locked and the lights in the lobby were off, but there was a light on that I could see from the back room beyond the hallway from the window. I knocked. And knocked. And knocked again, but no one answered. I start to panic, because 1. the 72 hour deadline was up by 11 am and 2. I had to go to class.

My mom told me that I'd simply have to skip class because she sure as fuck wasn't paying to have me do it again. I emailed my professor and explained the situation (because it's a lab class, and more than two unexcused absences can result in you being dropped or failed; this wouldn't be unexcused technically once I get the green light from her, and if she needs proof, I have the TB test results, but still, it's not great to skip lab).

Finally, the doors open at 9 am on the dot. I go in and there's a guy at the front desk with a plate of mostly-eaten food; I have a suspicion this guy was in the back eating and ignoring my knocking, but I have no proof. I politely told him I had been waiting since 8:15 am, and he paused a moment, then said ""Oh, uh, I got here late because... rain. You know, hard to drive in this weather...""

It *was* raining, but... a whole *hour* late, and opening *right on the dot at 9?* Sounds legit. He then said ""Oh, we don't check TB tests until 9, didn't the nurse tell you?"" No, she did not, she just said come back within 72 hours, presumably during normal business hours. I'm 99% sure he was bullshitting me, but I tried to shrug it off at this point because I was already late and just wanted my test so I could get out of there.

I explained that I was there to get a TB test checked. He asked if I was with the local school district (employees there also have to get regular TB tests, and are given a hefty discount). I said no and explained I volunteer at a local zoo that mandates this. He asked for my name and started rifling through a pile of folders on the left side of the reception desk.

He disappeared to the back for a few minutes and then comes back to look for my file. After ten minutes, he still couldn't find my file. He finally looked at another pile to the right of the front desk and found it, but wait, it doesn't end there.

He explained the left pile was for people who worked at the school district. I repeated myself and explained that no, I do not work at the school district, I'm a volunteer at a zoo. He looked mildly surprised, as if I hadn't told him that. 

""So you're here for a TB test, right?""

I blinked and explained to him that no, I'm just here to get it checked. He looked surprised again and said ""Oh!"" He then asked for my date of birth, because apparently there's *two* people with my first and last name-- me and another lady. I gave him my DOB.

""So were you here for the 11th (Monday) or the 14th (today) to get the test checked?""

I was baffled. He repeated himself as I was trying to comprehend the comment. He was asking which day I got the test done. That doesn't make sense for four reasons: 1. I stated I was there to have it CHECKED, not done, meaning it'd make absolutely no sense to have done it that day and have it immediately checked, 2. Who gets a TB test before 8 am? 3. I had showed him my arm by this point. It was not puffy, but a vaguely pink dot on my arm at this point, almost completely gone indicating it'd been awhile. And 4. Aside from the unusual chances that I and a person with the same name would be getting a TB test in the same week, I already gave him my DOB, and I had no idea what he was confused about.

He also asked ""You came on *your own,* right?"" and asked, once more, if I work for the school district. I bit back my irritation and said no, I most certainly do not work for the school district. *I volunteer at a zoo.* I did not come in just to get a TB test for fun, but he was having trouble comprehending that apparently it's possible to need one of those tests for *other* jobs and situations. For a moment I briefly thought of /r/Idontworkherelady because he was having trouble understanding that I don't work there. I'm not even majoring in anything related to teaching, I'm a biology major about to graduate with a BSc.

After a few repeated answers, he finally gave me the negative test result and sent me on my way, but not before saying ""By the way, we open at 9 am, not 8 am."" 

... Except *the front door, the website, and the Facebook page all say they open at 8 am.* I rolled my eyes and left at this point because there was no winning with him.

tl;dr dude at the reception desk I *sincerely hope* isn't a nurse or a doctor had trouble understanding that 1. I don't work for the school district, 2. I'm here to get a TB test checked, and 3. I am not the other person with my name even after I gave him my date of birth.

I'm hoping my professor understands my absence from lab. If she requests it, at least I have proof that I had to fight for. EDIT: absence excused, no proof requested. Phew.

We grew up kind of poor so my dad could only afford the older game console but it was amazing for me and my brother. 
The day after opening it on Christmas we went to buy games for it at a game store. My dad did not think to buy a game for it because he knows very little about video games but knew we wanted the gamecube because we had been using our Nintendo 64 for years. So after me and my brother eagerly going through their tiny selection of gamecube games, we finally decide on one and we get in the atrociously long, day-after chirstmas-line to pay. My parents were getting annoyed for waiting so long. We'd been in the store maybe about an hour now.

The line then continues. We quickly grab another one and go back to the front of the line where the employee held our first game we were going to pay for. Surely we did not need to get back in line, as he held on to our game and we had already waited our time. INSTEAD, the same employee yells at me and my little brother to go to the back of the line. And as I try to explain we had already waited our turn once, he interrupts me and yells at us again. ""Back of the line you cannot come up here!"" Then my mother, who doesn't even speak English that well politely tries to explain that he had told us about a deal and to go get another free game. But he just screams in her face the same thing again while rolling his eyes. 
So we go back to the end of the line and I hear the employee tell the next customer, ""sorry about that, some of these people."" I felt so humiliated and so angry he yelled at my mom like that. Then we finally get to pay again and remembers it us and gives us our free game and pulled out the original game we were going to pay for. So he knew he had told us to go grab another game after waiting in line and still made us wait again. My parents were furious. And I have never shopped back there since. Its probably not a big deal or I might be in the wrong for wanting to not wait again in line. But I'm 22 now and I still think about it sometimes.

507,Alman54,0,t3_aqkitm,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aqkitm/i_like_to_tip_nontipped_employees_for_good/,"There is this regional gas station that also specializes in selling dipped ice cream cones and things.  More than twice when I've ordered a milk shake, I've tipped the person who made it a dollar.  One time, I overheard the employee say to another employee, ""He just tipped me a dollar!""

Sometimes when I order carry-out, I'll tip the person who took my order and got it all together a couple of dollars, especially when it was a several-item order that could easily get mixed up.  The last time I did this, the girl said ""Thank you!"" and was very happy with the unexpected tip.

Recently at one well-known fast food place, after I placed a larger than usual order, the young guy who took the order and brought it to me, as I waited in the lobby, was pleasant and thorough.  Inspired, I returned to the location later and told the manager how good of a job he did.  (I used to be him, way back in the late 1980s.)

But the most recent event that stands out was a trip to a chain that specializes in chicken fingers.  Earlier that day, I attended the funeral for my wife's grandmother, a very sweet lady who we will all miss.  I went to the restaurant for carryout for my family, I was starving and couldn't think straight (low blood sugar, I guess), and wasn't that familiar with the menu.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and patient, and helped me pick out what I needed and made suggestions.  The food came out quickly and everything was perfect.  Later I called the manager and told her what had happened, plus I called the 800 customer comment line, and even filled out a survey on the website.

Does anyone else do this?

These places get more complaints than they do compliments, so I feel the occasional compliment would be nice for them to receive, especially when it's for good customer service.",1,"I like to tip non-tipped employees for good service, and give compliments for good employees.

I was dining out with my mom and son (2). Now for some important background information it is very difficult to get my toddler to eat. Hes picky. BUT he loves hummus and bread which is why we chose a Greek restaurant. Hummus galore. Anyways so the waitress takes our orders, is super enamored with my kid, gives kid coloring book (she never asked she just set it down in front of him) and we wait. I didnt say anything which was probably on me but I figured why not see if he will color. Now my son has never been one to enjoy coloring. He just doesn't have the patience for it but worth a try since it's something to do while he waits for food. So he starts throwing crayons which I take away so as to not annoy any other customers. But the thing is that upsets him because he was loving throwing the crayons. Well food finally comes, I remove the angering crayons and color book and thus we start to eat. By this point everything Is fine. He is calm, eating, happy. But remember I said she was enamored by him? Well she had gone and gotten her also young co worker and they were literally just standing across the resturaunt staring at him and trying to get his attention while I was in the process of feeding him. My toddler gets VERY shy and almost upset if he has too much attention from someone he doesnt know. Well this completely disrupts his eating and he starts slapping at the utensils and just acting out and food is everywhere. Well they cracked up about this. I was so irritated. I glared at them and turned his highchair around so he couldn't see them. Well he was paranoid and wanted to keep checking if they were watching him (they were and laughing)which basically ended lunch for him cause at that point theres no way he'll eat. 
Like I know it may have been funny to watch but man... be professional
I wish I had a better ending to this story like I got their manager or something but no.. we just paid and left but I know for future reference I will say something because that day was so difficult afterwards because he didnt eat and was overwhelmed. But just wanted to share and say that you really shouldn't mess with someone else's baby/toddler when they're trying to eat. Cause you dont know what they go through.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and I were finishing up shopping a few nights ago and we decided to stop by a certain fast food chain known for a sassy Twitter page. We went through the drive thru and as we were pulling up to the speaker, one of the employees was sitting behind the large menu, smoking who knows what and mimicking the person over the speaker, saying things like “Good morning” though it was after 8pm. We were just like, Okay, whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we proceed to order, and the speaker was cutting out like they do and so there was some confusion. It turns out there was about 10$ extra added to our total, so when we got up to the window to pay and get our food, we asked the lady for our receipt to look it over. She hands us a receipt with only the credit card information printed on it and the overall total. As we were looking at it, clearly confused, the employee opens the window again and hands us the itemized receipt and then proceeds to say “I don’t usually do this but I saw you guys looking at your receipt confused.” This confused us more because what restaurant doesn’t give you an itemized receipt? So I look at it with my mom and we see it’s $25 and they added a few weird things to our order so I told my mom to park and I’ll just go inside to fix it. We were not in any kind of rush. 



I get inside and the employee at the window comes over and is like “What’s wrong, why did you come inside.” She says this with the beginnings of an attitude. (From here on out she is now E1 for Employee 1, the guy originally behind the menu outside is E2, and the manager is Manager.) I explain the order again, thinking E1 misheard our original order and she gets super huffy. Then E2 comes in from his smoke break and he is clearly high on what smelt like weed. His eyes are bloodshot and red and he is just laughing and weird stuff. E2 asks me if I wanted a refund and just to restart the order, so figuring that would be easiest I say yes. My mom is inside at this point, so he fixes the order and refunds us the $25 then charges us the right $16. 

&amp;#x200B;

E2 offers me a free small frosty at this time for the confusion and the wait, and so I said sure and he gave me one. Then, E2 goes back into the kitchen where E1 is now prepping the chicken nuggets my boyfriend wanted. E1 isn’t wearing gloves, her hair isn’t pulled back and her hat is barely on her head, so my mom and I were pretty grossed out. Then E2 yells really loudly “OH NO SHE DIDN’T” and E1 tells him to shut up. It’s very clear she either spit or contaminated our food in some way. This yell attracts the attention of the store manager, and when she goes over to check it out E2 whispers into her ear whatever E1 did with out food, and the manager laughs. E1 then finally put on gloves. My mom and I were watching this whole thing and my mom called the manager over and told her we just wanted a refund because we didn’t feel safe eating anything E1 or E2 prepped because she clearly did something. The manager starts mocking us and saying “OH DID YOU SEE SOMETHIN’? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU SAW?” Nearly yelling and saying it in such a way she was clearly disrespecting us. My mom just calmly said “I need a refund.” The manager finally gave it to us, we checked the sanitation rating- of course it was a 91.5- which grossed us out more and we finally left. The entire ordeal was about 30 minutes and we lost our appetite.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- Employee at a fast food chain messes up our order, we go inside to get it fixed and she contaminated our food. We got a refund but only after being mocked and disrespected by the manager.

My mother owns a little shop which sells cute stuff and presents. I also work there sometimes to help her. And because we are living in a very small town in Germany, she knows many people there. She made a friend (let's call her Sheila) who always came to our shop, sometimes just to chat, so when Sheila told us she owned a restaurant my mother wanted to surprise her by going there next week.

So, my mom and me were both working in her shop. Then in our break at work from 1pm to 2pm, lunch break, she wanted to go to Sheila's restaurant.

We both sat at the table as the waiter did not came at first. He was standing behind the corner and played something on his mobile phone. Then, as my mother had waited a few minutes and nobody but us was there, she waved him over. We both ordered noodles, and waited so long for them, that I had to go back to our store and had to put a sign on the door telling our customers that we were closed until 3pm (which you can do in a little town like ours).

The food came, and the waiter constantly stared at us. My mother could not see it, because she was sitting with her back to him. But I did. It was like he was staring at how we ate. Seriously, I felt really uncomfortable.

He came back to the table every five minutes to check, asking if we were ready although we clearly were not.

Then the unthinkable happened:
We were indeed ready, so my mother asked him if she could take the rest of the noodles home with her because our lunchbreak was over (it's common here).

And he looked at her before he answered: ""Oh, i think you've had enough of that.""

She stared at him. ""Excuse me? I would like to take it with me. If that is not possible, that is okay.""

And he just laughed and said: ""Look at yourself. Don't you think you have eaten enough already?""
My mother is not really thin, but she is also not fat or anything.

Then he took the food away from us and did not come back. We heared him laughing from the kitchen.



TLDR Waiter is playing something on his phone until we tell him to come to our table, then stares at us while we are eating, proceeds to ask if we are ready with our food and then tells my mother she should look at herself and that she has already eaten enough, takes the food away and laughes his ass of.",1,"""You've had enough of that"", said the waiter and took our food",46

I needed some basic ones and was also on the lookout for a pretty lingerie set to treat myself. I have never liked bra shopping. I’m not too big, but it’s not an easy task and I quickly get low self-esteem if things get a little difficult. 

I went to a store I hadn’t bought bras from before and picked a basic nude bra with straps. I had checked my bra size with the bra I was wearing, but for some reason the bra I was trying out felt really tight anyway. I told the lady working there and she gave me one size up and told me to just ask for help if I needed any. 

I try the bigger size and almost every part just sits wrong and it sits very loose. At this point, I just don’t know what the problem is. I leave the changing rooms and go looking for the lady I had been talking to. I don’t find her, but someone else asks me if everything fit alright. I try to explain that both sizes didn’t sit right and that I didn’t know what the problem was. She tries to ask if it’s the cup size that’s the problem and I tell her I honestly don’t know. She just laughs in my face and tells me that she can’t help me then and just takes the bra out of my hands. 

Like, you work in a bra store. Idk, measure me or something? Take a look at what is wrong? Just generally do your job instead of making me feel bad?

 Yesterday I was at the store that rhymes with 'baller fee' where everything costs $1. I hadn't been there in a while because I usually travel by bus and it's difficult for me to carry a lot of groceries home, but I was hanging out with my mom and she gave me a ride, so I was stocking up on things I needed, (mostly cleaning supplies and household stuff) . At checkout, there was only one register open and a line, but it was moving fairly quickly .  When the person ahead of me was checking out, the cashier told me  there was no divider so I allowed plenty of space between our items. When I was up, I pointed out to the cashier where my stuff ended- before the Valentines stuff that the next customer had-this woman had ONLY Valentines stuff and I had NO valentines stuff. (I didn't say this aloud, just explaining here). I again left some space between the orders. The cashier nodded and continued to ring up my items. Since she had already pointed out about the divider and I had pointed physically to the end of my stuff, I got to chatting with my mom thinking it all was good, but I noticed out of the corner of my eye that she swiped two sheets of heart stickers.  I was like 'oh no, those aren't mine, I don't have any valentine stuff!'. She looked annoyed, didn't say anything, but immediately got on the phone and called someone else to the front and he arrived fairly quickly. They pushed some buttons on the register and I assumed she was taking those last two items off of my bill (it happens /has happened to me at other stores and it has been an easy and quick process to get it removed )  - - but no--- a receipt printed out and she crumpled it up and said I have to re-ring the whole transaction, which she started to do immediately by pulling items out of bags and ringing them again! I was like whaaaat I could have just paid 2 bucks  extra instead of you having to  re do  my 50+ items, but she ignored me. There were several people behind me now , the woman who had the Valentines stuff was on the phone and didn't witness it, but she did look exasperated when she saw what was happening . It seemed to take forever the second time around because the cashier had to take stuff out of the bags and put them back on the belt, which I helped her with to speed things up . Thankfully the man who had come to the front opened up another register, but that was after just standing there watching her ring me up and when another customer coughed . When the cashier handed me the receipt, she said 'I need a divider.' really loudly into the air and that was it.

I looked online and ordered a sauté pan and a fondue pot. It came out to a dollar over the GC (including shipping)...I was thrilled. A few days later I received the fondue pot only. I looked online and, sure enough, it said both items had been delivered. UH OH. I called. I politely asked if both had been delivered, if there was a mistake, blah blah (I am always *super* polite on the phone with customer service). The woman looked everything up and said that they had actually separated the order, it was a mistake to show that both had been delivered, and my sauté pan would be arriving in 3-4 days. Ok, cool. I thanked her and hung up. Got the pan a few days later, and have since used and enjoyed both items. Fast forward to a month later. Yesterday, I receive an envelope from said company with a gift card for my “refund” for $20 and some odd cents. I was confused (did the shipping for sending two separate items actually make that much of a difference???), so I called: NL (nice customer service Lady), M (me)

M: I’m confused why I received this. I purchased blah and blah, kept and like them both

NL (after looking up number): HMMMM, looks like someone refunded you for your fondue pot.

M: oh, well what should we do? I didn’t return it

NL: well, the transaction is complete so you can just keep the money.

M: even though it was a mistake? I do appreciate that, but I really try to be as honest of a person as possible, and that would essentially mean I get one of my items for free,

NL (starts laughing): do you know how many “comps” I give out all day? $20 is nothing for the company, not to mention you are the first person I have ever had who called to try to give money BACK. Anything else I can help you with today?

M: ummm, no, and thank you so much

I know this doesn’t sound like a lot, but I’ve been “struggling” financially for the first time in my life. I have been selling a lot of my most beloved possessions just to pay bills.

I have a short story from my recent trip to the world of wally's that used to give out smiley stickers.

Backstory, I am a new mother to twin girls. My husband and I have WIC (Women Infant and Children) to help cover the cost of formula. The stuff our girls are on is over $20 per can (after tax). With twins, we run through a can of formula a day, so the wic is immensely helpful.

On to the story

I went to the store to get (10 cans of) formula, eggs, milk, cheese, all things covered by our WIC. I'm trying to check out, of course there is only 2 lanes open. I'm patiently waiting in a line that's about 7 customers deep. There is a worker walking around with a scanner, she can only take normal debit/credit cards, no wic cards, no cash. When she sees what's in my buggy, she asks me if it's on WIC, I say yes, and she says I cant ring you up, sorry. No big deal, the wic cards are tricky on their best days.

A few minutes later, I'm still in line and hear the same mobile cashier walk behind me and say, if you can't afford kids, just don't fucking have them.

I just kind of froze, like, did she really just say that. Thinking back now, I'm just thankful that my husband wasn't with me, because he wouldn't have handled it as well as I did.

My tale begins a few weeks ago, as I first noticed that my car ( a 15 year old small cabrio) was making weird squeeching noises. I got it checked and it was missing a lot of it's power steering fluid, so I got that refilled and regularly check it now because even if we (My grandpa who is a trained mechanic and I) could not find a leak there still may be one. This kind of fluid does normally not go empty, so we still don't really know what happened there. 

Anyways, fast forward to a few days ago. My car has been fine for the last weeks, no weird sound or anything, just the normal problems that arise with old cars and cold weather and since this car has been in my familys possession for about 5-7 years by now I (and if not I then definetly my parents) know which sounds are due to that. So, now that you are up to date with what is wrong with my car I can finally move on to the customer service part of this.

I was really craving some Kebab so I grabbed my car keys and drove to one of the two Pizza ""Stores"" (I don't know if such places are a thing in America or generally outside of Germany, but you can basically get Kebab, Pizza, fries and some turkish dishes there, there is no table service, you order at a counter and you can also get all of your stuff to go) in my village. 

Seeing as I often order from them (they do deliver also), and it's still a village I kind of know the delivery boy, not even by name but I once shared a long conversation with him as I ordered Pizza there and since then we always greet each other and stuff. So I pull into their driveway and my car starts making this screeching sound again. As soon as I hear these sounds I just sit in my car for a moment until a really loud swear word exits my mouth, I sigh and get out of the car. Pizza delivery boy stands a few meters away, in front of the entrance and just says ""Steering?""
I nod.
And then he proceeds being one of the most helpful human beings ever. 
He explained that he had the exact same problem with his car and that there is a specific cable that could be causing it, as that was the case for him, and I should get that checked in addition to the power steering reservoir.
Needless to say, the first time I got my car checked no one thought of this cable.
I now have an appointment with my grandpa so he can look at it again. 

Funny enough, I ordered Pizza from them yesterday and it was this delivery boy who brought it and he asked me about my car too. 

I just really wanted to rave about this as this car Problem has ben nagging on me for a while and I finally know what to do, without having to spend a ton of money I don't have!

TL;DR: My car is broken and our local Pizza delivery guy identified the problem just by hearing it and gave me the first really helpfull clue in repairing my car.

519,redemptionquest,0,t3_apzauq,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/apzauq/the_vegan_restaurant_that_thinks_their_shit_dont/,"So, I used to work in the restaurant industry while I was in college, and odds are I will again while looking for a better job. This was about a yeah and a half ago. And a girl I had dated in college had a few friends who were vegan, so when we all would go out to eat we (they) would choose painfully trendy vegan places.   


Now and then, I end up enjoying a vegan meal. I think it's honorable to do so, but the moral superiority some vegans have makes me a bit peeved. I get that it's going to cost a little bit more, but that should also come with friendliness, and better customer service, especially at a sit down restaurant. However, I've had better service at fast food places than we had at this LA vegan restaurant. The person who insisted on the restaurant actually got the worst service out of all of us, despite recommending the place and being a repeat customer. The place was packed, but we made reservations, and were given a small seat in the corner. They acted as though we should be honored to be there, which only makes sense when you see a front of house staff who truly feels honored to work there as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, first off, one important thing I learned from working in the restaurant industry is if you're working there, and a customer needs to cross your path, always let them go through unless there's an emergency. Especially if you cutting them off would prevent them from getting to their table. So, my date and her friend follow the hostess, and right as I try to get through, a bar server cuts me off, preventing me from getting to my table for two minutes, while I awkwardly stare  at the group. The server finishes, doesn't make any eye contact with me, or apologize, and simply goes. They almost acted as though I wasn't cool enough to be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately this kind of turned me off. I understand the place is packed, but that's all the more reason to let a customer through. So, eventually I get to my table, and the date is pissed, but trying to enjoy the time, and the friend is a bit mad. The friend quickly changes the subject to the food, which was actually amazing food. We talked about it (extremely paraphrased):

&amp;#x200B;

Me: That was pretty bad of them to cut me off.

Date: Oh come on Redemptionquest, they had a lot of stuff on that plate. 

Me: Yeah, but I've done that as well, and it's not that hard to move for five seconds so it doesn't take me two minutes to get to the table.

Friend: The food here is worth it though. Have you tried the cauliflower wings?

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that the appetizer wings platter is actually the same amount of the wings as the wings and salad, for about the same price. This happens, but I point it out to the other two. They're acting as though I'm trying to have a bad time to an extent, which I'm not, because who would try to have a bad time? I would love to go to a vegan restaurant, and tell my friend who makes big ass steaks that the cauliflower wings were great as hell, and the people there were cool as hell too. And I have before. Anyways, we order, I get up to use the bathroom, and while on the way back, I see our server, say hello, noticing they're carrying two trays, and they cut me right off, so I can't sit at the table, to hear about the dishes. He starts chatting up my date and her friend a bit as well, which I get, this is LA, people flirt for tips, but he just about lost mine. And theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

One server cutting you off is an anomaly, two doing it in less than an hour is bad business practices. We love the food however, but before we could even ask for them to box it up (especially their vegan mayo), they take the friend's plate away and don't ask us. Our friend asks for some vegan mayo, to go with the food we still have, and they say it'll cost extra. This just wrecked our trust in them. You can't claim sustainability and then go and try to pump out that extra $1.50 while wasting food. Bunch of dicks.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we get some vegan ice cream, called ""Kind Cream;"" well the friend does while me and my date don't feel like giving these asses any more money, but the ""ice cream barista"" who isn't doing anything acts as though we're inconveniencing her by asking to buy some. It was a bit ironic to think someone who pissy was selling the Kind Cream.

&amp;#x200B;

Date and I agreed we wouldn't be going back. I understand that you have to pay a premium for vegan food, and I've worked at restaurants where the food was expensive (seafood, etc.). But when you're selling pricey ingredients, you also have to go a bit above and beyond to make someone feel welcome, even if it's fast casual. And if you can't go above and beyond, at least the bare minimum is nice. I've had anxiety attacks while working, and still tried my best to be friendly to customers, and to ensure they feel like they're getting their money's worth however I can. Even if that means getting them an extra Diet Coke than they normally have, and asking if they'd like a lemon, it gives them a better feeling.  


I didn't feel this at the restaurant I was at, and odds are it's a management issue if the issues are the same with almost every employee.",1,"The vegan restaurant that thinks their shit don't stink, but it do.",26

521,Celistar99,0,t3_aplgqj,373,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aplgqj/liquor_store_employee_refuses_to_sell_to_me/,"So it's finally happened. As a retail manager, I'm usually on the other end of the spectrum, but the most bizarre thing happened to me this morning. The guy I'm seeing stayed over last night, and I went out to get breakfast sandwiches and orange juice this morning. There's a liquor store next to the convenience store, so I decided to get a bottle of Prosecco to make mimosas. Here's where it gets weird.


I've been in this store many times, it's the liquor store I mainly go to. I don't usually go in the morning though, so there was a lady working that I had never seen before. I went inside, said good morning, and picked up the bottle of Prosecco from the refrigerator. I set it in the counter and she was giving me a shifty look. She asked for my ID, which is fine. I'm 35, maybe look a bit younger, but I get that liquor store employees can't be too careful. I gave her my ID, and she studied it for a minute. Kind of weird, people usually just glance at the date and ring me out. She'll be C for cashier, I'll be me.


C (studying my ID) 'how old are you?'


Me: '35'


C: 'You look young.'


Me: 'Thanks.'


At this point, the cashier goes to a stack of papers and starts looking through them. I noticed that she hadn't actually rang anything up, and I started to get uncomfortable. I was just standing at the counter with my credit card in my hand. She came back to the counter and resumed looking between me and my ID. I was kind of worried that she would confiscate my ID or something. Finally, I cut to the chase.


Me: 'Do you not think it's me?'


C: 'It doesn't look like you.'


Me: 'I mean, I'm not wearing makeup now and the picture is about ten years old.' I proceed to tell her my full name, address, birthday, height, eye color, all the information on my license. The height alone should have convinced her, I'm almost 6' tall. 


C: 'I'm sorry.'


Me: 'So you're not going to sell to me?'


C: 'I'm sorry.'


At this point she gave me my license back and I said something like 'wow...Ok,' put my license and credit card away, and left.



Thinking about it now I'm not really mad at her, I understand that they'll get in a lot of trouble for selling alcohol to minors. But it was just so bizarre. I'm 35 and you saw my ID. This has never happened to me, even when I was 21. Just weird.


Update: I stopped back in today after work and got one of the regular guys. He rang me up with no problem and I told him what happened the other morning. Turns out, the lady was his wife and he was the owner. He seemed upset that I left empty handed, I told him I wasn't mad because I get it, I was just shocked. So at least he knows, and will hopefully mention it to her.

522,margarinetyrell,0,t3_apor72,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/apor72/got_called_buttfcker_in_a_drive_thru_line_by/,"This happened about six months ago (welllll before I had Reddit), so I had to settle for telling the tale in person. Now’s my chance to share it. Obligatory “I’m on mobile” disclaimer.

So, as a broke college student who hates her meal plan, I very often frequented a nearby fast food restaurant. It’s the kind that has two lanes, so I pull in to the less busy one only to hear what the lady in front of me is saying with my windows still rolled up.

“Does this sandwich come with MAYO on it?!” Asks the B*tchy Lady.

“I don’t think so, but I’ll make sure—“ the very nice and no doubt young woman working the drive thru responds before she gets cut off by BL. 
“WELL I WORK AT [name of the restaurant she’s currently ordering from] AND I KNOW IT DOESN’T COME WITH MAYO.”
“I’m sorry ma’am, it’s only my second day... Will that complete your order?”
“IF YOU HAD LISTENED TO ME EARLIER YOU’D KNOW I WAS STILL ORDERING!!!” Sheesh, right?

BL completes her order so I pull through. I almost think about apologizing for BL, but I decide to wait till I get to the window. I place my very plain, very small order and proceed through the line, pulling up behind BL. Now, these drive thrus aren’t particularly spacey and I have a HUGE front &amp; back end on my car, so I have to get kinda close (within 2 feet) of the car in front of me (BL) for the person behind me to order. So I’m sitting there, pondering over how god awful this lady is, when I see some heads turn to look at me from her backseat. Demon children, I suppose. And then I see the front driver side window roll down, and I know I’m in for some deep sh*t.

“COULD YOU GET A LITTLE CLOSER, BUTTF*CKER?” this lady with a “can I speak to the manager” haircut yells at me. I was so taken aback. WHAT? BUTTF*CKER? WHO THE F*CK SAYS THAT? And I’m not a big fan of confrontation, but I feel so bad for the drive thru girl that I realize this woman needs to be knocked down a peg.

“COULD YOU BE A LITTLE NICER TO DRIVE THRU WORKERS, B*TCH?” I yell back; I’m shaking. Again, not good with confrontation, nor have I ever really sworn at someone I don’t know. She gapes at me like she cannot believe I had the audacity to speak to her, let alone like that. She puts her head back in car and just stares me down from her rear view mirror. I hold her gaze and raise my eyebrows at her. Daring her to do something. You know how when you let off your brakes for a microsecond and your car sort of lurches forward without really going any farther? I did that, like, 10 times. She is not happy. I am absolutely joyful. I’ve worked shitty restaurant jobs; for once, I get to put a customer in her place.

Sidenote: I think we had a little more back and forth conversation but ‘twas long ago and I can’t remember it all. Just the iconic lines. 

So now she’s at the payment window, and I can see her hand the worker a gift card for the restaurant. I have my window up again so I couldn’t hear what was said, but I saw him hand the card back and I’ve never seen someone so angrily take back a gift card and shove a wad of cash back at the worker. It’s taking a while for BL to get her change back, which I’m guessing was done on purpose, and so she honks and is gesturing wildly at the worker. I roll my window down yet again and yell “HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE, MAYBE SET A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOUR KIDS FOR ONCE!” and she, again, looks at me like I physically shot her. BL gets her change and pulls forward. I pull forward and see a very emotional young girl at the window, standing to the side, while a male coworker works the register for her.

“I am so so so sorry for her, I don’t know who she is but no one should ever act like that. I’m so sorry,” I apologize, and they both just nod, like this isn’t the worst they’ve seen. The girl still looks like she’s crying and the guy is still trying to get my card to work, so I say one more thing:

“I don’t know if you heard what she called me, but uh.... she called me a buttfucker in the drive thru line.”

I can see their eyes go wide. “A...?”

“Yes. A buttfucker. What a world, right?”

And they just broke out into laughter. If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry kinda situation. They asked me which cars was hers and I gave them the description and they assured me she’d be taken care of. Now, whenever I go back there, the workers who were present for the Incident and I have a nice bond. ",1,Got called “buttf*cker” in a drive thru line by another customer.,154
523,TheLastLegionnaire,0,t3_apix1u,29,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/apix1u/shady_truck_inspection/,"This happened a couple years ago. I went to my usual vehicle inspection place to get my truck inspected, and there was a line almost out in the road. I couldn't get in line, because there was nowhere to get completely off the road, so I went to the only other inspection station nearby. This was a fast lube place I had been to several years ago. There was only one other vehicle there. That should have told me something. I went in and sat down in the waiting area, and there was an elderly woman in there waiting for them to finish her oil change. A woman came in from the garage and told her that because her car had over 70,000 miles, she needed the ""high mileage oil"" which would be an extra $30. The customer told her no. The employee said ""are you sure? We really recommend the high mileage oil."" The customer again said no and added ""maybe next time.""

So they bring the truck in for the inspection and it has been in there all of 2 minutes and the female employee pops in again. ""Sir, your windshield wipers need to be replaced. We can put the xx brand for $15, or the yy brand for $25."" I told her I wanted to see the wipers. ""Oh, well he (the mechanic) already took them off."" I still wanted to see them, so she took me out into the garage. The mechanic (I think he was also the woman's husband) picked up a pair of windshield wipers out of the trash and they were literally falling apart. There is NO WAY those were my windshield wipers.

It's important to point out, that at the time, our area was in the middle of a drought. It had not rained more than a few drops in a couple of months. So I guess these folks thought that I probably hadn't used my wipers in a while and would not notice if they showed me an old worn out set that they have probably used to pull this trick 50 times already. But the thing is, I had used the wipers on the way to town that morning when I washed my windshield. I would have noticed if they were coming apart, and they weren't. They were fine. Unfortunately, since the mechanic had already taken my wipers off and put them somewhere (probably to resell to someone else later), I had no way to prove that the wipers weren't mine. So I told them I would go to the auto parts store down the road and get a new set and put them on myself, and I'd bring the truck back for the inspection. ""Well, you'll have to pay for the inspection, and your vehicle will fail without windshield wipers. And when you bring it back, we'll have to charge you for another inspection."" These people have clearly done this before, probably many, many times. What I should have done was get in the truck and leave without paying them anything and get the inspection done at my usual place later, after I put some new wipers on. Instead, I told them to put the cheaper wipers on and finish the inspection. I felt like my vehicle was being held hostage.

After I got home, I looked up reviews on this particular place. Every single review online said pretty much the same thing had happened to them. There was always something extra that needed to be done to the vehicle. People who had just replaced their air filters were shown a filthy filter and told it needed to be replaced. People with brand new wipers were told they needed new ones. People getting oil changes were told they needed special ""high mileage oil."" The place is run by scam artists. I vowed never to bring a vehicle to this place again, no matter how long the line is at my usual place.",1,Shady Truck Inspection,377

Unbeknownst to us, it wasn’t a traditional restaurant. It was one where you go in and order upfront, get your own drink from a freestyle Coke machine (I hate those btw) and then sit &amp; get your order delivered. So I was immediately thrust into a position of having to order for me &amp; my three kids from a brand new menu. Husband &amp; his folks ordered for themselves of course. I thought I had gotten the job done, but when the orders came, mine was not delivered. I was already chapped at the low-service model w/full service prices, freestyle Coke machine (which I did not use) and the dirtyish table we had to sit at to seat all of us which took a good while to get attended to. My family was making a big deal about how unpleased I was &amp; that I’d “never let us come back”, but I wasn’t gonna make a scene about it to the staff because it wasn’t their fault the restaurant’s service model sucks &amp; I didn’t know what I was getting into.

We get there around 11 am on a Sunday and the host told us there was a 45 minute wait. She took my number and we went to the bar next door to have mimosas while we waited. 

About 50 minutes later I didn’t receive a call so I decided to stop over and check in. She said there was about another 15-20 minute wait. 

We finally get seated, and then order food. My friend loves to try more authentic foods when visiting new places so she and my other friend both ordered this Grits with Pot Roast and egg on top, with a side of potato chunks on the side dish. And for whatever reason they got an additional side of grits no one asked for. 

The food arrives and my friends both absolutely hated their dish. My friend said the grits were bland, and tasted like they were made with water, and just all around terrible. So neither of them ate more than a few bites. 

My friends in the group, including myself all felt bad that their dishes were in the $14 range and were essentially inedible. 

They didn’t want to complain, but we said what’s the harm in just saying something to the waiter. 

(Note he didn’t check in once asking how our meal was) 

Our one friend speaks up and tells the waiter that our friends did not like the dishes. 

His immediate response: “Why?”
Super passive, a little hostile. 

Kinda taken aback at his hostile response, my friend replied that they were just bad. 

Waiter: do you want another dish?

Friend: we already waited over an hour to be seated, and are running behind schedule so it’s fine. Don’t worry about it. 

Then the waiter seemed very annoyed at us and walked away. He comes back and says he can give them a 10% discount. 

We say that works, thank you, just wanting to leave. 

As my friend is checking out on this portable iPad he brought over, I notice her bill is for the Pot Roast Grits entree with a side of potatoes and they charged her for the extra side of grits that again no one asked for. 

While looking at her bill, it said -$0.10 discount as she was about to finish paying. 

So I ask the waiter, didn’t you say you’re offering a 10% discount? It’s only listed as 10 cents. 

He’s like well she paid, so it’s too late now 
And the proceeds to pull out his wallet with a stack of ones and starts THROWING dollar bills on the table and walks away. 

Were shocked.

We kept his tip money on the table And then got out of there as fast as we could. 

The waiter made us all extremely uncomfortable over a simple kitchen issue. We were polite and in no way wanted extra money, especially his personal money. 

That was probably the worst dining experience I’ve ever had. 

TLDR; friend unhappy with inedible food, mentioned it to waiter. He got defensive. Offered a 10% discount which ended up being only $0.10 cent discount, then proceeded to throw his personal tip money 💰 onto our table when we noticed the discount error.

529,MackenzieNoelle,0,t3_apem4w,18,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/apem4w/super_clueless_doctor/,"So a few years ago, a few months into my first year of college, I went to my local family practice because I was sick. I saw a doctor that wasn't my normal doctor because no other staff was available. 
I told him what my symptoms were and he told me that I had pleurisy.  Now, I knew what pleurisy was and it didn't match the symptoms that I was feeling, so I gently reminded him of my symptoms. He had me lay back on the table to feel around my abdomen. I told him that I was pretty sure my spleen was enlarged and that it had nothing to do with my lungs. Then he told me all about how poop moves through the body (which I guess was interesting but not particularly relevant). THEN he told me a story about a peanut butter sandwich (?)
And then, finally, I was the one that requested a blood test for mononucleosis. At this point I was feeling annoyed and  like I had diagnosed myself. Sure enough, the test came back positive.
I invited my mom to come into the exam room so I could tell her that I had mono. The doctor told me all about his personal experiences going through med school with mono, and how mono could be flared up by extra stress.  I expressed my concerns about this, since I was a new college student with anxiety and was under a lot of stress.
Then, I kid you not, this doctor told me (with a ""you silly girl"" tone of voice) ""You don't have anxiety.""
I told him ""Uhhh, yes I do. I get medication for it from this very facility.""
And he went on to tell me about how ""life is not that hard"" and used my mom as an example, saying, ""she's had kids, and look at her, she's fine."" I think he was trying to make me feel better by denying the existence of mental illness?? And he had never met me or my mom before?? My anxiety disorder and medications were in my files, right there on his computer??
I was honest just so baffled by the whole thing that me and my mom snuck out of the building while the doctor went to get something, I can't remember what.  I heard later that other people had complained about this doctor and he got moved to a different facility. 
Anyway, has this happened to anyone else? It honestly made me lose faith in doctors. What's the use of all that schooling if even after all of it you can end up like that guy?

Server was just okay from the start, doesn’t let us know the off menu specials, I have to ask about them after hearing another server tell the table across the way. Seemed like I was bothering him for asking. But whatever, I’m pretty easy going. 

I order the special, a $50 rib eye steak, medium rare, same way I order my steak every time.  Steak comes out, purple and slightly warm in the center. Definitely really rare and even too much for me. (I have eaten raw beef sushi in Japan, but not raw ribeye which is a little much)

Call the server over, let him know and he gives me an indifferent, “Okay, well what do you want to do?” I say sure a re-fire to heat it up is okay.

Steak comes back out, cooked fine to a medium rare, but is rather full of tendons and is tough. I eat what I can and leave a good half of it on the plate picked over.  Very obvious for the server. 

Server comes grabs the plate and intentionally avoids talking to me or asking about it. Asks my wife how her meal was but doesn’t acknowledge me and drops off the check. Meal for two was $131.77 and yes we were expecting an expensive meal with drinks. 

At this point, service was just mediocre, server made no effort to see if everything was okay or if there was anything else he could do, so I decide to leave $132 in cash and leave.  (This is the first time I have not tipped for a meal)

Server knew something was up, as he was hovering nearby and quickly went over to check. 

This is where it gets strange. He runs and flags me down near the stairs asking if he can get us a dessert or something. I say we are good and are just going to get going and he starts to talk about the tip and ends up saying I ruined his night and cost him money after he has to tip out.  I get a little annoyed and tell him, it’s not my problem and he can take half off the steak to leave a tip for himself. However he wants to work it out.

He keeps going on about ruining his pay tonight and I suggest we get the manager to finish the conversation with them around.  He can express his concerns to myself and the manager at the same time and we can figure something out. He says great and goes off into the back area. Comes out a few minutes later and says the manager isn’t available and won’t come out. I am pretty sure he is lying, and this really annoys me. I tell him I’m not playing his games and I ask a nearby server if they can grab the manager which they do. 

Manager comes out, a really nice lady. I explain about the meal, not leaving a tip, server flagging me down and complaining, saying that she the manager wasn’t available, etc.  She looked dumbfounded that he would flag me down, complain about the tip and claim she wasn’t available (she said he is always available for customers). I told her we were all good, I didn’t want anything and I just wanted to let her know he was trying to pull that stunt with me. 

She says that is 100% not okay, calls the server over and goes into the back to talk to him. She comes out super apologetic and embarrassed and hands me the $132 dollars back saying we didn’t have to pay for the meal.

Used some of that money to give our first babysitter, a super nice lady, a nice big tip. Very strange experience,  but was at least interesting to talk to my wife about later in the evening since it was so bizarre. 


TLDR: Went out to dinner with my wife at a fancy steakhouse while on vacation. Mediocre service, not good $50 steak, indifferent server. Left no tip, server called me out on our way out and lied about the manager not being available. Manager is available, is appalled and refunds the meal.

So around two years ago I switched to a strict vegetarian diet for health reasons.  I used to be an avid meat-eater, and most of my favorite restaurants and dishes were meat-heavy, so the adjustment was difficult for me. I deal with problems due to my diet pretty regularly, but this particular story still induces a small twinge of rage every time I'm reminded of it. 

There's a restaurant chain in Oklahoma that's pretty common, which has incredible baked potato soup. I used to go to this place just for the soup all the time, and one day, about 3 months after my dietary switch, my family and I went to (redacted) for a birthday dinner. I assumed I'd be able to get the soup, and just ask for no bacon bits. But when I ordered, my waiter informed me that they actually cook the soup with bacon in it, for flavor and whatnot. I was very disappointed, and even more so when I realized after a quick glance at the menu that there was approximately nothing for me to eat on the menu. Even the salads had meat in them, and I was informed that they were all pre-made. I ate a croissant that night. 

Flash forward to about 8 months from this incident. A friend of mine has just gotten a job working at (redacted), and I make the offhand comment about how much I miss this soup. After recounting my story, he tells me that I was misinformed, and that the soup (at least at his location, which is the same one from the original incident) only has bacon on top. I don't really believe him since he's so new, but I agree to go with him there for lunch just for a slice of key lime pie at a discounted rate. Several of his coworkers corroborate his testimony about the soup being bacon-free if requested. I am overjoyed at this news, and promptly order a bowl. 

After this miraculous news, I ate probably 5 more bowls of the soup on different occasions, always asking for no bacon, and always being told it was not a problem. I was in the prime of my life, ladies and gents, I could finally eat my favorite soup again. I wanted to go whenever I could. But around the 6th time I returned to this restaurant, I ordered my soup (with no bacon, thank you very much), and my waiter and I had the following exchange after I'd eaten about half of my soup.

Me: I'm sorry, I just saw some bacon bits in this soup and I asked for no bacon, can I get this fixed?

Waiter: Are you a vegetarian? You know the soup is made with bacon all up in it right? 

Me: What? Several waiters at this location have told me that it's only a garnish.

W: That's definitely not true. Whoever said that was mistaken. I'm an assistant manager and I can definitively say that we  make the soup with bacon bits, broth, and fat inside, and bacon bits on top. Maybe they were taking off the bits, but there was still bacon in the soup. 

I'm upset at this point, seeing as if this is true I've been eating something that isn't great for my health regularly for a couple months. 

Me: Okay then I'd like to return it and get something else. Do you have any vegetarian options?

W: You could try the chicken tortilla soup. 

M: Um...I don't eat chicken. 

Waiter: Oh. Huh. Yeah I guess we really don't have anything for you to eat do we? Maybe you just shouldn't come here anymore. 

It seemed incredibly rude to me that an assistant manager would tell me not to come back to his restaurant rather than try and accommodate me. Especially since there are people who can't eat bacon for religious or more serious health reasons, and who would have been unknowingly ingesting it due to this irresponsibility. It also seems weird to alienate an entire demographic of people. But I digress. At least I got a refund. 

TL;DR: I (vegetarian) ate a ton of bacon over the course of a few months after multiple servers told me there was none in the soup.

So this happened a few months ago and I decided to share it. I was at a local mall a few days after Christmas, so everything is on sale right? 
Well I’m in one of my favorite stores, shopping with my friend. It’s also midday and the kids are back in school so it’s mostly old women. There is a group of them at the counter doing the usual bullshit routine of “this was on the sale rack!” And “if you can’t do this you’re fucking stupid”.  To make things worse, the cashier is actually disabled and is clearly having a hard time. I wish I could say I stopped it but I am not the confrontational type. However, they didn’t bully their way to a discount and left in a cloud of angry grandma noises. Anyway my friend and I get up there, start ringing up and I notice a pair of pants I grabbed off a “sales rack” rang up doubled that. So I stop her and ask if she could take them off the purchase. When she asks me why I feel terrible telling her “because I thought they were on sale”. So I’m sitting her mumbling out apologies because damn she just had to deal with this. She asks me which shelf tang I point to the one with y’all the pants on it. She shrugs, writes it off, and gives me the sale price. She then tells me the store really doesn’t mind giving stuff at discount if it was placed in the wrong spot, but she only does it for nice customers. I “accidentally leave a ten dollar bill behind and leave in a great mood. I’ve worked in sales before and I know how hard it is to stay kind and positive. So it definitely pays off not to be a complete jerk when dealing with stuff that definitely isn’t the cashiers fault. ",1,The benefits of being patient,543

So after we smoked we go to our local crepe cafe because my friend loves them. Keep in mind we're stoned out of our minds. We walk in, stumble to our seats and our server greets us.

See, our server is a girl that graduated from the high school we currently go to and the moment we saw her we started harshly whispering to eachother , thinking she won't hear but she definitely did. And then my friend loudly says 

""You went to [high school] right?"" 

And she just looks at us and is like ""haha yeah I did, unfortunately"" 

But instead of answering we just stared at her for like a minute and finally ordered. 

After eating like maniacs and her coming to give us water but instead finding me going through my friends jacket like an idiot trying to find her phone BC it was making noise while she was in the bathroom, it was pretty alright. 

Then comes when I ask for the bill. Keep in mind I am trying so hard to come off as normal and polite because I know it's hard serving high people (better than drunk people tho) so I'm trying my best here. 

Me: hey hey hey can weeee get the bill 

Server: Uh yeah do you guys wanna chill or get the bill right now  
(I think she knew we were high, esp since she knows we go to a really druggie school)

Friend: bill please 

She asked if I wanted the machine but I was too busy searching for cash and she brought it and they just stared at me and I was like I'm so sorry. So she took the cash. I paid 13$ on a 12$ bill (that was all the cash I had and im surprised I was able to count that high) 

S: would you like your change back? 

I was about to say yes, but then I was like wait no it's only a dollar she should have it so LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT ASSWIT I SAID 

M: no haha keep the change 

F: omg dude 

God I sounded like such an asshole telling her she can keep a FUCKING doLLAR. and then I realized my mistake and show her my wallet and I fucking say 

M: I'm so sorry I don't have anymore cash to tip you 

AND SHE SAYS ITS OKAY AND LEAVES AND SHE WAS SO NICE AND IM CRYING RN BUT CREPE CAFE GIRL IM SO FUCKING SORRY I WISH I WASNT A DUMBASS PLEASE FORGIVE ME

I wear contacts, and since my vision is so bad, (astigmatism in both eyes AND very near sighted) they tend to be expensive. My eye dr charges a small fortune to order from him, but even if he didn’t, I wouldn’t, because his staff has always been rude to me and they’ve given me shit over my vision before.

I used to go through a blue box store since I worked there and could use my discount since the insurance I had at the time only paid for 6 months worth. (I was on my dad’s at the time as I just last year turned 26 and had to get my own), so it ended being a better price. Since I no longer work there, and my new vision insurance will only pay for glasses OR contacts, I now pay out of pocket for my contacts. (They’re much cheaper than my glasses, which I used my insurance for.)

Since I had gone to Blue Store for my glasses, and got stuck with an associate who didn’t like me from when I worked there and “forgot” how my insurance worked (she “remembered” after I made a passive comment about going to a competitor store that had a vision center), I didn’t really want to go there for my contacts in case she was there again and “forgot” I couldn’t use my insurance and caused ordering issues and headaches. I’d go there if I couldn’t find a better option.

I looked into another contact company that has a phone number for a name and delivers to your doorstep, and they offered a 15% discount for your first order, and with that, it ended up being cheaper than Blue Store, including the shipping. So I went ahead and put in my information and ordered the contacts. 

A few hours later, I get a call from them. They were just letting me know I had accidentally given them my glasses prescription instead of the contact one, and that it was no problem, I could just text them my contact one. They were super friendly and professional on the phone.

Since I couldn’t find my contact prescription, I asked if I could just send a picture of the box in instead. They said no, unfortunately, it needed to be an actual prescription. I told them no problem, I’d call my eye doctor the next day to get it. They texted me and told me not to worry about it, they would reach out to him for me, and let me know when they received it and processed my order. The next day, they let me know everything was successful, and I would see my contacts in about 5 business days.

Their behavior through all this alone was impressive, and them handling the eye dr for me (I seriously do not like that guy and will be leaving this year) really solidified my decision to continue to go through them. The contacts arrived much sooner, and a few days later, they sent me a personal (not typed out and stamped with a signature) thank you card from ordering from them. They also sent me an email thanking me again and offered me a credit to my account. 

They were so kind and polite through everything, and didn’t make me feel stupid or embarrassed for giving them the wrong prescription by mistake. They didn’t hassle me to sign up for the auto ship option, or to see their eye dr, or anything like that. They were just calm, cool, and professional.  I ended up doing their survey and rating them 5 stars on everything, and they are a company I will continue to order my contacts from. ",1,Some of the best service ever,31

538,paitenanner,0,t3_aox7ob,33,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aox7ob/confronted_at_a_car_wash_by_someone_in_a_company/,"First off, on mobile. Sorry for formatting.

As the title says, I was confronted at a car wash by someone who was in a company truck. A well known, national tire company (rhymes with schwes lab). 

I pulled up to the car wash, which has four bays total. Two manual, and two automatic side by side. The farthest automatic bay had a line, the second had one car, and farther back, away from the lines, by the manual bay, was parked the company truck. I figured since he’s parked farther back, he’s just getting stuff together or planning on using the manual one. So I go to the bay that only had one car in line and pull up behind them.

As soon as I put it in park to wait, I hear a car door slam, and a few seconds later, hear a hard knocking on my window. It’s the guy from the company truck. 

I roll down my window, (I really shouldn’t have) and he starts screaming at me. 
“HEY!! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS DOING?! YOU CUT ME OFF!!” And on and on. I’m a little shocked that he’s doing this, but tell him I thought he was waiting for the manual wash, since he wasn’t in the line. His face goes redder than normal, and he starts to go on another rant. Another person who was in line ended up confronting him and telling him to back off for me. 

I was shaken up by this guy just screaming at me over something so minor, that I ended up leaving the line and going to the store next door to try to calm down and compose myself. 

Guess who was parked next to me? Company truck. 

I snapped a picture of his plate number and called the branch that was in the city this happened in. This guy wasn’t their employee, but they offered to look into it more. I gave them the plate number in case that helped, and left my number to be called back. I also sent a private message to the company with the picture I took and told them what happened. I’m still waiting to hear back, but I hope they remedy this. That guy seemed pretty comfortable confronting strangers, especially over minor things, and didn’t seem at all concerned he would be in trouble. It makes me wonder if he has a history of this. I’m debating mentioning that to the company when they call back.

Tl;dr: a man in a company truck confronted me for “cutting him off” at a car wash when he wasn’t even in line. I got his plate number and reported him. 

UPDATE: The company replied to my message today. They agreed it was absolutely unacceptable and are looking into it more. I let them know I was concerned that the guy might have a history with stuff like this, given how he reacted and that it took a second person to get him to leave me alone. They left me on read.

539,IrkedCupcake,0,t3_aotllb,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aotllb/being_patient_pays/,"Backstory: So I’ve been dealing with some vision problems and desperately needed to have a quick eye exam to see if a new prescription would help my headaches. I had some health complications so I’ve had about 5 eye exams in the past 5 months. My usual eye doctor has me down for an appt in a couple of weeks. I last saw him in Dec and we were to see improvement and hopefully the following late Feb appt will be my last final checkup and permanent prescription. I am in the process of moving out of state so I’ve been in another state for about a months and even though my follow up with my normal eye doctor is soon I really couldn’t deal with the headaches since my last script has become too strong for me.

So yesterday I had an appointment at a local vision center and walking in I could tell they were having a extremely busy day. Their lines were ringing nonstop. I waited patiently while they handled calls and they were pretty quick in my opinion to check me in and then to call me up. Did all the normal stuff you do at an eye checkup, talked about what my issues were, got set up with a pair of lenses to use meanwhile to see if they will relieve my eyes and help with headaches. So I got sent back out and waited again. There was a line and all the chairs but one were full in the waiting room. They were still having tons of calls and some guy sat down next to me and was ranting to the people in the waiting room about how he didn’t want to wait long. I got called up to be able to check out, honestly I probably could have slipped out without paying but I’m not that type of person. The associate was helping me checkout when the associate manning the front desk came over to ask if she could have help handling calls. There was a line building again and the calls were still crazy. She agreed the calls were excessive and said it would be okay to start letting calls go to answering machine in the back. So then the guy who’d been ranting got called up and started freaking out cursing at the tech, and cursing at the two ladies up front because he had to wait so long (he hadn’t even waited 15 minutes probably). He eventually got calmed down and taken back and the lady helping me apologized for what happened. I told her not to worry since I myself worked customer service and know just how nasty people can be when it comes to unrealistic expectations and she told me that usually they have more staff but 2 employees couldn’t show up due to having the flu. She continued with the transaction putting my info in and then what was originally going to be about $130 turned into $30! She said she appreciated my patience and that it was a discount they could give at their discretion for certain situations. I felt so happy because me and my Bf are  trying to watch funds since I’m not working atm and having a baby on a single income means save and budget.

Today I visited a popular makeup store that also has a salon in the back. They were doing free makeovers and free updos. My roommate Emily had gone the day prior and dropped about $230 on her hair so they let her know and we all (me, roommate Emily, her friend T, My other roommate Eleanor) went. Our friend and my roommate Emily go get their makeup done while my roommate Eleanor and I get the updo done. I had wanted to try out the salon before booking an appointment, as I dropped around $400-$450 on my hair (total, after multiple appointments) at my old hairdresser and since I felt the price was pretty steep I wanted to look around for a new hairdresser. While they’re doing Eleanor’s hair, this conversation ensues between the two hairdressers. 

Manager (To Hairdresser): Hey maybe when you’re all set, you can do her updo? (Gesturing to me) 

Hairdresser: That's fine as long as I’m making my money too. I can't go to the electricity company and say 'I ain't got no money but I can offer you a free braid' “ I can’t pay in free braids. 

Manager: laughs along

Hairdresser: We’re here because we like it but it’s also about making that money and hustling. 

They continue to talk about making money, business, etc. I tune out because I’m uncomfy. Until I hear them talking about my roommate Emily. 

Manager: Yeah, the girl I did yesterday, her hair took HOURS. Ended up being over $200, but it took so long. 

Hairdresser: if you divided that up, you’d probably be making around 50 cents an hour. You wouldn’t even be making that much. Honestly it wasn’t even minimum wage if you think about it. 

Manager: agrees and they continue talking business

This was just so offputting and tacky because they just kept talking about money and making money and that kind of stuff. I was thankful to not get the rude hairdresser. I’m not trying to sound like I’m made of money because I’m definitely not, but I’m willing to pay a good bit to have my hair done often and done well, and they lost out on a potentially really good customer because they were mad they had to do a free updo that THEY were offering. My updo took less than 15 minutes. I just don’t get why you’d offer it if you don’t want to do it...

Then when I got my makeup done the makeup artist was hella rude, but it was like live Mean Makeup Artist ASMR honestly so I wasn’t mad about it because it was hilarious. She poked me in the eye, told me I need to stop picking my zits because my skin looked awful, and asked “so do you get your brows done? Like ever? You’re just so...fuzzy” but again, I liked the ASMR vibes so I wasn’t too mad.

It was a very small chip, and wasn't bothering him, so no rush. Now, some back story: he has sensory processing issues, and can get very anxious in situations where things don't go as planned. However, he doesn't (or now, probably, ""didn't"") have issues with going to the dentist.

My wife takes him to the appointment, and I get a text that it turns out he has a cavity, oh, and also the dentist is a jerk. Huh? Apparently the dentist is yelling at both her and my son. Naturally my son starts freaking out and having a complete meltdown - well beyond what is typical for a 7 year old. Here's a selection of the things the dentist said:

* After my son starts having a meltdown: ""I'm not doing this under duress, your kid is a disaster.""
* After my wife explained that's how our son is, could they give him something to calm him down: ""Then you can take him to the hospital and pay 5K to knock him out, because I don't want you calling me on Sunday.""
* After my wife said she's not comfortable with how he's talking to them, and suggesting they should leave: ""Maybe you should because I'm trying to be honest about how painful this will get for him and I'm going to be the bad guy.""
* While my son was (eventually) getting the cavity filled: ""Every time you make noise it takes longer, so you need to stop and be quiet.""

Apparently, at one point before the procedure started, the hygienists (multiple) suggested that he go sit in his office for a few while they talked to my wife. Because the dentist needed a timeout to cool down, so that he could be a functional human being with his patients.

My wife was really shaken up, and while my son seems fine now, I'm crossing my fingers that he's fine the next time he has to go to the dentist (not this guy, of course). Later on, she is texting about this with a colleague, who gives us a recommendation for another dentist. When this person finds out where we were going, she says she had a similar bad experience with this guy, and we find out that there's a rumor that parents are asked to sit in the downstairs waiting room (all the magic happens upstairs) so that they don't hear this guy yelling at kids.

Needless to say, we're gathering his dental records and will be going elsewhere.

I recently left my therapist of almost two years, mostly because she would mix me up with other patients and wouldn't communicate with me very well, but also because of a complex issue i will call CI.

Basically we went to her because i have CI and needed confirmation by a professional that i had CI and it wasn't just other psychological issues, and i also had just left my dad's house where my emotionally abusive stepmom lived. It was my dad's house yes, but my stepmom was the issue. The stepmom. My dad was negligent at times, very often, but living with him was fine. My stepmom was the one who told me i looked gross and that I was a financial burden, or that my mom was an evil slut, or told me there's no way i could be gay, gay doesn't exist, it's a choice, yadda yadda guilt tripling bullshit.

Anyway we visit this therapist, first session goes great, I talk to her about CI and she says she's working to specialize in it. We mostly talk about CI for the first few months, occasionally talking about my dad's house, and she's definitely trying to work from an angle of ""your dad was absent so you developed CI"" luckily i was able to convince her that no, that's not how that works. A few months later we start talking more and she brings up meditation. She wants me to try it. My mom used to listen to guided meditations all the time, and when i was younger my mom would make me listen to one if i was being unruly to try and calm me down. Didn't work, i hate guided meditations now.(didn't tell her that cuz I hadn't made that connection yet) My therapist is very pushy about it. Smug and self-assured in her rightness. She keeps trying to pressure me into it until finally she tells my mom to do one for me. 
So my mom has me lay down and reads out a guided meditation for me, it works in relaxing me, which also scares and unnerves the fuck out of me. As soon as she leaves I'm emotionally drained and bawling. It felt like she'd dug in my head with a probe and played my like a damn puppet. Couldn't talk to my mom for the rest of the night. Later on i told her what happened and we never tried again.

Recently told my therapist that i tried doing ""crystal healing"" meditations that my boyfriend had shown me. It was good for me. My therapist's reaction to this news was not. She was ecstatic, patting herself on the back and basically going ""SEE! I WAS RIGHT!:D :D"" i rejected her enthusiasm and went silent, the rest of the session consisted of her bugging me and trying to get me to talk in a very playful manner.
Back on the topic of CI, (I'll have to clarify that CI concerns something about women) whenever we talked about women it felt like she was trying to shove ideologies down my throat. Like she'd ask ""so if men are strong....... Then women are.....?*smug skeptic look*"" or ""if women are emotional, then are men sociopaths? You know it's ok to be emotional, you don-(cue long ramble that was very generalized and unnecessary where i couldn't get a word in edgewise to explain that no, that's not what i meant)""

She also suggested that CI was caused by my stepmom's pressure on me, to be a certain way, and that maybe i just completely backflipped on myself and developed CI because of that. It was easily explained by the fact that I'm gay. But I couldn't tell her that because she was going on a long teary eyed tyrade about how maybe i just needed to let go of the past and not let what she did to me affect me in the present. Of course she said this all with short pauses where i thought i would be able to comment, but then she would continue talking.&gt;:/ 

But the most recent issue was that we where reading over a book about CI and she brought up ""the trauma caused by my Dad, and *sniff, teary eyed pause* what he did *voice crack* to you""

What?

She also asked me about my uncle and said something about how I'd said he was (can't remember but it definitely wasn't my uncle she was thinking of) this has recently become an issue, 

but the overarching issue I've experienced with her is how she never matches moods with me, never lets me get a word in edgewise, and is usually smug or tells me very basic thing that i already know as if they're life changing pieces of advice and then says ""ok... I just wanted you to know"" in a very soft maternal voice.

Now you're probably wondering, ""if you had problems with her for a while now, why didn't you just leave sooner?"" Well, to get treatment for CI i needed a letter of diagnosis for CI, and my mom was informed i needed two years of therapy to get one. But we recently joined a program that'll get me discounted treatment and they said i just need three visits with their in-house therapists to get a letter.

When I was a freshmen in high school I suffered from really high anxiety. Whenever there was a test or project I would tend to freak out. 
 
One weekend before a test or something I had to go to my normal checkup doctor. Since I had a test coming up my anxiety was starting to eat me alive and with my luck the doctor was super busy.  (which isn't their fault, I get it) so I had to wait about like an hour, which made me frustrated. This frustration mixed with my anxiety and I began to have a full blown panic attack. I started hyperventilating and I felt like the walls were closing in on me. 

My mom noticed and went to go talk to the doctor. I couldn't take it anymore and ran outside to get away from the uncomfortable area. I started to calm down until my mom called me in and said they were finally taking me in. I followed my mom to the exam room and they sat me down, starting the check up. 

The Nurse that started the check up was super sweet. She gave me tissues to wipe away my tears and kept telling me I would do fine with my school work. Basically reassuring me that, I will be fine. This made me start to feel better, but then my doctor came in, who looked pissed as hell.  She started to exam me and as she did so, she began telling me how life only gets worse. (Which I know is the truth) She was telling me there was no reason for me to be crying because life only gets harder. Basically saying I shouldn't feel anxiety because in her eyes my life isn't hard. 

This just sent me right back into the panic attack and made me even more scared. I started to freak out more, crying a lot harder. This made the doctor even more angry with her not even looking at my face and rushing my check up with hardly talking.  What did she expect when she said those things? That I would instantly feel happy that my life is going to get worse? That the struggles I were going through were only gonna get harder? At that time I barely felt like I could survive high school and her telling me that made me feel like I wouldn't be able to survive in the future. 

Anyone should know when someone is having an anxiety attack, you don't tell them how life is gonna get harder. In that moment when I heard her say my future is gonna be so much worse, I didn't want to get to my future. I wanted to freeze life and stop everything. I didn't want to try to survive. 

After the appointment I got into the car and told my mom I was never going back. The doctor damaged my mental health too much that day and luckily my mom agreed. Supposedly my mom even saw her putting used needles back into the cabinet to use again, so she was already planning on find me a new doctor. This was the worse doctors experience I ever had.

(Long story short: I was having an anxiety attack and my doctor didn't care and told me that life gets a lot harder. Which (obviously) sent into a bigger panic attack and made me feel like didn't  want to live anymore. I told my mom I didn't want to go back and turns out she saw the doctor reusing needles. So she wasn't planning to go back after that visit.)",1,My Doctor didn't care I was having an Anxiety Attack.,39

Anyway, I was waiting for my mom and grandma to show up to Wally world, which has the popular Canadian coffee chain right next to the door. I tell my mom I’ll be there, so I head up to the counter to get my usual, a medium hot chocolate with an espresso shot. Lady tells me, no espresso. Okay, not super surprising for a small, store-front version of the chain. I tell her I’ll get a double double, with chocolate syrup. Close enough.

So, I sit where I can see the doors and start reading, scrolling through reddit, whatever, and I take a sip. It’s just hot chocolate. Well, shit. I have terrible anxiety and the thought of interacting with people I don’t know in any way that could be remotely negative, is terrifying. That said, I noticed there was no line, and that neither worker was busy, so I built up my courage and went for it.

I get up to the counter and say, “Excuse me, it’s probably my fault for confusing you with my first order, but you gave me a hot chocolate instead of coffee.” The lady, maybe under 30, looks a little confused but takes it, and opens it. She turns to the man working, maybe under 60, and says something in the language they both know. Then, she smells my drink, and starts pouring it out and says to the man, “Look! It’s hot chocolate!” *continues pouring* “No look, we gave her hot chocolate!” As I’m standing there awkwardly waiting, hoping this will go as fast as possible. The older man was a little grumbly, but not rude, and he hands me a new drink for which I thank him. I sat for just another few minutes, then my family showed up.

Obviously, I gather my things and go on my way through the store to get some things for my grandma, and finally my drink has cooled enough for me to taste it. I shit you not, it was fucking hot chocolate. I turned to my mom, to whom I had triumphantly boasted my confidence regarding the coffee situation, and said, “Dude. This is... also hot chocolate.” And she stopped and looked at me and asked if I wanted to do anything about it? I just decided to chalk it up to a 2$ loss and a laugh for the day. A little disappointed I didn’t get my caffeine, and what the hell to the guy who saw the lady pour out the hot chocolate to just give me a SECOND hot chocolate, but oh well. Hope I gave someone a laugh with my story.",1,"Well, at least you tried.",22

Bloody cute af) and had a black rabbit called Hades when I was 9 years old. He was gorgeous and I loved him dearly. Sadly, one day my mum came up to me and said she accidentally left the gate open when Hades was running around outside and he ran away. I was so distraught and it was a genuine mistake on my mother's part so I was never overly mad at her. It took me a while to get over it but my parents agreed to buy me a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

So off we went to the petshop and, when picking out a rabbit, I told my story of woe to the petshop employee. What she said to my 9 year old self I still remember to this day.

""Really? You lost a black rabbit? That's weird. There is a group of wild rabbits that lives in the woods by where I live and I always see them when I leave for work. Recently, a black rabbit has joined them and they all seem very happy.""

My eyes lit up! I knew it was Hades and he was okay! He was living a happy wild life out there! I rested easy after that and brought home my new rabbit.

546,TestPostPleaseIgnore,0,t3_aofnqo,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aofnqo/stopped_tire_change_halfway_through_then_forced/,"TL;DR at bottom, Obligatory on mobile disclaimer. This happened a few months ago around the start of the winter season when everyone is getting their winter tires on and changeover appointments need to be made a couple weeks ahead of time.

I had purchased a set of good winter tires and rims online from the member only warehouse, which I didn't have a membership to, however you don't need a membership for some of their online purchases, tire and rims being among those. Automaticly included in the online purchase is the price for the installation of the tires, which the website said would be refunded for non members when you pick up your tires from the warehouse. I was also emailed a 70$ rebate useable at the warehouse, for purchasing a full tire set.

Some days after placing the order someone from the local warehouse calls me to set up a tire change appointment. Conversation goes something along the lines of ""I thought that was for members only, are you sure?"" ""Yep, it's all already paid for just bring the rims (which are shipped to my house but the tires to the warehouse for some reason) and your car, and we can get you in a couple weeks"" ""ok sounds good see you then""

The tire change day come around and I'm thankful because even though I don't need the tires on yet for insurance purposes, I should really have them on as it had already started snowing the past week and road conditions weren't great. I drop off my car, sign in with the tire change employees, give them my keys, have a pleasant chat and watch the mechanic bring my car in, I figure now is a great time to spend the rebate as I can only use it here and I'm waiting for my car anyways. So I make my way over to the warehouse service desk to get a daypass so I can spend the rebate.

My turn comes and I ask for a daypass so I can spend my rebate, they ask to see it, so I show them the email I got with the gift card. The service lady had never seen one before so she calls her supervisor over. Supervisor is somehow shocked and appalled that I got this and tells me ""You can't spend that, it's for members only, how did you even get that!?"" so I explained that I had bought a set of tires online. ""So you're getting your tires changed here!?"" ""yes, I don't see why I can't get a day pass though?"" The super rushes off to the tire shop area, I follow her because she clearly want to duck my day up at this point. She's going off saying what is essentially ""Stop the press! This man isn't a member!!!"" I'm pissed at this point my car is literally in the air ready to get the tires changed, I think the wheels and rims were prepped at that point, but they take my car down and the mechanic hands me back my keys and says sorry, I say it's not his fault. At that point I've asked to speak with the store manager and called my girlfriend explaining the situation, something like half an hour had passed.

I get into the managers office and am told they can't change my tires because I'm not a member, I tell them I had specifically asked about that and was told I could, this was ridiculous. Supervisor pipes in ""No, you wouldn't have been told that!"" I say calling me a liar isnt helping this situation and clearly I had been as they were halfway through changing my tires when you stopped them. I talk to the manager more am told that I can spend the rebate and they will change my tires but they're going to void their liability warranty, I'm pretty upset and agree because I really don't want to rebook an appointmet for weeks from now or deal with this anymore, so they pen that the warehouse warranty is void and I initial saying ""Whatever, the manufacturer warranty should be plenty"" supervisor pipes in agian ""No that's void too"" and didn't even bother to respond to that. 

give them my keys, do my shopping and pick up my car, only an hour delayed. I called corporate a few days later and explain what happened, and he was appalled and said he'd handle it. I was mailed a signed applogy, a 300$ gift card, and another letter saying there would be retraining in dealing with rebates and customer interactions. 

TL;DR: Overzealous supervisor wastes an hour of my time, mechanics time and everyone's time, corporate agrees and gets me an apology and a 300$ gift card.",1,Stopped tire change halfway through then forced to waive warranty if I want my car back with winter tires.,191
547,Igavethemouseacookie,0,t3_aojrgk,6,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aojrgk/almost_bought_complimentary_ice_for_the_price_of/,"I frequent a large grocery store chain and regularly buy live mussels, sold for $3.98/pound in net bags, some crushed ice is usually placed over the mussels in plastic bags after they are weighed. I was buying about 4 lbs today (2 bags) and distracted by my child asking a question and when I looked up I noticed mussels in netted bags and ice were in two plastic bags but I didn’t notice if they had been weighed yet. 

The employee then placed the bags with the mussels and ice on the scale and weighed them. I said to the employee “are you weighing them with the ice?” And he responded “yeah ice doesn’t weigh that much.” I’m bad at being direct and confronting people  so I said, “they don’t normally weigh [and charge for] my ice.” He then must have realized he made a mistake because he said “yeah I weighed it like that because I had already put the ice in there [accidentally and didn’t want to take it out and put it back in.]” As a side note, the seafood counter was not busy at this point. So he took the ice out and reweighed the mussels in netted bags and plastic bags. 

The price difference was a total of about $6 dollars cheaper without paying for the ice. 

I feel slightly concerned that this employee will continue doing this to people who might not notice or be paying attention and because he might not understand the importance or use of tares with grocery store scales. My question is, would you bring up the issue with a manager to prevent future customers from being ripped off (not sure if my complaint would even have that effect and I’m not looking for the employee to be fired or written up) or drop it since he fixed his mistake?

I’ve also worked call center and front desk, and I try to not be “that customer”, but this one time, I’ve always wondered if the guy had some story of his version of call, with me as some shrill beast. So here’s the tale, maybe you can help me understand.

I had a small order delivered from a vendor I spent north of $10,000 a year at, but this order was around $50 for 2-3 items. I open the box, inspect the goods, and put it all away.

Then I check the receipt, and it says like $29, neat! I assumed there was some variation in sourcing the supplies, so they charged me less, right? Naw. My bank says the original $50. Well shit. I have to call in.

I explain to the phone agent that I need them to either refund this difference or print or email me a new receipt for my records, and I was pretty chill about it, I said whatever they need to do, I understand.

Guy tells me, “your receipt is wrong. The price is $50 on the website.”

I said “yeah, I see that, I know,” and I repeat what I need. I tried to explain (because hey, not everybody has to keep receipts for expenses) that I can’t reconcile the charge in my bank account to the receipt. I can’t reimburse $29 if I spent $50, I’d lose money.

He tells me to just use the price on the website. I sigh and try to explain it differently.

He tells me “Ok! Is there anything else I can help you with today?”

...I’m trying to be peaceful here. Maybe he got it. I ask how we’re handling the receipt issue. He tells me again the receipt is wrong, and to just use the price on the web page.

I finally stumbled through asking him to get me a manager or their billing department or something, and got a lady who said she understood completely.

She said she was sending me a corrected receipt, and I thanked her with no small amount of relief. She also said she was actually refunding the entire purchase price for my trouble. “WOW.” I said, and thanked her again. Omg right?

The next morning I ordered 3 drinks through the promo page because my parents came over.

 Just to clarify the promotion is each drink comes with one of these envelopes and there's no limit on how many envelopes you can get, the promo runs for a full month and started a day before I ordered.

So my order comes around and I didn't pay attention to the envelopes as my parents were here. So my phone was charging until they left and it updated the app at that time. I look into the bag and notice that I only had 2 envelopes and 1 wasn't even sealed.

I go onto the app and noticed that they aren't advertising the promo anymore even though it's supposed to go on until next month. I didn't take any screenshot of the promo at the time because I thought it would still be there. I contacted support about it and waited for their response.

5 different people kept asking me if there was a problem or anything missing about the drinks themselves and I said no just the promo item was missing and 1 was probably tampered with (I showed pics)

Fast forward to now and they said they checked their stocks or what ever and they seemed to be out of stock at the moment. So I assume they acknowledge that my order was part of the promotion here. 

I asked what they can do anything else for me about it and they said they send me another message once they figured out what they can do. And now they're saying I wasn't in a select group selected for the promo and they wouldn't do anything about it.

What the hell this promo is for the whole province. And suddenly they deny the fact that I was eligible for this promotional offer. Like how can you deny the fact that the order was made through the damn promo offer on their own app and they delivered part of the promo.

551,007beer,0,t3_aoaq99,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aoaq99/cell_phone_provider_tried_to_f_me/,"This happened about 2 years ago. My GF wanted to buy me a new phone for my birthday and after much searching I settled on a Motorola Z Force Droid. The cell provider had a special on it for 50% so my GF wanted to buy the phone outright for me, but that's not how it works.

That phone in particular had a cool projector mod for it too, and I wanted to get that as an addition. Turns out, the cost of the projector add-on is as much as the phone itself (bout $350), so I said nevermind.

The sales guy ringing me up is this frat-boy type, kinda douchey. He explained in order for me to get the phone at 50%, they spread out the payment for it over 2 years (Total cost of phone / 2 \* 24). So there is no way for me to just out-right purchase the phone. My GF can still give the $350 but it will be credit applied towards my monthly payments. In addition, the credits won't kick in until month 2 or 3. He also said the bill might seem high in the beginning but it will level out after month 3. It was all quite confusing trying to wrap my head around it, but the service rep was getting annoyed I had to ask him to explain multiple times and his voice kept raising as he repeated himself. Like OK dude, explaining the same thing louder doesn't help me understand it any better!

So month one, I get my bill, it's pretty high. Same for the second and third. I'm expecting a near 0'd out bill for month 4 - 6 with the $350 credit on account...but nope, it's still the same. So what gives?

I look at the printed receipt and don't see any additional charges on it. The cell company has an app where I can also look at the contract and itemized report of what I had ordered that day. Lo and behold, I see a charge for that overpriced projector for $350. Turns out the guy charged it even though I said I didn't want it. He either forgot to void it or deliberately left it there to steal from me.

I went in person to the store to talk to them, and the dude who helped me was there! I explained the charge of the projector that I never bought, and he was questioning me if I actually bought it. I told him ""remember it was as much as the phone so I didn't want it anymore."" He disappears into the back, after 5 minutes come back out and says everything is taken care of and our support will contact you. I was like ""wait what? someone will just call me?"" and he's like ""yeah yeah don't worry about it.""

A week passes by and nobody calls, so I went to their regular support line (mistake, should've just gone straight to the store manager, the fucker did nothing and was trying to get rid of me).

Dealing with phone support was a nightmare. I would explain my issue then they'd ""route me"" to some random number that went to busy tone. Kept going back to square 1 with support, explaining my issue over and over.

I finally get through to the store manager at the location I went to, explain the situation, and it's all news to him. He explains that they need to check the cameras and speak with the douche employee who helped me to see what happened. Kept asking if I actually bought it and just forgot. No, I'm confident I don't have the projector @[\_@](mailto:_@). When he got back to me, he told me the employee who assisted me is no longer there, that particular projector was not in stock, and they'd issue the $350 credit. If he's the douche I expected him to be, he probably pretended I bought the projector, then pocketed it to sell on ebay or some shit. Who knows.

Now I know I can't go past this barricade and get my items, but sometimes the employees can grab something for you if they're in said area themselves. 

I can hear employees talking so I push my cart four or five aisles up and see a group of them putting things away.  I waited for a lull and a nice lady that's helped me before and what I need. I mention that I was needing a few things from cosmetics and was there a possibility that she was able to get them.

She said no. They were stripping the floors/putting down something(?) that would eat the soles of your shoes off. YIKES! Well I didn't blame her, and said I understood. I was disappointed, but it happens. Then she hesitated and said that if I could find one of the guys actually DOING this they might be able to help me since their shoes were protected.

I wandered back to cosmetics and could hear a big machine being run. I just stood there until the guy saw me because I don't want to be a dick and yell over the machine. He stopped and asked if he could help me. 

I mentioned my problem but didn't tell him what the lady said about maybe him helping me.(Because maybe she just said it to get rid of me and I don't want to start crap between employees if she did)

He started to fiddle around with his shoes and I asked why. He told me he was taking then off so he wouldn't mess up the new stuff he'd put on the floor!! This guy took his shoes off, went over into cosmetics and grabbed my items. I felt like an ass, but I was grateful.

My computer screen has been acting up for about a year now every so often I’d have to press on the upper left hand side to make the screen stop freezing and for my mouse to work again (laptop). Recently it’s gotten bad where that doesn’t work anymore so I decided to swing by a computer store to ask them what the price to fix it. 

It’s a small town so I’m limited. I stop by and show them my screen and the guys say oh yeah you just need your screen replaced we can get you a quote estimate for that. Just fill this paper out. As I’m reading it I ask about the 38$ diagnostic fee the tech guy says “oh we won’t have to do a diagnostic test so I won’t charge you that.” 
He takes my computer to find out the type of screen it needs and I rush off to work. I get a call about 20 minutes later with a quote of 205$. Okay well I’m a full time
Student working ten hours a week definitely can’t afford that for at least a few week maybe a month. I tell the new guy who called me well I’ll pick my computer up tomorrow. He says okay well it’ll be 38$. I explain that the technician said there wouldn’t be a fee. He said he’ll look into to. 

I go today to pick up and the first technician guy was not there but a lady was. I explain I was told originally I wouldn’t have to pay. Since he knew what was wrong. She said well our tech looked up a computer screen for you out of his time so you have to pay. I explain I wouldn’t have let my computer here if I had known it would be 38$ just for them to tell me how much it would cost to fix. Anyways they would not give me my computer unless I paid and even though it doesn’t work a lot of the time I couldn’t leave it there due to school work having to be done. 

So I asked to talk to the guy who said I didn’t have to pay. Coincidently he was in a meeting. So I had paid and left. 

I sent an email when I got back to my dorm and received a reply stating “yes our tech did tell you that. Sorry he didn’t explain to you that if you don’t get it repaired here you have to pay no matter what.” 

No where in the paperwork I signed did it say that if you did not have the repair done there you would have to pay and I specifically asked about the charge! 

I feel that the employee messed up and I’m the one having to pay for it (literally). I was told no fee would be applied yet my computer was held hostage until I did pay. 

Unfortunately it’s a small company so I can not contact a higher up employee to complain and it’s a small town so they already have a solid clientele. 

It stinks to be out 40$ for no reason other than an employee messing up and I got punished for me. 

The email also said the woman I was speaking to could’ve waived the fee if she had felt like it.

I dropped the kids off in the play area, and came back just in time to step on my machine right at the top of the hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with televisions, there was also a large clock in front of us so that we could keep track of the time. I mostly stared at the clock, because I couldn't wait to get off the darn treadmill and do my strength training. I did notice that there was a man training on a treadmill just down from me, but other than that, nobody else was very close by. There were maybe 10 other people on cardio at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes past the hour (I had been on 20 minutes, 10 to go), the man shut off his treadmill and wiped it down. Then he came over and stood behind me. Weird, okay... I glanced back at him and he told me that it was his turn on \*this\* treadmill and that I needed to get off of it.  I told him that I had the treadmill for 30 minutes, to check the list, and that I still had 10 minutes to go. He walked off, problem solved, right?

&amp;#x200B;

This jerk walks back with an employee in tow. The employee told me that I needed to get off the treadmill. Loudly. I pointed at the clock to show him that I still had 5 minutes, both according to the sign-up list and the clock on the wall. The employee got even louder (other folks working out actually stopped to see what was going on). He told me that if I did not get off the treadmill RIGHT THEN I was going to be thrown out and lose my membership.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned off the treadmill and stepped off. My emotions are unfortunately connected to my tear ducts, and I still had some post-partum depression going, so I burst into tears. I went into the locker room to try to compose myself, and when that didn't work I just went to the play area to collect my children and leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about it, and didn't think that I was treated fairly, so I stopped at the desk on the way out and asked to speak to a manager. A female manager came up and I explained to her all that had happened. She said, ""And what would you like me to do about it?"" I told her that the employee who confronted me needed to be re-educated about the cardio scheduling, and he needed to know not to talk to customers the way he had talked to me.

&amp;#x200B;

She called the employee to the front, then gestured to me. I told him that I had NOT been in the wrong, and that he shouldn't have treated me like that. He threw up his hands, rolled his eyes, and said, ""SOR-RY!"" and walked off. The manager said, ""There, see? He apologized.""

&amp;#x200B;

I never went back.

556,jinjerbare,0,t3_ao0uir,35,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ao0uir/its_your_fault_you_dont_like_the_food/,"This was a few years ago, but it was a pretty wild experience.  

I went to a local Mexican restaurant which had really excellent reviews. I had been hearing about the place for several months now and was really excited to give it a try. 

When my boyfriend and I looked at the menu, we saw that the prices were really expensive, but figured that it was worth the price if the food was as good as we heard. I decided to order their specialty, the crawfish enchiladas, but asked that they come on flour rather than corn tortillas (something I have requested in several other Mexican restaurants without much issue).

Server tells me okay, but it will be a 4 dollar upcharge. Damn, that's pretty steep, I think to myself, but what the hell? I'll pay the upcharge. 

Our server finishes taking our order and brings out the salsa, which is a strange pink color. It tastes like it came from a can, and my boyfriend and I are really disappointed. We decide to hang around anyway--maybe it's just an off day on the salsa. 
Well, my food comes out. The enchiladas look pretty alright, and then I took a bite. They were insanely salty to the point that I could barely finish my first bite. They had no other recognizable spice or flavor aside from salt. 

Having worked as a server myself for a number of years, I always try to be extremely conscientious toward other restaurant workers, so even though I didn't like it, I thought I would just try an eat it anyway and never return--but I just couldn't. I could only force down another 2 bites. It was just so gross. 

About 90 percent of the plate remained when the server dropped by again to check up. When she asked how the food was, I told her as politely as possible that I honestly didn't like the dish, and I asked her to return it. 
At that point I had lost my appetite, so I told her I didn't want to order anything else and asked as respectfully as possible if she could please remove the plate from my check, since I had no more than 2 or 3 bites. The server goes to talk to her manager, and at this point, I have no reason to suspect that we would have issues going forward...boy was I wrong! 

When the server returns, she tells me that because I decided to change the recipe of the enchiladas (corn tortillas to flour) that *I* changed the flavor of them and that it's not the kitchen's fault I didn't like them. Therefore, if I don't want to eat them, she will throw them away, but I still have to pay for them. 
I was totally surprised by this. I know the flavor difference between corn and flour tortillas, and it certainly doesn't account for the intense salty flavor of the dish. 

My boyfriend steps in, seeing that I am getting really flustered, and asks the server if we can speak to the manager directly. A few moments later, the OWNER comes out of the kitchen and proceeds to scream in my face in front of the whole restaurant about how *I* changed his recipe, how he NEVER makes bad food, insists that a bunch of people have eaten those enchiladas that day and LOVED them, and that it's MY FAULT I didn't like the food. 

After my boyfriend insisted one last time that we were not paying for that food, we both stormed out of the restaurant.  By the time I got to my car, I was so flustered that I was in tears. 

After that, I blasted them on every review site known to man--they have even tried to have a public facebook argument with me about my review, again insisting its all my fault! I can't believe these people!
The last time I drove by that place I stopped my car and told that story to a family who was about to walk in there. They immediately turned around. 

Edit: minor details for clarity

Edit 2: To clarify, We didn't walk out on the check; We paid for the rest of the food we ordered. By ""we aren't  paying for that food"", I meant ""that plate/dish."" I realize that was poorly worded.",1,Its your fault you don't like the food.,149

Now when I wear makeup/live life I get bad skin. Again a very common problem that many people face. My solution? A four step face wash from a somewhat high end brand. 

So I run out of 2 of the 4 steps right around the same time. Crap. I miss a day I have a break out. Now I’m fine in my natural state and don’t like to cover my face when it breaks out because that will only make it worse. So I go to the shop I always go to to buy my face wash this time however I look like crap 1) because I’m in my natural state and 2) I have a pizza face. 

Now the stores kinda fancy (black and white striped bag) and on make up alone I spend easy $100 a month min. The face wash alone is about $50 per bottle x 4 steps = $200 in face wash and today I’m getting 2 bottles prob plus some extras so we are looking at a bill around $150 that day. 

I get to the shop and there are about 8 staff and maybe 2 other customers. Now this shop is really on point about getting you when you walk in the door. Today no one says hi they just look and walk away. 

Ok whatever. I know what I want. I go to where my stuff is and notice a staff member behind me. I start putting stuff in my basket moving around and the staff keeps following. And not in the “can I help way” but the “you don’t belong here way”

Also before anyone is like “racial profiling” Not the case more “you look poor and clearly don’t wear makeup”

I get to the a section and see a new pallet. I love it add it and now we hit that $150 mark. I keeping going about and the staff keeps following. 

So I stop SL: sale lady

Me: “Is everything all good?” 

Sl: yes I just want to make sure you know what you have there. 

Me: why?

Sl: well we normally make people keep our luxury items at the desk. 

*uhhhh no you don’t. I come here all the time, ya normally all made up but I need face wash so I can’t do that right now*

Me: is that new?

Sl:no

Now I’m kinda cool pissed and say fuck it. I’m not going to buy from them if they think I’m a them. Like ya I need face wash but I don’t need people who treat you poorly based on how you look. 

Lucky for my a local drug store has started to carry luxury brands and I can get everything there rather then the place where if you don’t look right your treated like crap. ",1,Sorry I don’t look like a good costumer. That’s why I’m here,701
558,dinosaursarewicked,0,t3_ano5v9,90,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ano5v9/bank_employee_advising_me_that_receiving_20_per/,"So this happened in the early 2000’s but was so ludicrous I had to share it. At the time I was still young and at university but looking at simple ways to make my money go further. So i’m at my bank (Canadian) which i’ve had my account since my paper route, and one day i’m just speaking with a senior advisor, woman in her fifties, with daughter same age as me and going to the same uni, who i’ve had friendly chats with and really thought was genuine until this one fateful day when i went to get a bank overdraft or something done. 

The conversation went like this:
Me: I’m looking at putting my savings in an ING (large dutch based bank) high interest savings account which will earn me around $20 per month.

Bank ‘advisor’: Oh that’s not a lot of money. (she’s continues typing on computer) 

me: Not a lot of money? That’s like a free pizza a month. 

Bank ‘advisor’: Oh that’s not a lot of money. We have good customer service here, and someone can always help you in person.

me: Well I’ve already received two payments in the past two months and the online user interface is easy.

bank tool: (repeats) Oh that’s not a lot of money.

me: ... 

me: I’m getting $0.02 per month here in interest. 

Bank ‘advisor’: (complete silence as she continues to finish typing in the computer, and becomes an awkward silence). 

We finish whatever it was. Then few days later I close my childhood account of over 10 years and always remember the time when a grown woman tried to convince me $0.02 is worth more than $20. How do people forget who they are and who they have become?

Note: This was in like ~2002 when this online bank was offering high interest rate. Like i’m talking 4. something %. Good times.

-Big banks at this time in Canada were starting an aggressive new method of giving out credit cards and having minimum balances on all accounts, and fees on every transaction that wasn’t in person etc.

-Everyone is right about the advisors job duties and pressures and following the company line. It was just an unfortunate moment in human respect and intelligence.

So when the holidays arrive since I don’t live near them I usually get a few cheques in the Christmas cards they send me. It’s a very kind way of giving me something without having to send a package. 

I grew up without the knowledge of how to save money properly and just general knowledge of money. But the last two years have worked with a financial planner and learned a lot. As a result, I budget very, *very* tightly so as not to over spend on anything. Whenever I get paid I take care of bills and automatically deposit most of the left over money to my savings account. 

Over the holidays I stopped at the bank with a small cheque from a grandparent in a different province. I’ve lost a cheque that I deposited in the ATM’s once and even though it was probably just user error have never done it again, so I went into the bank and spoke with a person. The interaction started very nice! She was kind and complimented my nails, asked where I go to get them done. She appeared to be very kind and I had to reason to believe otherwise. 

She asked me the reason for my visit as I put my card into the machine so they could get my account information. I handed her the cheque and said:

‘I’ve lost a cheque in the ATM once before, so I’d like to deposit this cheque please.’

She looked at the cheque, then looked at her screen and said, ‘Oh yeah, your account really needs it’. 

I was floored. I’ve never had anyone in customer service speak to me like that. I don’t like confrontation so I just shut my mouth and stayed quiet. She handed me the slip and I left. I cried in my car for a minute because of how embarrassed I was at the situation and had to remind myself that it doesn’t matter how my account looks to her because only I know my financial standing. 

It seems so minuscule thinking about it now, but I was so upset when it happened. ",1,Bank employee told me my account needed the cheque I was depositing,200
560,macmoosie,0,t3_anuyzd,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/anuyzd/warranty_sneakiness_and_unnecessary_membership/,"I should mention right off the bat that I've been shopping at GameShop for about 15 years now and it is rare, and I mean rare, that I have an issue. As a matter of fact, in the past 15 years, there's only two that I can actually remember and both were ultimately resolved.

However, my most recent trip into GameShop left me feeling rather concerned and uncomfortable. There are two GameShop stores in my area and I usually frequent what I'll call Store A. I personally know three of the employees including the store manager, it's my ""home store,"" and just a personal preference. I always have great experiences over there. Store B, on the other hand, I rarely go to. It's slightly further away, I don't know anyone there, and the store sometimes smells like vinegar.

Anyway, I went to Store B because they were the only store in the area that still had deluxe edition copies of Kingdom Hearts 3. After Worst Buy messed up my order (I still have an active GCU with 20% off) I called GS Store B and they held a copy for me. So I drove down and waited in line for about a minute and the GA started my transaction.

Now, I'm a very observant person and I take pride on that. I always pay attention during transactions to be sure I'm not undercharged or overcharged for my purchase. But I'm also not the kind of customer to make a big stink about mistakes or errors. I worked customer service for 7 years; I know what it's like. I am never unkind, or at least, I do my best to not be unkind. I have slipped a few times.

So as she's ringing up my purchase, I notice the $3 charge for the warranty that I did not request, nor was offered. Usually, the GA will ask me if I wanted to add the warranty to the game. I always decline; I've never and probably will never need it, since I treat my games properly and don't mishandle them. I don't have a problem with the warranty, I think it's great for people with rambunctious kids, unruly pets, or spiteful siblings. I've just never opted in and probably never will. However, she never asked me if I wanted the warranty; she just added it to the transaction.

Next, she asked me if I wanted to use my PowerUp Rewards points to renew my membership. I thought it was weird because I vaguely remember renewing it recently, but I couldn't remember. Either way, I said yes because she had it on the screen in front of her and it was either expired or due to expire soon.

So she gives me my total with the warranty still on there. So I politely pointed out that I didn't want the warranty on the game. She didn't give me a hard time about it, but she asked if I was sure and proceeded to tell me about it. I just reiterated that I didn't want or need it and asked her to remove it from the transaction. She did, without further contest.

Fast forward to today, I'm going through my receipts. I always hang onto my receipts until the payments post to my account, whether it be my credit card statement or bank account. I've read one too many horror stories about unauthorized charges or incorrect payment amounts, usually at restaurants.

Anyway, I find my receipt from November 2018 when I picked up my collector's edition of Hitman 2 and noticed I used PowerUp Rewards points to renew my membership then. So essentially, for what I don't know, the GA at Store B had me renew my membership 10 months early. I called GameShop Customer Service and spoke with someone in the PUR department and they confirmed that the first renewal was good until 11/19 and the second renewal extended it to 11/20. They had no idea why the GA had me renew when I wasn't due to and asked if I wanted to cancel the renewal or file a complaint, I declined both. I don't have to worry about renewing for two years now, so it's a win regardless.

I thought about filling out that survey and making mentions of the warranty issue and early renewal if it helps improve customer service, but quite frankly, it was no harm done to me. I definitely did not appreciate the sneakiness of the warranty thing at all, though. It just makes me wonder how many unobservant customers inadvertently paid for warranties they didn't want.",1,Warranty Sneakiness and Unnecessary Membership Renewal,22

The store was a outdoorsman place, with all sorts of winter clothing, boots, and shoes on sale.  And the place was packed.  Anyway, as I'm snaking my way through one section, I pass a middle-aged woman sporting *that* frosted haircut yelling at some poor clerk standing there with a deer-in-the-headlights look on his face.  I think the clerk was new, or a temp, because he wasn't wearing the store's uniform, but was wearing an orange safety vest with the store's logo on it.  He looked like he was barely 16 years old.  Behind the woman stood a man, I'm assuming her husband, loaded down with hangers full of clothing and looking embarrassed as heck.  I still don't know what the dispute was about, but as I passed, I heard the woman yell, ""You're an idiot!  Now go back there and look again!""

I swung around and snarled, ""Stop it!"" at the woman.  Then I stood between the woman and the clerk and asked him if he knew the woman.  (For some reason, the woman's tone reminded me of a bad mother yelling at one of her kids -- something to cover with a therapist one day, I guess.)  The clerk's eyes were brimming with tears, and he shook his head ""no"".  Seeing young kids cry really sets me off, so I spun on the woman and snapped, ""You're out of line.  Leave!  Now!""  I wish I was better with snappy insults, but I just wanted this abusive woman gone.  

The woman throws up her hands and starts telling me what a fuck-up (her words) the kid is for not finding whatever she needed in the storeroom, while her husband rolls his eyes and starts pulling on his wife's purse strap to move her out of there.  A manager suddenly appears behind the clerk, just as I'm saying ""I don't care *what* your complaint is; there is *no* reason to speak like that to anyone.  Ever!""  

I look at the husband and tell him that his wife shouldn't be allowed out in public.  Then I look at the manager and tell her that her employee did nothing wrong.  Then I get on with my shopping, figuring that I'm an unnecessary party to whatever is coming next.  But, I keep an eye on things out of the corner of my eye.  

Husband dumps his armful of clothes (all women's clothing, btw) on a nearby table of shoes and walks out of the store.

And abusive woman spends a minute or two yelling at the manager about never shopping there -- ever again! -- before running off after her husband.  Who, if he's a smart man, has already driven out of the parking lot and was headed to find a good divorce lawyer.

But here's the good karma part:  I get up to the front of the line of the cash register next to the customer service desk.  And find out that the pair of boots I grabbed was the only one without a price sticker.  I apologize and tell the clerk that there were about 20 pairs of the same boots on a clearance table, and I *thought* they were marked at $38, but I wasn't sure.

I was running a bit short on fuel and my stomach was loudly proclaiming in displeasure in my choice of times to fill it so I started hunting a place to stop. 

A sign almost jumped out at me immediately and a short drive later saw me pull into a truck stop. I lined up at a pump that had a sign saying pickups and smaller vehicles were to use this pump to fill, but as it was on the truck line, I chose it. It was late at night, I was the only one around and I didn’t think the attendant would care. 

After filling those things (300 gallons takes a bit), I turned and started off inside to get my stuff, pay for it all and get on my way, when this black pickup pulls up and starts honking.  It sure what’s going on, I went up and asked the driver, a short haired, overweight, 30 something woman, what was the issue. 

She proceeded to regale me with a long tirade of what ignorant buffoons truck drivers are and that I was in “her” lane and to move.

I tried to tell her I wouldn’t be long and that I was sure there was no difference in the pump beside me,  it she wouldn’t let me finish my sentence and again regaled me with even more reasons why truck drivers shouldn’t reproduce.

This happened about 3 days ago, at a fast food restaurant with a certain yellow arch as its logo.

Okay, on to the story. Me and a friend were out for a drive when both of us decided that we were hungry. Being American teenagers, we decided to stop at the fast food restaurant mentioned earlier.

As we walk inside, we're both deciding what we want. Both of us decided that a 20 piece nugget along with two smoothies sounded good. I tell my friend to go sit down as I go to the counter to order. All is going well, and my order sounds good.

""What can I get for you today?""

""I'll take one 20 piece nugget and **two small strawberry smoothies.**""

""Alright will that complete your order""

""yes.""

""Okay, that will be [price]""

I don't remember the exact price but i remember the two small smoothies being around 2 dollars each, making them around 4 dollars in total (not including the nuggets). So far, all is going well. I wait for our food by the counter. An employee calls out my order number, and hands me my tray. I take the tray from him and walk it back to the table I can see my friend sitting at.

Now sitting at the table, I look down and realize the two smoothies are in fact two **large milkshakes.**

I think to myself, ""Okay, just a small mistake, I'll just go and ask them to switch them out for some small smoothies.""

I looked on the receipt only to find that the milkshakes were printed on it.

One more detail to note is that the two large milkshakes were somewhere around 3 dollars each, making them around 6 dollars in total.

I go to the counter and explain the situation to the employee working the counter. 

""Okay, sure,"" she says. A minute later she comes back and hands me the smoothies. I take them and am waiting for the 2 dollars that I am owed (6[milkshakes]-4[smoothies]=2).

Finally I ask for the 2 dollars. 

""For what?"" she asks.

I reply, ""Because you charged me 6 dollars for the milkshakes and these cost 4.""

Confused, she goes and gets her manager. 

As the manager is walking towards the counter where I’m standing, I can already see he has an annoyed expression on his face. Now, I completely understand that workers in the service industry have to deal with some ridiculous customers, and that it can be very annoying. I, however, don’t think my request for my 2 dollars back was all that inconveniencing.

M will be manager. Z will me me.

M: What seems to be the problem

Z: *I explain the situation*

M: Okay, but you’re actually saving money by exchanging the milkshakes for the smoothies.

Z: How do you figure that?

M: Well since the smoothies cost more than the milkshakes then in reality I’d have to pay *you.*

Z, confused and slightly annoyed: Sir, I’m pretty sure that the two large milkshakes are more together than the two small smoothies together.

M, with attitude: Um, no it’s not.

I gesture to the menu above him.

Z: No, look. The small smoothies are [around] 2 dollars. The large shakes are [around] 3 dollars each. 4 is two dollars less than 6, sir.

The manager at this point has a completely blank expression on his face. He stands there behind the counter for around 5 seconds trying to process what just happened. Finally, he says, “Sorry sir, I’ll go get your money.”

I thank him, expecting him to just open the register and get some quarters or 2 bills. To my surprise, he goes back into the kitchen, not to be seen until about 3 minutes later. What was he doing back there? I don’t know. The whole time this interaction is occurring the poor cashier is standing off to the side with an apologetic look on her face.

I'm sorry if this is going to be a bit ranty.

Today after work I popped into the high end cosmetics and perfume store on my way home from work. I work in a Kindergarten and can look a bit dressed down after work (our ""uniforms"" are yoga pants and a long sleeve t-shirt, not the most stylish). I live in Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia and the only verified retailer of Max Factor is a high end store chain with only very expensive brands. Max Factor is definitely the cheapest brand in store. I was just there to buy a back up of the foundation I use and to swatch a lipstick from the brand. 

When I enter the store, I'm the only customer and the two sales workers are just sitting drinking coffee.

The products are behind glass doors and I then approach one of them to get to take out the foundation and test out the lipstick. As usual she's trying to get me to instead have a look at their more expensive brands but I just politely but firmly ask her to please open the door towards the Max Factor shelves. She just pretends not to hear me and shows me Chanel and Guerlain foundations.

I understand wanting to upsell and I know the trick used in upscale stores to make the customer want to prove to the rude sales assistant that they can indeed afford buying stuff in said upscale store. But after six attempts to get the product I wanted I just leave.

I felt bullied and looked down upon because I asked for the cheapest brand and it just resulted in them not getting any sale off of me.

We stayed with her of course through the whole process and we were both petting her when she went.

As we left, my wife noticed that they had lit a special candle that basically tells everyone coming in that someone’s pet is going through this process and please be considerate and be quiet.

The fact that you can order from pretty much any chain-restaurant online is a blessing. 

I've had super positive experiences with all but a run to oil-bearing-tree-fruit vegetable patch.

However, my most interesting To-Gos occur at Cinnamon Butter Steakhouse. I'll set the stage for the most recent visit.

It's 7:30p on a Friday night, and my Dad and I roll up to the Meat Palace. It's getting late and the parking lot is only 96% full. It's cold, so no one is outside aside from the nicotine addicts.

I take the initiative and open the door. The wood-sided vestibule is lined with people flowing into a separate foyer. They've been waiting for 45 minutes and are either settled into their phones, spacing out, or are eyeing the crowds around them. The group leaders remain suspicious of any movement towards the hostess stand. Although they've got their pagers, they know it's the wild west out there. They await the call of the hostesses like the pioneers did during the Oklahoma Land Rush; quick to look for an abandoned lot, but are wary about the possibility of claim jumpers.

Leery, narrowed eyes follow every step my father and I make. They clench their pagers like holsters - ready to jump in at moments notice if this interloper duo makes just the wrong move. They grit their teeth as we approach the hostesses. 

We ask for the To-Go area; the ravenous patrons lean in, blocking our path. We're vaguely directed to the next desk over. The To-Go desk was shielded by a envious middle-aged couple. Their arms hesitantly  slithered together as the To-Go Waitress inquires about their order, only slinking away as we are recognized as the true patrons of the online request.

We tried to lay low as we waited for the Waitress to return with our goods, but the glares remained unbroken. I'm still sure that it was a miracle we were able to receive our bags without being stabbed. The swarm had swelled since we initially stepped in. Our path to freedom was blocked by a gangly teenage boy, staring into space. I knew what I had to do.

In my Ranger voice I called out:

""Excuse me, sir!""

The beast startled his pack, leaving my father and I a small window to escape the envious carnivores. 

Thus concludes our adventure. We then arrived home safe and sound.

We walk into the super aesthetic small bakery. Now the place was basically empty and there were two people eating together, a boy and girl. Now there was this nice table tucked in the corner. The table was still visible from the front desk and only a couple tables down from where the two were enjoying their meal. When we walk up to the table we see an abandoned wallet. So, we looked at the ID in the wallet and tried identifying any of the guests.  No match as far as we can tell but, we noted the name. So we set the wallet aside on the next table and keep an eye on it in case someone comes back for it. The two people get up and go to the back. The man approaches our table no less than 5 minutes later. He says that is his wallet so we ask for his name. It’s a match so we hand over the wallet. He leaves and returns after another 5 minutes. 

This is how the conversation began. Employee with be E. 

E: umm there’s $50 missing from my wallet. 

Me: Oh I’m sorry but we didn’t really touch the wallet. It was there before any of us even got here. 

E: seriously just hand over the $50 it’s fine I won’t be mad. 

Me: Sorry but we don’t have your money. 

E: I know this is embarrassing but seriously hand it over. I know you took it. 

Me: You were sitting two tables over. You would’ve seen us take the money. 

E then leaves and comes back about 2 minutes later 


E: Well if you’re not going to give me my money I’m going to have to ask you leave because I work here.  

So we are in shock because 1) He accused of us stealing money from his wallet that was somehow placed on our table two down from where he was sitting and 2) If he works there he shouldn’t be accusing us unless he has proof. He easily could’ve looked at the cameras and seen that we didn’t take anything out. Since there was a camera right above us. We ended up leaving with our drinks and shocked about how an employee tried to scam us out of $50.

Picture this, it's halfway through January, and despite the weather, it's somewhat warm. Two young partners are traversing 4 hours from home for a romantic getaway. M = me, B = partner, R = retriever
_______________

Now that I've set the scene, onto the story.

B and I were travelling far from home to a pretty town on the coast for a weekend, I had saved up for weeks to try make sure I had enough money to treat him, leaving me with a significant amount of cash in my purse. 

Along one of the few stops, we stopped at a service station to get snacks and use the amenities, etc. All was good and well when we left, until about an hour later into our trip when I get an alarming message:

R: Hi Gemma, I'm the manager of a service station, have you lost your purse? 

M: No, I haven't..

I check my handbag frantically and almost burst into tears. It wasn't there. I hurriedly tell B what the situation was. And got him to stop for a moment at the nearest town and turn around.

M: s--t, yes, I have. Sorry. We'll turn around right away. F--k.

R: It's alright dear, I just found it outside on the ground and figured someone dropped it.  It'll be here waiting for you.

Quick as a flash, we turn around, driving the 45 minutes back to the service station to retrieve my purse. I dash in, and R seems a little cautious about just giving it away, I tell him my full name that's on my licence and collect it. Afterward I went to sort myself out in the bathroom and count the money in the purse (which thankfully was all there). 

I gave R 20 dollars for his kindness and honesty. If I had waited any longer to check my handbag, I may have very well not been able to turn around.

So thank you to the manager at the service station! He helped us have an amazing weekend. 

TL/DR: Lost my purse on the way to a vacation, R retrieves it and messages me about it, we turn around and retrieve it. Added two hours to our overall trip, but we still are thankful for R's help, honesty and kindness.

I was in a supermarket with my family and we were walking around, when my Dad sees a worker reducing bakery items on a trolley, and tells me to go see what I can find. I’m a kid so I got excited that I would be getting some brownies or something along those lines, and run over to the trolley so see what’s available. Most of the boxes were bashed up or open in some way, but I saw a couple good boxes with the yellow sticker which I knew meant that they were good and that they were reduced. As I go to pick up a box of cookies the worker pulls the trolley away and continues to do her thing. She was a pretty big lady and I was a small kid, so first assumption is that she didn’t see me. I go again to pick up one of the boxes, and as I have it in my hand, she takes it off of me. Now, I don’t really know what to do, I wanted these cookies and I wasn’t one to argue. I tried one more time and she start giving me grief. She said something along the lines of “stop it your ruining the boxes” and told me to go away. I stand there for a minute shocked in a way when she starts staring at me. She then ushers me again that I’m bothering her and I need to leave and not touch anything.
I’m now getting upset and run back to my family, and my Dad assumes that I haven’t found anything. He doesn’t say anything but realizes I’m being quiet and asks what’s up. I tell him the lady was rude to me, and he immediately takes my hand and walk back over to get me to show him who the lady was. I see her standing over by the trolley and point her out to my Dad. He takes me over and asks her what the deal is. She starts telling him that he needs to control his child and that I’m going to break things and get in trouble. Now my Dad has a bit of a temper sometimes, and I know this got him mad.
He begins to shout at her telling her what does she know, and shouts at her for being rude. She argues back with him telling him that I was crunching up all the boxes, and points the boxes which I had allegedly had ruined. My Dad knows I’m not like that so doesn’t even question me, and he called bs and left the situation. He took me away back to my Mum and sister, and tells them what happened. My Mum gets wound up and they both go and argue with her again, while I stay with my sister and stand back watching as they all get irritated with each other. In the end I think they spoke to a manager and got her in trouble, and she was known as a poor worker in the first place.
My sister who at the time was 13 or 14, looks at me while they were all arguing and says she’ll get me something nice. We go over to the sweet section and she picks up a wham bar (chewy strawberry and cola sweet which are 10p) and puts it in the basket. My family is now all together again and we’ve left, I’m happily eating my sweet, and my parents are frustrated discussing how stupid the women was.

Grabbed a pint of ice cream and some DOTS for the spousal unit.  As I came around the aisle to make my way across an empty expanse of the shop to the checkout counter, I see just one register open, and the cashier is leaning on her elbows on the counter, speaking with a customer who has her purse laid out on the counter.  The customer even turned around to see me approach, but turned back and kept speaking to the cashier.  I got closer and stood behind her to wait my turn.  The cashier makes eye contact with me, so after that I assume she's going to have the customer either move along or at least step to the side so she can ring me out, because now that I am close enough I can see that this customer is not buying anything/or their purchase was long completed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nope.  They continue to speak in hushed tones, and the cashier is asking this lady more questions to keep the conversation going, at no point did it seem they were going to wrap it up.  No ""one moment ma'am"" or anything.  Just both looked at me, then turned back to continue their personal gab session.

&amp;#x200B;

What I did next my spousal unit said was too nice.  I stood and counted to 20.   Conversation still very heated.  So I just turned around, put the DOTS back on the shelf, walked back over to the freezer and put the ice cream back, and just walked out of the store.  I get back to the car and husband asks me wtf?  So I mention that a personal conversation was apparently much more important than ringing me out.    (He told me I should've set my purchases on the counter next to the lady's purse and THEN walked out of the store.  I probably should have.)

&amp;#x200B;

As we sat in the car, not leaving yet because husband wants to go back in to see if she'll wait on him instead, he pulls up the gas station's corporate site and has me start writing a complaint to them.  I get through typing the same amount of text as this post and submit it, and in that time there are now three actual customers in line  - and the cashier is STILL talking with her friend and not ringing anyone out.  By the time we were pulling away to go to another store, the lady finally exited and got in a truck parked right in the front of the station.  

&amp;#x200B;

???

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, counting to 20, like slowly too, may seem like I'm being impatient - but its waaaaay too long to wait when there is literally NO ONE in front of you, it's a personal conversation, and you've been noticed and ignored.  I don't mind if you want to keep talking to your friend while you work - in fact, I've seen it happen in this gas station before with other cashiers.  They stand off to the side, but people still get cashed out and can go on their merry way.  I don't think I'm being super rigid here, but I'm sure the internet will tell me if so.

EDIT: TLDR at bottom

So, this was a few years ago. It was my birthday, and my family and I decided to go to a nice restaurant for dinner. It was me, my big brother, my dad, and my mom.

The restaurant wasn’t busy, so we were seated very quickly, and we met our waitress. She was a younger woman, maybe 24ish, and she was a bit standoffish. We didn’t pay too much attention to that though, and just focused on having a good time. We all order, and my dad gets a bacon burger, and specifically asks for the bacon to be cooked a little longer because he likes crispier bacon.

We get our food, and his bacon is raw. Like, put in the pan for two seconds raw. It’s BAD. My dad, being a non-confrontational person, is disappointed, but simply takes it off the burger. My mom sees this, and flags down the waitress, much to my father’s chagrin.

M = mom, W = waitress

M: Excuse me, this bacon is undercooked, could you send this burger back and make us a new one.

W, after looking at the bacon: it’s cooked ma’am.

M, shocked at this woman: Um, no. This bacon is raw, please make him a new one.

W: I could take it back, but the chefs will tell me the same thing I told you. This is how we cook it.

M: I know how to cook bacon. Get us a new burger, and get me your manager.

The waitress finally backs down and takes the burger back. My dad gets a new one, and the bacon is perfect. The manager comes over, my mom explains what has happened, and he continuously apologizes to my parents, and says he’ll take care of it.

I’m not sure whether he fired her or not, but whenever we go back, and we go back pretty often, I’ve never seen her again,

Now, every time a friendly argument happens in my house, someone will say, “I know how to cook bacon!”

As the custom dictates, we went out to eat together on his last day to the new location of a pretty known pozole restaurant. One of the things I love about this place is that their prices are fair and they're fast as hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were nearly 20 people, so they put together 2 tables and sat us down. A guy came and told us since we were a lot they'd be running 2 tabs: one for each table but we could order from anyone that worked there and they'd find the appropiate tab to put it in. Good, whatever makes this easy for you. So we start ordering and, I'm not kidding you, like 10 people start bringing food. We pass food from one table to another 'cause they're handing it wrong and some drinks are wrong (they did not want to change them swearing that's what we order, but my coworkers just want to eat so...) and I quickly realize they're leaving things we did not order. Sure, be my guest at trying to pull a shitty move. Some of the not-ordered food gets eaten by the other table and the rest is just left there. No one but me wants dessert so I order it. 10 minutes later I call one guy and tell him I ordered dessert and it's not here yet. 5 more minutes and I do the same. This time a new guy brings it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We finish our food and ask for the tab. They deliver one to my table and I start checking it. Nothing in there is what we order; the other table is facing the same thing so we exchange tabs and things start to make sense. Since everyone pays for their own food I start to mention plates and the cost so everyone can add up what they ate and hand the money. I finish and 3 things are clear: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) They've charged my dessert 3 times.

2) They've charged us things we did not order (and are still on the table, untouched).

3) They've under-charged some plates.

&amp;#x200B;

So I call one of the waiters and tell him this. He just looks at me and goes away. Great! I call another waiter and repeat myself; this guy tells me we order the extra plates. I show him how they're still at the center of the tables, untouched, 'cause no one ordered them and we're not gonna pay for their scam. I also highlight the wrong prices and the repeated dessert. He goes away with the tab, comes back with a bad attitude and a new receipt and goes away without a single word. The other table payed and got up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I check the new tab and he erased all of the extra food, but didn't correct the undercharged plates. Fine, I tried to help you but you're being an ass, so you can pay the difference from your pocket. I collect the money and try calling for a waiter to take the money. Legit, everyone is ignoring us. After 15 minutes I just tell my coworkers if they don't want to charge us, we don't have to pay. The second a foot is set out of the door a waiter comes and asks us to pay. I tell him we've been waiting for 15 minutes and no one was paying attention, and unlike them, we actually had to work. I hand him the money (no effing tip) and get out. 

&amp;#x200B;

That day I wrote a lenghty email to the company explaining every detail about all of this, not only because I wanted the waiters to be punished, but because the chain is exactly the opposite. I've been gong to their different locations for over 15 years and never had a problem: they're super fast and nice, never gettting any order wrong and always helpful to the point I always leave a 20% tip. They answered me within the hour thanking me for the info and letting me know they'd be sending someone to check things up. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went there again like a month later and things were completely changed. The new waiters got our orders correctly and promptly, and charged us exactly what we ordered. They got their 20% tip.",1,You don't want to do your job? Then you won't have a job anymore,190

I frequent a coffee chain in my area. Always the best quality coffee and the best customer service! A new location opened up that I had not been to and it was in the perfect location for a business meeting.

After sitting down to dine-in, our waitress - from here on will be called rude waitress (RW) - greeted us and helped us find a table with an outlet so we could work while we had coffee. She promptly brought us water and took our order when we were ready. We ordered two drinks. RW didn’t write down the order but it was simple so I didn’t think on it too long.

When RW brought our drinks, they were both prepared hot so I mentioned I ordered my drink iced and asked if it could be remade. I was not upset in any way... this happens often and I know I have made the same mistake myself when I was a barista!

This is the dialogue from that point:

RW: Do you really need it redone?

Me: Yes, I would prefer the drink iced.

RW: That’s not how you ordered it.

Me: I am 100% sure I ordered it that way, but it’s ok! I don’t mind waiting for a new one.

RW: Look- it’s not in my history here as iced (she shows me a screen with my order).

Me: You may not have remembered me saying iced when you put it in the ticket but it’s fine. I still would like a new one.

RW: Why?

Me: Um, I just don’t like oat milk steamed and like the texture better iced—I’m sorry, I’m not sure why I have to explain this?

RW: Here (handing me the mug) just take a sip of it and then make a decision.

Me: I do not want to drink this one since it isn’t what I ordered, I’m sorry. I don’t think it is a big deal to make a new one?

RW: Just take this. (Sets down the latte)

Me: You can take it back to the barista for a new one, I don’t need this one.

RW: No. I’m leaving it here.

There were a few more “just take a sip” and “I would prefer not to” thrown in there but it was just so repetitive that I didn’t include it. The whole conversation lasted about 3 minutes.

At this point she walked away and I was SO confused! My sister actually works for this company and told me the policy is to always remake a drink if the customer is unhappy with it. No excuses.

After this, the manager on duty brought my new drink and as I was about to say something about my weird encounter, RW appeared close by. I really did not want to make a “thing” of it in front of all the customers so I kept my mouth shut. Every time I saw the manager and was going to bring it up, she walked up nearby as to discourage it.

My second drink was made improperly (sugar free vanilla) but I didn’t say anything since I was honestly so upset already, and felt so uncomfortable and worried it would make a scene if I told RW.

RW never came by the table again to ask if we needed anything. To get our check, I had to call her over. When she got close by I said “Can we have our check now?” And she ignored me and turned to another table and asked if they wanted their check...

Finally she came over to us after one more call by my friend. She tells me our total is over $20 and I said, “Wow, $20 for two drinks? I’m not sure about that.” And she proceeded to tell me that’s how much my order costs. I refused to pay the amount since I figured she was charging me for the original drink. 

Finally, she corrected it and charged us for the drinks we actually consumed ($13 and some change). I asked for a receipt since it was a business meeting and I needed it to hold on to. She told me she would get it and then never came back. I asked the manager for it and he handed it right over... that’s when I saw my second drink was input wrong as well.

I emailed this to the manager at that location and the over director of operations. I’m still shook.

TL;DR Waitress gets my order wrong and tells me to drink the wrong order in front of her when I ask for it to be fixed. Then she tries to get me to pay for the extra drink.

UPDATE: The manager reached out as a reply to my email and apologized for the “bizarre interaction” with the server. He told me it will be handled with her on their end. He offered me a gift certificate for the trouble and asked me to give that location another try if I find myself in the area.

I want to start off by saying I have great respect for IT workers - they have a rough job and often difficult users to deal with. This though... I keep half hoping to see a post on r/MaliciousCompliance that's definitely them but, even then, this would suck just because the collateral damage is kind unfair. 

Anyway, there has been a push lately to comply with ""best practices"" by company IT. Some of the policies make total sense, some don't or aren't received well. It would help if IT were a bit more communicative. 

I'm not sure when it started exactly but, where people used to get a quick 'just an FYI, we're updating X next Monday' things started happening without any warning at all. 

Some internal functions would be discontinued (including one that they previously said was staying), changes to accounts, maintenance that would take down critical functions during working hours. 

The worst of these was the office copier incident. 

A lot of employees have their own little desktop printers but the company really only had the one ""big"" one meant for large and/or specialty jobs. It had its own room filled with different paper varieties and finishing supplies. Everyone knew where it was. 

Until, one day, we came in and suddenly realized that it was gone. Not offline - people would just show up to pick-up their prints or to begin their copies to find that the whole machine and all of its attachments were gone without even a post-it note left to acknowledge its previous residence. 

Cue days of confusion and rumors until, finally, one of the administration staff (*not* IT) sent out a memo saying the copier had been moved to a different part of the building and there was also a new process to print/copy that involved a login. Also, now you either had to bring your own specialty paper or put in a support ticket ahead of time. Found out later that this was a decision from the bosses in the IT department.

Now, obviously, I'm not exactly in love with the move at all, but I have a hard time understanding why they would do something so big without warning and then without any kind of update in the following days. The copier going MIA screwed up a number of people's days (and a few people ended up going outside the company to print which was needless extra cost). 

Tl;dr: ""It's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission"" and radio silence are lousy policies for company-wide changes.",1,Why would the users need to know that?,17
581,queenofstarts,0,t3_an39v1,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/an39v1/entitlement_on_super_bowl_sunday/,"So, yesterday was a certain pigskinned sporting event that is known as the biggest televison event of the year. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Honkers, that bird named chain known for wings.

Anyways, when we arrived, it's pretty crowded, but not too insane. We put our names on the list - hostess says about an hour wait. Coolbeans.

Note: there is standing room in front of the hostess stands (where BF and I were) and benches inside the vestibule. (The doors connecting the vestibule and entrance have promotional posters on them) The benches were all packed, including a mom sitting down next to her daughter who is in a motorized wheelchair.

Mom: We've been waiting over an hour, and my daughter's in a wheelchair - can we skip the line? She's very hungry. 

Hostess: Ma'am it's first come first serve - I'll see what we can do but until then you have to wait

Mom: [grumbles off]

[10 minutes later]

Mom: Can someone please pull off those posters off the doors? My daughter cannot see the game because the posters are blocking her view!

Hostess: Let me grab my manager—

Manager Ma'am, we cannot do that, but if you and your daughter want to come wait inside, you can both see the game

Mom: I CAN'T STAND!!! I have to watch over my daughter and I have a medical condition as well

[This woman is making such a scene and people are looking away - BF and I decided to hightail it out of there.]

We ended up going to a local place, and despite the game being a dud, I had a great time.

On a whim, I decided to check the Honkers' Pelp* page - one star review detailing ""discrimination"" and ""poor customer service"" - of course with certain details edited out.

582,stormageddon103,0,t3_an3pyq,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/an3pyq/steak_came_out_cold_restaurant_didnt_believe_me/,"So this weekend I went to a high-end chain Mexican restaurant for dinner with my girlfriend and her family. I ordered some fillet fajitas cooked rare, my order was the last to come out which was no big deal. When I went to start prepping my food I went to feel the steak because it looked more blue rare than rare so I felt it with my hands, and the outside was cold. Not room temperature cold, but as if they had just taken it out of a freezer cold. It almost felt as if someone had taken  ice cubes and set them to melt on top. 

I called the waitress over and tried to explain to her the issue, and she tried to explain that rare steak is typically cool in the middle. The manager came over and tried to use the excuse of ""It may have sat in the prep window too long and gone to room temperature."" All the while me trying to explain that it wasn't cool, it was actively cold. After finally getting my issue across by telling him to touch the outside they finally took it back and brought me a medium well steak.

I'm honestly just trying to figure out how a steak comes out cold and not just cool. I wasn't angry or frustrated by them, it was just weird to have them tell me that a rare steak was supposed to be cold.",1,"Steak came out cold, restaurant didn't believe me, still trying to figure out exactly how it happened.",12

584,ekelliewhite,0,t3_amvvpv,20,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/amvvpv/our_local_vet_made_the_best_out_of_worst_case/,"This is long, so i do apologize but I’ve seen a few vet stories and it really makes me excited to see so many great vets out there. It reminds me of my vet and how she’s a genuinely great person who loves her job. She made the best out of a horrible experience. 

A little bit of back story, I’m 19 &amp; my husband is 20. I recently moved to South Carolina in August 2018 to be with him. I work in my local block chain pet store, and they have those big cat adoption rooms that get cats from local shelters/groups, and that’s where we got our cats. 

Anyways, we got our first cat [Jeannie](https://imgur.com/a/HIJQSRu)in September, we wanted to adopt older shelter animals, and she was there the longest. In November we weren’t looking to get another cat, BUT I grew quite attached to a cat we had in my store’s cat room, [Amos](https://imgur.com/a/TaiHN14). I had shown Amos to a few families, but he was a little bitey &amp; was half blind and mostly deaf. 
I begged and begged and we finally brought the little guy home November 17th. Besides being a little nervous he was a total mommas boy. Things were going great, he was more comfortable in the house and he was super happy and VERY vocal.
My husband and I still frequented the local shelters and we found a beautiful husky named Bane. His paperwork said he was cat friendly, so we signed the paperwork, got all of the things in the world he would ever want/need, and headed home. I put the cats in the separate bedrooms so Bane could explore and the cats could have their separate space. And by complete accident my husband opened the door to our bedroom, where Amos was. Amos has always been the type to run and hide when nervous, and that’s exactly what he did. Amos ran past my husband, into the living room, and right towards the dog. Bane pinned Amos to the couch by the throat. It was suddenly very evident that the dog was NOT cat friendly and that he was a threat to our cats, but more importantly Amos was seriously hurt. It was pretty late in the night, and we weren’t sure what to do. My husband called around and a vet in the area was open late but about to close, they said to come in and they’d see him. 
On his first visit, his mouth was swollen, he had some puncture wounds in his neck, but they said he was going to be okay. They gave him some pain meds and sent us home with Amos. In the morning we went straight back to the shelter, surrendered the dog, and let them know he wasn’t cat friendly. They were super understanding. 
Amos didn’t seem to get any better, he hid all the time, the swelling in his mouth got worse so he was unable to eat or drink. So we made another appointment with the vet he had seen, he was severely dehydrated and they kept him from morning to close for observation and fluids. Our vet was the most kind lady, her and all of her staff never brushed off our concerns or emotions, and they NEVER bullshit us. Amos continued to decline, our vet told us that what it seemed like was a serious neurological issue from neglect in the shelter mixed with old age(11years), aggravated by the dog bite. She called us frequently to update us on his conditions, told us all the time he was the sweetest cat, and when he was home with us she called to check in on him. 
We were at the vet daily for a week, sometimes he’d stay overnight. Throughout his last few days his health rapidly declined, losing 3 pounds when he was already underweight, dehydrated, could barely move or balance, completely deaf at that point, and our vet gave us two options. She told us we could get a feeding tube put in and hope force feeding him would fix the issue, or we could make the hard decision to put him down. She told us she didn’t think with his age, current condition, and known injuries that a feeding tube would fix it. It was probably the worst day of my life hearing that, but I deeply appreciated her honesty in the situation. She never bullshit us, never once ran a million expensive tests that didn’t relate to the situation, even stopped charging us after a certain amount of things since we were two young kids visibly distraught over losing our cat. 
On December 13 we made the decision to put Amos down, we spent his last few hours holding him and telling him how much we loved him. He was cremated and his ashes were spread at a beautiful lake by the people who cremated him. 
Since losing Amos, we’ve gotten hand written cards from the vet office, the office who cremated him, local shelters who reached out to us, and vets we didn’t even work with. Amos bonded with so many people while he was passing, and it broke so many hearts to lose him. One of the vets even donated to a local shelter in his name. Losing my buddy so shortly after getting him was heart wrenching, but it was amazing to see how many people he touched at that office. She is now our primary vet, and still talks with us frequently about Amos. We still get the occasional random letter from a vet, or shelter about him. It was an awful situation, but Amos was so loved by everyone he met. ",1,Our local vet made the best out of worst case scenario,176

The get a manager involved and tell him that something is wrong with the card and he just stands there as she walks away and does not care to explain to him what happened. He continues to say “I don’t understand” and they just ignore him and tell him the card isn’t working and to pay some other way or leave. I’ve worked in a grocery store before and this is NOT how you handle shit like this. They could have suspended his transaction and brought him to the manager station to talk to him. This would have prevented his obvious embarrassment and it would have helped to get the other customers checked out.

Yesterday, me and my SO were paying our grocery at an automatic cash of this big chain Italian supermarket. It was 9pm of a Sunday, so everyone was pretty stressed. My SO pays, but in collecting the change she drops 1€, that ends up between two machines. We were all tired and stressed but she didn't want to leave it like that, so we begun moving slightly one part of the machine  (nothing heavy, the part where you put your stuff before scanning) while looking for the coin and an employee. We find only the latter, and we ask him if he could help us.  


He then started moving the machine, and then searching with a pen and a piece of paper for a solid 3-4min, kneeling on the ground. He collected 70c all in 5 and 10c coins (So kinda 9-10 coins left by others), but our coin was nowhere to be found. We then decide to keep them and leave, but he asks us to wait, goes somewhere and then comes back with the last 30c, giving everything to us and wishing us a happy Sunday evening.  


We do not know his name and we didn't think of asking him it, but we were really amazed by his behaviour at the end of a very exahusting day and we really like to thank him properly, sending a mail to a superior, reviewing the store on Google or anything. How would be the best way?

Unfortunately, my digestive issues means I can't eat most of it, so after work I stopped at Taco Shell.

I got to the window, pay, wait around while my food finishes up. Lady hands me my food, tells me to have a good night and starts to shut the window.

I remembered that I had so I called after her, ""Miss, didn't I order an orange cream smoothie?""

She turned to ask someone about it and they told me the machine was frozen. They didn't tell me this when I was paying or getting my bag of food. Never mentioned it. They were gonna let me drive off without my drink. Were they thinking I just wouldn't notice that part of my order was missing?

Everything started off well and we placed our order. For some context I can be very fussy with my food, I always apologize for this when ordering, and I’m also pregnant so there are certain things I’m not allowed to eat at the moment! 

I went for something quite easy and ordered a chicken breast burger and asked them to just include the chicken, bacon, cheese and bun....nothing else! 

When the food arrived they had removed the salad but left everything else....I was going to just leave it and pick off/scrape off the stuff I don’t like....however it included a runny egg, which had run over the burger so this is a big no when pregnant (disappointing as I love runny egg but not risking it for now) so I asked them to remake it!   I reiterated that I just wanted the chicken breast, bacon, cheese and bun! Simple right! 

Waited 10 minutes (where the rest of the table had almost finished eating) and my burger comes out.....everything removed except the egg!!   Luckily this time the egg hasn’t run so I just took it off!  Thinking yay finally I can eat as I’m starving at this point! 

Luckily I cut the burger in half before eating to find the chicken wasn’t cooked....and not just a little undercooked, a big part of the burger was dark pink....completely uncooked! 

My boyfriend was seriously unhappy by this point as not only could this have harmed me and the baby but they shouldn’t be serving food like this to anyone!!  

I gave up in the end and told them not to bother remaking it again....not only did we not have time but I couldn’t trust anything they gave me after that!!

589,24haley42,0,t3_amt0zf,31,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/amt0zf/patrick_your_racist_is_showing/,"|UPDATE: So, I went back to the gas station a little bit ago. No sign of racist lady, but the employee working was one of the girls who I know decently well from how frequently I enter the station. I asked her whether or not the woman had been fired, and she got a little secretive but did finally tell me that the woman had been fired. Apparently she made a pretty big scene about it too and broke one of the doors, according to the employee I talked to (can confirm there’s a huge crack in the glass and the hinge release at the top is bent!!). 

I also would like to add in response to everyone asking me to expose this woman on Facebook, I don’t think I’ll be doing that. I’ve talked to some family members and friends who are police officers about the idea and they all informed me that it could end up being bad on my part—if I were to make a post and something horrible were to happen to the woman in response to it, I could be found somewhat responsible and even possibly sued by her. Trust me, I want the justice boner of seeing her getting served with some steaming karma just as much as you all do, but I don’t really want to risk any legal issues on my part. They also told me it could be a risk to my own safety if her or anyone she associates with tries to retaliate and/or come after me, which I also don’t really want to worry about.

I’ve spoken to another family member who is a journalist for the local newspaper in the town that the man lives in (really the only popular newspaper in my area), and she said she’d speak with other staff on the paper to get their opinions on maybe doing a story about it. She’s not quite sure it will get much traction with anyone on the paper but she’ll get back to me, so I’ll keep everyone updated on that!|

This happened last week. The dialogue might not be exact but it’s pretty much what went down that night

I live in a pretty tiny town. Roughly 3,000 people population, and there’s one lone gas station on the Main Street through the town. Only 4 pumps and typically one or two employees working. I frequent this gas station, but after this... I’m pretty sure I’ll be driving to the one outside of the city limits from now on. 

This is in the Midwest and happened last Wednesday, during the whole polar vortex fiasco so it’s about -40F windchill outside when this happened. 

It was like 11pm, and I go to the gas station to pick up some snacks and stuff before heading to a friend’s house when I see a man literally pushing his very old, very beat up car through the parking lot to the pump. I ask if he needs any help, though I’m about 115lbs and not the strongest so all I can really offer is to steer for him while he pushes. He’s super polite and says no, but thanks me for offering.

I head inside the little “store” of the gas station. There’s a new employee I’ve never seen before, she’s probably in her 30s. As soon as I walk in I can hear her making fun of the man and laughing at him. Calling him all sorts of names and racial slurs (he was Mexican). 

So, I’m already super irritated with this lady. How fucking rude and disgusting of a person can someone be? Apparently, she gets even worse than that.

Now, I know that employees reserve the right to refuse service and that if someone has a large amount of coins the employee has the right to refuse it and ask for another form of payment. Well, this man finally gets his car to the pump and comes inside to prepay. He’s got a ziploc bag of change (I’ll admit, a lot of change. Probably like $15 of quarters, nickels, and dimes).

At this point I’m behind him in line and watching this all go down. He puts the bag on the counter and opens it. “Hey, I’m really sorry, I know this is a lot of change but I’ll help you count it... it’s all I’ve got. My car’s out of gas and I need to make it to -next town over- so I can make it to my house.” 

Racist bitch looks at the bag, looks at him, and LAUGHS. Laughs so hard she irritates her fucking smoker lungs and starts coughing. “Yeah, no. I’m not counting that. Go find a change machine and come back.”

Man looks like he’s about to break down in tears. “I... Is there one here?” 

“No. We don’t have one. There’s one in -huge retail store- though!” She responds, smirking because she knows that the store is IN THE TOWN HE NEEDS TO GET TO. 20 MINUTES AWAY. She knows his car is out of gas and broken down, and she knows he can’t get to it, and is gleefully and sadistically telling him she won’t take his change so he can freeze to death outside in the fucking -40F windchill!

Man is straight up crying now. Like silent tears just running down his face. “If I count it all will you take it? I can’t make it there. I told you, my car is out of gas.” 

“No. Either pay with something else or get out, -racial slur-.” She snaps, straight up pulling her phone out and texting. 

So, I’ve already been pretty damn pissed watching all of this go down... but at this point I fucking break inside. Man is literally crying, racist bitch is snickering to herself like it’s hilarious. He walks back outside to dig through his car, probably trying to find any paper bills even though he already knows he doesn’t have any. 

“Excuse me, if I give you money to prepay, can you just go ahead and turn on his pump?” I’m trying to be polite, even though every part of me wants to jump over the counter and gouge her eyes out. 

She looks absolutely disgusted. “Why would you wanna pay for some -racial slur-‘s gas? Stupid immigrant should just go back to his own country.” This bitch probably has a fucking confederate flag tattooed across her ass, with an eagle flying out of her asshole. Epitome of racist white trash. “I’m not taking your money. If you wanna pay for him that’s your problem, go give to him yourself. Fucking -racial slur- lover.”

Oh boy. I literally have to count to 5 to stop myself from doing something that will get me arrested. I’m not much of a fighter, as there’s rarely a time where I’d ever have the physical advantage (unless I was fighting a literal child), but this woman damn near made me throw all my restraint out the window and turn into a total psycho.

“You’re a fucking disgusting waste of a human being. What gives you the right to be so cruel?” I snap, and drop all of my shit on the floor (couple drinks and some random junk food), and walk out to the man who’s still digging in his car. “Excuse me, you said you needed to get to -next town over-?”

He hops out of his car, his face and hands are literally BEET red because he’s been out in the cold and his face was wet with tears so like... frost bite happens fast when it’s this cold. “Yes! I don’t have any gas and she won’t take my change.” 

“This is all the cash I have on me. I know it’s not a lot but it’ll be enough to get you there.” I gave him the $10 in cash I had been planning to use for my junk. “I’m sorry that she was so cruel to you. No one deserves to be treated like that, and no one should be left stranded in weather like this. I tried to pay for you, but she won’t let me... so I’m sorry you’re gonna have to speak with her again.” 

Man is so thankful he’s nearly crying again. “Thank you so much! Do you want my change? You should have it since you’re giving me money.” 

I tell him no, that he should keep his change because he needs it more than I do. I also tell him that I’ll be waiting and watching to make sure that she actually takes the money and lets him get gas, and I’m unsure this guy even has a phone to call for help with. 

He goes inside and I watch through the windows and he and racist bitch argue for a few moments but eventually she does take his money. I pumped the gas for him as I could literally see his face getting frost bitten, and I also wanted to make sure that the bitch didn’t fuck him out of the $10 of gas. 

So, once the gas is pumped he once again thanks me profusely and I just keep telling him that it’s no big deal and that everyone deserves basic human decency. Gave him a hug and told him to be safe, and went to sit in my truck where the adrenaline of the situation wore off and I finally started shivering violently from how cold it was and finally noticed that my own hands and face were stinging pretty badly.

Waited to make sure his car started up and watched him drive off before I finally made my own way to my friend’s house. Never learned the man’s name, have no idea if he even made it home or not, but I sure hope he did. I hope he finds a crisp $20 bill every time he’s walking down the sidewalk, bc fuck he deserves some good after dealing with that. 

I’ll never go to that gas station again. I sure hope someone teaches that horrible piece of garbage a lesson one day, and am a little sad that I won’t be the one to do it. 


TL;DR: -40F windchill, racist bitch refuses to accept loose change as payment for gas from a man whose car has broken down. I pay for his gas and will never go there again.

590,mandolin2712,0,t3_amzsls,7,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/amzsls/frustrating_experience_today/,"I was in a local discount store today with my children, just browsing mostly. This is one of those places that has a little bit of everything, usually stuff that's been damaged in shipping, or was replaced with newer/better stock in the store it originally came from. 

We were mostly in the toy aisles and kept seeing this one guy with an orange backpack on. He was fairly young, maybe around 23, and had tattoos all over his neck. I was getting a little paranoid because he seemed to be in the same aisles as us frequently. But then, he just went another way. 

A few minutes later, I heard one of the cashiers call for security to electronics. I really wouldn't ever think this store would have security, so that did make me feel a little better. 

We saw the guy a couple more times as my children went through the agonizingly difficult process of deciding which toy they wanted, but I just made sure they stayed close to me and tried to head a different direction. Yes, I was feeling kinda dumb for feeling paranoid, but there was just something that made me uneasy. 

When we finally managed to pick out toys and went to pay, the cashier was talking to another cashier behind her about a guy with a backpack on and how it was flat when he came in, but now it was bulging. He came towards the front a minute later and she was just staring right at him while he tried to duck her gaze. 

So, I guess that's why I felt uneasy. He was obviously up to something. He went over to where some DVDs were and pretty openly put one in his pocket. Everything there is *super* cheap. I got a little espresso maker for $5. The DVDs were 50 cents. This is not stuff you need to steal to be able to afford, and none of it is necessities. 

She loudly said to the other cashier ""He just put a DVD in his pocket,"" while still staring at him. Everyone waiting in line turned to look at him and he just made his way to the back of the store again. She told me how much she hated the fact that they can't really do anything and that the honest people are the ones who end up paying more to make up for people like him. And she said she didn't care if she lost her job today. She wasn't going to let him think he got away with it. And she called security to the front door. 

The security guy came up and he was probably around 6' and 180 lbs.  He looked pretty muscular, and I thought maybe he would do something to stop the thief. Thief guy walked towards the front door, spoke briefly to security guy, then just walked out and got on a bicycle and rode away. 

I follow r/talesfromretail and I've seen many posts about being frustrated about shoplifters and not being able to do anything, but I've never seen it irl. That was freaking infuriating. 

On my way out, I said to security guy how awful it was that they really weren't allowed to do anything, and once he started speaking, I felt 10 times worse for him. 

Security Guy was very obviously developmentally disabled. I'm not sure in what way, but he definitely was. He was so angry that he was about to cry and he literally wasn't allowed to do anything to physically stop thief guy. And I could tell he felt like it was all his fault.

I was out with friends a few years ago at a Tex Mex place and ordered a combo that came with a little side salad. I'm not big on lettuce, I wasn't planning to eat it, I just wanted the rest of what was on the plate. 

I've eaten the taco already when I happen to look down and see a little tiny green caterpillar/worm crawling along the edge of my plate. I yelped in surprise. The waitress heard me, came rushing over, I showed her the caterpillar.

She's apologising profusely, I'm not upset, I was just surprised. She takes my plate before I can even argue and brings me back a brand new combo, with a new taco on it. Sweet, I'll take two, I like those. I thank her, she apologises again, okay.

The manager comes over a bit after that and sidles up to the table, asking if I want the meal comped. I'm cool, I already got a free taco and it's not like that little bitty caterpillar hurt anything.

So I'm at my local neighborhood big name grocer getting food for the week and my monthly money order for daycare.

We timed it so we were there right before the Superbowl starts so it's not super crowded, but crowded enough. My daughter at one point put me in my place when I was growling in the Chip aisle (she asked me why I was cranky and I had to explain mommy feels 'affected' by lots of people so I was trying to get out of the aisle where there were less people)

In the end, we survive grocery shopping and go to the courtesy desk for the money order. Here, my daughter starts touching the pretty Valentine's garlands so I tell her ""Hey. Don't mess up the decorations, someone worked very hard on that.""

The cashier that was helping me looked up and said ""wow, I like that. I respect that.""

And that is how I learned that other parents probably just let their kids tear down pretty decorations without any home training given in return.

Anyways this is an oldie but a nasty goodie. It was early summer 2007. I was in the drive thru of the local Taco Bull. I made probably the easiest order I could that afternoon. A grilled stuft burrito. No special order just a burrito.

After I paid for what I thought was gonna be a quick lunch I was pulling the burrito out of the bag and low and behold a hair. Now at the time I was pretty lax in life and just tried to pluck it off the wrapper and go on, but fate didn’t want that

I pulled on the hair and it actually lifted the food. I was still at the window and asked the girl for her manager to come up there.

Him: Is there a problem?
Me: yeah. There is a hair.
Him: A hair? Are you sure? What color is it?
Me: It looks red
Him: I don’t think we have anybody here with red hair.

I then picked up the burrito and showed him that not only was a red hair sticking out it was folded all the way into it. I pulled a good 10 inch hair out of it coated in meat and beans. 

Me: So where did THIS come from?
Him: Holy shit ( his exact words and his expression matched) do you want us to make a new one? 
Me: uhm can I just get a refund?

He took the burrito back and handed me my money. In retrospect, I probably should have held onto the burrito but I was young and honestly didn’t care enough to report them to the health department or even file a formal complaint. Never did find out if the hair was locally sourced or came from the food.",1,The longest hair,23

We took him to his favorite Thai place near us, and things were initially good. B has zero tolerance for spicy food though, and a flair for the dramatic. I’d ordered a really spicy version of the same soup as him (mine was a level 5 and he’d ordered a 0) and they accidentally got mixed up. it happens to the best of us, the soups were identical and B was being grabby. He took the soup before she even finished saying “Tom Kha”. He took one bite and freaked out, we swapped soups and plied him with water to make sure he wasn’t a jerk to the waitress over the mix up. 

The problem came when he finished guzzling his water. He was talking loudly about how “GOD IT BURNS” and breathing heavily- really laying it on thick for one or two spoonfuls of soup.  He held his cup up in the air and jiggled the remaining ice loudly at any workers that walked by, none of whom were our waitress! It had been maybe five minutes since she’d given us our appetizers, if that. 

She eventually walks up and asks if we’d like some more water. B is already shoving his cup to the end of the table by her and saying “SOO SPICY WOW” as if it’s her fault he took the wrong soup from her. At this point he’s also dramatically patting his head down with a napkin. 

And that’s when this waitress makes my entire life so much better. She smiles at him... and fills his friends cup up first. Then, she looks at her half-filled jug of water and earnestly says “sorry, I’ve got to go to the back and get you guys more water.” and walks back. to.  the. kitchen.

The waitress walks back a minute later and doesn’t even look at him, just fills my glass to the brim first before she finally turns to him with a big smile and says “so, who else wants water?”

“Im sorry guys but the grandstand is full and I can’t let anyone else in”

So I was shopping at a very popular grocery store here in the South. And if there's one thing people know about this grocery store is that it has the best sandwiches ever that are made in the deli. So I was in line waiting to get one of these wonderful subs. It was a very busy night for the deli, and they were getting a lot of online orders for sandwiches. 

One man who ordered online got his sandwiches and left. At first, I didn't think much of it. But then five minutes later, the man returns. 

Angry Sandwich Man = ASM, Poor Employee = PE.

ASM: *yelling at everyone working in the deli* Can SOMEONE tell me why I was given two cold sandwiches when I asked for them to be HOT? And why I was charged for hot sandwiches when they're clearly cold?!

*Note: the deli does not charge extra for toasted/hot sandwiches*

PE: Excuse me, sir, I made the sandwiches. What seems to be the problem?

ASM: I order two HOT sandwiches and got two COLD sandwiches. But I was charged for hot sandwiches!

PE: Okay, one minute let me pull up your order. *pulls out ASM's order* Um, sir, your order clearly said to not toast these sandwiches. I'm sorry if there was any confusion. 

ASM: *gets huffy and drops sandwiches on the counter* Well I don't want them then! *storms out of store*

All of us in line were just staring in disbelief. The employee had to throw the two sandwiches away.  I felt pretty bad for the employee seeing how backed up the deli already was and how he had wasted his time on two sandwiches that he had to throw away. 

P.S. the man had already paid for the sandwiches. The deli probably would have been more than willing to remake the sandwiches or toast them. But instead he left before they could offer him any help. He basically threw away nearly $15.",1,Don't Cry Over a Cold Sandwich,28

When I used it, it always looked the same as it was when I first bought it. There was no plastic or fancy packaging around it. It was slightly dirty (not noticeable) from my makeup bag, since my dark brown Milani concealer kind of leaves brown residue streaks all over my makeup stuff (that's the problem with liquid makeup). When I bought the product last week, I used the self checkout registers and that was the only product I bought. The receipt from last week said the word ""Foundation"" on it although it is not even a foundation product. The product costed $11.72 and even the receipt says $11.72. I went to return it today and when the woman scanned my receipt and the product, it did not match the product. How weird... She knew the product was used since it was a little dirty. I asked if I can just do a no receipt return. She didn't even offer me merchandise credit for the return even though they are allowed to do that with no-receipt-returns or products that looked used.

I drove to another location of the same chain store today and the employee had the same issue where the product didn't match the receipt.

Lil background, near my place is a very small shopping centre, most of it is taken up by a supermarket, but there’s a few small stores around it, including a small sushi bar I enjoy going to (they make a damn good avocado roll), side note: if you ever get sushi from a place that near a [Clown themed burger place recognisable by their Golden Arches], do yourselves a favour and get a tub of Big Mac sauce, it sounds like a crazy combo but the two go very well together, trust me. Occasionally they let people set up a table either inside the centre or right outside the front entrance, usually its folks collecting for various charities or local businesses advertising their services (things like insurance, dance classes, paintball, etc)

So on one particular day about 3 years ago I’d finished my grocery shopping, i had a lil extra money in my budget so figured I’d splurge on an avocado rolls.

The line for this place was a lil long (which isn’t unusual as a lotta other people like their sushi too) and I took my place at the back. There happened to be a table set up at that time and the line happened to end right next to it. I forgot what they were selling but remember I was not in the least bit interested

There were two ladies behind the table, they greeted me when I got in line and I politely said hello. They tried to talk to me about whatever it is they were selling and I just said “sorry I’m just here for sushi”

That wasn’t good enough for them and they kept talking at me. After telling them a second time they weren’t interested they kept at it. All the while the line was moving slowly and I was getting slightly further away from them (not fast enough)

They keep talking and I decide to start ignoring

They yell at me that they know I can hear them, that I’m being rude

At this point I leave the line. Walk up to them and tell them that there is a fine line between selling your service and outright harassing people, they had just crossed it. I told them I had already said no and it’s not my fault they’re not accepting that as an answer. That from now on I would never patronise their business due to their rudeness. Then stormed out

Went on to complain to centre management (also told them that thanks to these two I did not end up getting my sushi, so they were actively disrupting established businesses). They have not been back since

Edit: because I’m sick of arguing the point I’ll post it here. Big Mac sauce is NOT thousand island dressing. Anyone who wants more proof than merely tasting the two should just google “is Big Mac sauce thousand island dressing”. The answer, even according to the Clown Himself (aka the burger chains own website) it is not (I’d post the link but it has the name of the chain in it so I literally can’t in this sub)

Anyway, the cashier was clearly new, a little shy and quiet but it didn't bother me. His manager was standing over his shoulder, off to the side behind a wall, watching him conduct the transaction. I ordered the flavor I wanted, he pulled out the standard size and wrote my order on it, and as he was doing so, his manager was like, ""okay so are you *asking* them what size they want or are you *assuming*"" in a quite frankly, rude/condecending tone. He kinda mumbled something and it threw off what he was doing. 

I immediately reacted and said, ""No, that *is* the size I wanted he got it right"".

Necessary Background:
Normal we try to overlap our leases by a few days, but no one on either side would budge this time. We were lucky enough as it was to get keys to our new place on the afternoon of the 31st rather than the morning of the 1st.

Because of the tight time schedule we had, and the fact our new place was an hours drive away from the old place, I made sure to book our moving truck rental well in advance for the earliest possible time on the 31st. The website showed 2 options in our town, so I picked one and booked it. Confirmed and everything. 

Day is as planned: Get truck at 8am, help boyfriend load truck until noon when I had to drive the hour to get the keys to the new spot, drive back an hour back to the old spot to help finish loading, spend the next 5-7 hours cleaning the old spot while he took all the stuff up to the new place and started unloading, drive back to finish unloading and drop off the truck. Dear lord was that day already going to suck.

The story:
2 days before the move I received an email saying my reservation is confirmed for 10am at a different location from the one I selected. No big deal, I didn't mind the different location part, but I really needed every single minute with that truck because our schedule was so tight. So I tried calling but no one answered. The spot was about a mile from where I worked, so I figured I'd just pop over and talk to her in person the next day.

So I show up the day before our move to a small storage place, and see zero 20' moving trucks anywhere. Seemed a bit odd but I let it go. I went in and inquired about whether I could pick up the truck early. A truck I clearly could not see.

The woman, who was very nice, explained that the truck hadn't been returned yet. The folks had had it for nearly a week at that point. It was originally scheduled to be returned a few days prior, but they kept extending the reservation. But they absolutely had to have it returned by 9am the next day as they could no longer keep extending the reservation. So that's why I received a 10am time frame.

Me: ""Okay, but what if they don't show back up with the truck?""

Lady: ""What do you mean?""

M: ""I mean, what if they just don't return it and it isn't here tomorrow at 9am for me to take at 10am?""

L: ""Well I highly doubt that will happen. They've had it for quite some time now. I'm sure they'll get it dropped off this afternoon.""

M: ""Okay but what if that DOESN'T happen?""

L: ""I don't think it'll be a problem.""

M: ""No. I need you to tell me what happens if I show up at 10am and there isn't a truck here. What happens?""

L: ""Well, I suppose we'll look to find another one in the area that you can get instead. But I doubt it'll be an issue.""

So I leave, less than 24 hours before I'm supposed to pick up this truck that two people keep forgetting to drop off.

9:30am the next day, I've been cleaning for the last 2 hours because it needs to be done anyway. I'm about to leave to go get the truck, when she calls me.

606,obbycake,0,t3_amelbr,11,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/amelbr/vet_offices_touching_animal_lives_and_people_lives/,"I read a story recently on TalesFromTheCustomer that prompted me to consider writing one of my own about my experiences at the vet.

I had my cat Symon for about ten years (June 2009 to January 2019), all throughout college and into my young adult life. When we first got him from the local animal shelter, we took him to a vet under the recommendation of a friend. Very rarely was it more than ""check pulse, check eyes, check ears. Good to go."" About two years ago, he developed an issue where he was throwing up constantly and the vet simply gave the advice of ""change his food until he can eat it normally again."" I had bad vibes from him from the getgo, as he did not have very good bedside manner; however, I gave it a try.

Unfortunately, that didn't really fix the problem, and we ended up taking him to ""a new place"" closer to home that had really great reviews. It was by far the best decision of my life. I called the vet's office and described the symptoms, and because their offices had extended business hours (from 8AM-8PM), they told me to bring the cat in right away as something did not sound right over the phone.

When we got there, we were greeted and taken back with the vet. They did an analysis / listened to his lungs, heart, and felt around his intestines. It turned out that he ate something that got stuck and was causing him to throw up periodically. They referred us to a 24/7 pet surgical location and he was good to go for a little while.

A couple of months past by and he still wasn't eating like he used to - so we took him to the ""new vet"" again. The vet felt around and said that they would probably need to do imaging to find out what was wrong - and that the vet could squeeze that into her schedule today, but it would be in a few hours. They kept Symon in a little play area and when we came back later in the day they showed us the imaging and told us that he had Lymphoma that went undetected.

I cried, and the vet and vet techs were there with tissues to console. She gave suggestions for medications that would extend his life without too much pain.

But -- the main reason of my story wasn't anything related to the above, it was more of background. Symon passed away earlier this month, and we took him to the same vet -- called Monday morning at 8 AM, they told us that they could fit us into the schedule to be euthanized that morning at around 9:30 AM with the same vet that took care of Symon throughout his time. The entire office was very sad when we walked in -- they knew me, and Symon by name because of medication pickups. The vets all gave us time to say our goodbyes and explained / executed the process.

I expected that to have been the last time they would have mentioned Symon. However, a week later, we received a letter in the mail -- a personally signed card from everyone in the vet's office with personalized messages (I'm one of those ""analyze the pen.. was it really written in pen or stamped??"" people) about Symon and about all of their interaction with him.

I'm sure that they do that with every pet -- but it definitely felt special. After my experience with the first vet office where it seemed like such a cold environment, our vet office now has made us feel like we are a part of their family.",1,Vet Offices -- Touching Animal Lives and People Lives,123

I recently had a family trip to an indoor water park lodge thing. We'd never been there and we weren't sure how everthing worked. Just inside the doors of the water park area, there is a stand where you check out towels that are only to be used in the water park area (you can only have out x per room) and there was a lady who collected used, wet towels and handed out dry ones.

On the first day, I walked up, noticed her nametag, and asked her, by name, a few clarifying questions about how the lodge worked. Over the next few days I just instinctively greeted her by name each time in took or brought back towels.

As we were leaving, I was waiting for my wife to finish changing out of swim gear and I see her get stopped by the towel lady. She kind of laughs and catches up to me.

The towl lady had apparently stopped her to let her know how much she appreciated the way our family had interacted with her and that we always called her by name.

My fiance and I decided to go out this evening to a TGIChillibees for dinner tonight. We go to one not too far away where we live. Weve had good experiences there before and we just wanted to relax. When we arrived we were seated with a waitress that we have had a few times in the past. She is a bit forgetful due to brain surgery she had had in the past but she had always been talkative and friendly! Weve never had any issues before. Let's call her T. 



About the time we were supposed to be getting our desserts T comes back in absolute tears. Shes obviously trying hard not to cry or let it effect her but she can hardly speak. My finance and I are somewhat shocked at the sudden change from bubbly and friendly to crying. We asked what was wrong and she started talking through the tears, but she wasnt really easy to understand. I tried to get her to sit down but she declined. After a few minutes she manages to pull herself together and explains what happened. 



Apparently T was supposed to have been cut (not sat with anymore customers) for the evening, but unfortunately there was a pop at the end of the evening and she had to stay. Right after we had been sat, another table had come in. Now this table was sat in another section from our server but they requested T. The server in the second section was unhappy and felt like T had stolen a table, although she didnt want it. Instead of talking to her about it, he apparently yelled at T in the kitchen about it. Then when T tried to get a managers help (let's call him M) he refused to help her. Out of aggravation T slid a hot hand down the table and it accidentally bounced off of another servers leg. (A hot hand is a small cloth to hold hot handles, and weighs almost nothing). 



M then told her to leave, and T refused to leave without her tips for the evening. M then told her he would call the police on her if she did not leave and that he had already transferred her tables to other servers. That is when she came out crying to my fiance and I. 


I was fairly shocked to say the least. I felt terrible for her as well. Although I couldnt really help her I tried to keep her calm. She was well enough to and grab our dessert, and I asked her to send her manager out so I could at least have the ticket to tip her. M comes out and I asked if we could please have the ticket with her so we could at least tip her because we had no cash, and M  refused to transfer a ticket back to us for ""legal reasons"" and told me to take his advice and not to deal with our server anymore. I was disappointed but I accepted defeat and thanked him for speaking with me. I theorized she was most likely fired at that point. 



When she came back she, T started to ask what M had said then almost dropped our plate because the police had arrived. I took the plate from her before she passed out and she flew out the door to go meet the police. After that another server appeared to finish our ticket. We spoke to the replacement server for a little and the server told me that if we tipped her she would make sure the other server would get the tip from her. She also gave us some more details on what was going on and we left not too long afterwords. 



The server did get the money (the replacement server immediately checked us out and got the money to give to the server who was standing outside with the police), and I believe T did leave. My fiance and I have decided not to return to that location ever again. Needless to say it was an eventful evening.

I’m a bartender at a family style restaurant. On Tuesday, I had a short break between shifts, so I went home to check on my dogs: let them out of the kennel, drink some water, go outside to pee and throw the ball for a few minutes. They would have been fine for a few more hours until my roommate got home, but I like seeing them during the day, it’s worth the trip home and back. 

I noticed that my girl Lulu was favoring her paw and wouldn’t walk out of the kennel. She’s a tough girl. I rescued her from an abusive owner, she’s not prone to showing pain (my other dog is a baby and is overly dramatic about everything, so she’s usually the one who gets rushed to the vet). 

I take a look at her paw and her nail is split all the way up into her cuticle. A bloody, torn mess. She must have done this the day before, but again, she never even hinted at discomfort. I called the vet, expecting from experience from my previous vet, that they’d tell me to schedule an appointment. I fully expected to have to call in the next day or wait until the weekend. But the lady on the phone said, “sounds like she’s hurting. Bring her in right now, I’ll see if the vet has a minute.” 

I get there, he looked at it, said it needed to be cut and cauterized. He said that the visit plus treatment would cost $100, but hey, they have this laser nail cutting for all nails would only cost $85. and that they would just cut and cauterize the broken nail while she’s under. 

So they got her in and under right away. Took care of her nail, cut the rest of them. All for cheaper than what I was expecting to pay. Then they called me at work to update that she was awake and ready for pickup (already arranged for roommate to pick her up). Also, it was apparent that they were short staffed for the day, but they still let me bring her in without an appointment. 

They were just so amazing. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to thank them. So I brought the office two dozen cheese biscuits from my restaurant and a gallon of sweet tea. The lady at the desk remembered my dogs name and asked about her! They seemed to enjoy the snacks, and I am so glad I switched to this vets office. They went above and beyond for my girl.

So earlier this afternoon I (24m) went to my local Wal-Mart for a quick shopping trip. I get in and see that it is fairly busy, but that was expected as it's a Saturday afternoon. I get in and get my shopping done quick ending up with only four items. One of these items is in a security box that they open at the register, this is important. My mistake was not checking out in electronics. I should've known the front end would be busy and the last item I grabbed was in electronics, however I walk up to the front end to check out. Now I've never been a fan of self check out; I always end up with more headaches than necessary, and I really don't want to deal with the security box. Self check out is packed anyway so I head to the express line. As only Wally world knows how to do they have only one express line open with about 8-9 people waiting. So I stand about 5-6 feet behind the last person because standing directly behind them would've caused a blockage in the main artery of the store. I'm in line for less than 2 minutes when I notice an employee walk between myself and the person in front of me and gesture to elderly woman standing beside said employee. Before I even have enough time to process what's happening another elderly gentleman, about 60-70 years old and standing in a completely different line, looks at me and says,
""Why dont you go to self check out. She only has a couple of items.""
Sure enough lady only has one or two items. Had this guy given me a couple seconds to figure out what was happening I would've gladly let the woman in front of me to check out first. However being the non confrontational person I am, and being a bit stoned, I stutter out something like,
""Y-yeah...o-ok.""
I go to walk away and am stuck for about 30 seconds due to the traffic. All the while this guy is staring me down. As soon as it clears up I start to walk back to self check out when this guys goes,
""Yeah just go to any of the ones with a green light.""

I went into a well known gaming store because I needed some retail therapy after I’d had a rough day at work (had to explain to a kid why my mom “isn’t here anymore” and “yes that means I can never see her again”, so i needed a breather). My spouse used to work at another location, so I knew where to go to find the merch-centered stores. This particular store had a lot of cute collectibles, and I figured it would cheer me up. I perused the collectibles aisle for a bit, then got a few items. I went up to the cashier, he rung me out, and then he told me the total without even mentioning anything or asking about power pro rewards (they have a whole spiel they have to do).

I was like, okay, whatever. I have an account, here’s the number. He seemed genuinely surprised, and stared at the name on the account (it’s my spouse’s name, I get that it’s a male name). At the time I wondered why he looked so taken aback, but then I realized that it was probably because of the thousands (if not more) of dollars, preorders, and points we’ve accumulated that popped up on the screen. And all of a sudden he was pushing pre-orders on me like no one’s business. I told him I was just here for the items and no thank you. Then he asked what system I had, and continued to try and sell to me. I told him I appreciated him offering and I know he has stuff he needs to offer, but I literally just want this and I need to go back to work. He frowned and handed me my receipt (without even mentioning the survey).

Like, I understand that y’all have shit you have to say and offer and try to get corporate off your ass. I get that you have sales goals. And I understand the feeling of having your eyes light up like it’s Christmas morning when you see a big spender. I’ve been in retail. What I found annoying, though, is the fact that he wasn’t even bothered to do the minimum for his job (am I a rewards member?) for me until I had to tell him I was a member and he saw I was super active, and only then did he push stuff. The number one rule in sales: Don’t judge a book by its cover. That’s how you lose a $600 sale by ignoring someone who doesn’t look “rich” or like they’ll buy anything and catering to a “fancier” customer who will walk out having spent only $20.

I still bought my stuff, but I left feeling annoyed instead of happy.

On December 31st of 2017, our 4-month-old puppy started to throw up and have some issues during potty time. Our regular vet was closed for New Year's Eve (along with pretty much every other vet in town), so my husband and I took him to a 24-hour vet.

So, the vet tech sees him and we tell her all his symptoms. She immediately tells us that he definitely has parvo, that there is no cure, and that all they can offer is supportive care.

We're a little taken aback at this snap diagnosis and tell her that he's up to date on all his shots. She says that, even after receiving all the parvo vaccines, that puppies under one year old can still contract parvo but she will do a test to show us.

She takes our puppy to the back and we're waiting in the exam room for what felt like forever just worried out of our mind. Finally, she comes back and tells us the parvo test came back negative. Based on this new evidence she concludes that our puppy definitely has lepto and she needs to test him for it.

Now we're pretty annoyed that she basically let us think that our puppy was dying, but agree to let her test for lepto. Another 20 minutes go by and she returns and says that he does not have lepto either. They are not sure what he has, but want to keep him overnight for observation.

At this point we are fed up with the unethical scare tactics. If she would have just told us she wanted to check for parvo and lepto we still would have let her do the tests, but telling us that our puppy is dying and then essentially going ""just kidding"" was very emotionally draining on us. We let her give him some fluids for dehydration (from the vomiting), but told her we would be taking him home with us.

Story: I had taken our daughter to see her dr. three times to figure out why, what appeared to be a really bad inflection, was not clearing up. ( it turned out to be earwax buildup that was clogging the tube, we had it removed once we figured it out.)

I came up to the counter to tell the pharmacy tech that yet again we needed to pick up medications for our daughter. They already knew that our insurance had dropped and were extremely patient with our insurance dilemma.

They randomly took my trash can last Wednesday, which surprised me because I had no idea why. Of course I immediately log onto the website and realize we haven't paid since October, okay, that's definitely my bad. You see, for some weird reason, they charge from your debit card instead of from your checking account like every single other company. So when a combo of mom/pregnancy brain had me losing my debit card three times last year, I remembered the first couple times to change the info but forgot the third time.. Oh well, I paid one lump sum to catch the account up, then called the company. And called, and called, and called.

 Their system kept bumping me off the line, and when I finally did get someone and explained the situation, she said they didn't ever actually have an order to take our trash can and shouldn't have done that. Okie dokie then... So she transfers me 'to the right department ', which ends up with me just back at the beginning selection process, where I have to start all over again, just to get dropped. We'll I called back about seven times over the next two days, only to get dropped every single time after waiting several minutes each time. I finally talk to a real live human on Friday, who says again they never even had an order to take our trash can. But hey, he'll make sure we have one delivered by Thursday! So okay, we'll just refrain from taking out the trash for a week, that's cool.

Obviously, it's Friday, and I'm ranting because they never gave our trash can back. So I call again this morning, get kicked off, call again, talk to someone who AGAIN says they weren't supposed to pick up the trash can and it should have been delivered yesterday... Thank you Sherlock. She then transfers me to a different department, who says they need to see whether or not it'll be delivered tomorrow, so puts me on hold. And then guess what? The call drops! So I call back, wait a few minutes, get dropped again.

This company has always been super easy to deal with, but this has me fuming because why in the world did they take my trash can in the first place if three of their people are telling me nobody was supposed to be taking it? Why not bring it back immediately? Or even on the day it was purposefully scheduled to be brought back. Why when my called got dropped, in the middle of you making me hold, would you not just call me back? You had literally just asked me to confirm my info so I know you have my number right in front of you. Seriously, people.

I'm willing to laugh off having my trash can stolen, but now the trash is really piling up. I have two kids in diapers so just.. Yeah, imagine that. My house also backs up to the woods and we've had creatures tear our trash apart before, so I don't want to leave it outside without a bin. Ughhh ",1,Ranting about a normally amazing company,6

I've been dealing with some really severe health issues, and am also visually disabled and don't drive. I'm definitely doing better than I was before, but can sometimes be hit out of nowhere with flareups.

Now, because of my eyes, I can't navigate by bus, so I pretty much get rides from family/friends/neighbors and/or use Uber/Lyft when I really need to go somewhere. So, on Monday I had a pretty important appointment in the afternoon to deal with matters related to my grandma's estate, as she recently passed away. The plan was, I'd take a Lyft to my meeting, then run some errands in the area (pick up my meds, etc.), and then would go to the restaurant next door to have something to eat and my mom could meet me there when she got off work shortly after.

Everything goes according to plan, it's all a pretty good day, and so on, until I get to the restaurant. I order and everything okay, but then start suddenly feeling really sick. So, I text my mom to let her know and ask her to please hurry, and nibble at my food and such while I wait for her. I also pay the check in full with my usual 20% tip and such, but don't really pay much attention because I'm pretty out of it by then.

So, my mom gets there to get me, but even with having taken my meds I need to run off to the bathroom. Now, apparently (I, of course, know none of this until later), in the meantime, my mom glances at the check that's still on the table and notices that it's wrong. The restaurant has early dining specials before 6:00. In fact, these early prices are programmed into the computer that calculates the checks to make it easier on the staff, as we know because we're regulars and on a first-name basis with all the managers. It's only a $2.00 difference, but the waitress had literally done a manual override to charge the full price. So, my mom asks for a glass of wine for herself on a separate check while she waits for me because I'm really sick, and asks the waitress to please fix my check while she's at it.

So, I get back to the table to sip my lemonade for a few while I see if it's safe to get in the car, only to have the waitress come back, hand my mom something, and basically straight up toss a new check into my lap - ""here, you just sign this"" - now, granted, I was pretty out of it, but not so much so as to not remember having already signed a check, so I was pretty confused. I open it up to look, and see the glass of wine on there now. So, I'm just like ""oh, okay, I guess I'm paying for your wine."" My mom looks up startled from what I can now see is her own check ""Wait... what? Let me see that!""

Sure enough, the waitress had fixed the early dine price thing, but when I was too out of it to notice that the first time around and my mom had told her how sick I was, she went ahead and put the glass of wine on my check as well, as well as printing my mom her own check for that same glass of wine, apparently counting on me to just blindly sign it.

My mom literally took both checks directly up to the manager. The full meal and wine and all ended up being zeroed out, because it was all so blatant. So, she turned a 20% tip on two separate checks into no tip and a loss for the restaurant. I'll be surprised if we keep seeing her in there.

TL;DR: Our waitress tries double charging, presumably to get more of a tip, but instead ends up with nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: Wow, this has really blown up in a way I wasn't expecting. Thank you, everyone, for all your concern! I'm trying to keep up with all the comments, and can assure you that even if I don't respond, I will read everything you all have to say. I have been feeling better the last couple days, with no major flare-ups, so hopefully I get a little break from my illness and get to enjoy my weekend. Doctors are still working to find a solid diagnosis and treatment on that side of things so I can go back to living as normal of a life as possible, but I at least have a pretty strong support system behind me in the meantime.

One thing I've learned in life: while there will be a few out there eager to take advantage, the vast majority of people are kind, helpful, and decent. So, yes, while something like this does sting a bit, I can also remember the sheer number of people who have come to my assistance over the years just because I needed help.

I was hoping for a quick meal so fast food it is. After taking my order we were held up at the queue for a good 5 minutes while the cashier was also getting the food from the back. She comes back and tells me she would just bring my order to the table. So I take the nearest table. Minutes pass by again, the queue was now moving and everyone getting their meals while I sat patiently. 

I got up intending to request a follow-up but I saw my order in their food queue so I sat back down. Waited some more, I hear the manager at the back ask if it is for take out. Guess nobody answered her. So my meal was sitting at the table for quite some time now. After this I got up and told one of the servers that my order was literally five feet away from us. So they relay this to the staff handling food, in which she takes the order, ignoring I was standing in front of her and gave it to the cashier who took my order. She says, hey do you have this meal on your queue and I was just standing there thinking I just pointed it out 10 seconds ago. 

As the 5kg cat food and litter I'm carrying is already weighing down on my shoulders, I told the cashier I will just have it to go. I go back to my seat and wait some more. I can still eye my meal sitting on the counter. At this point, I've lost a lot of time already when I needed to be going. 

I approach the counter and asks to just cancel my order. In which suddenly she now hands me my takeout package. I'm annoyed but I feel too defeated and just took it and left. Apparently she reserved my order to the customer behind me and instead made me a new one. 

I'm aware they already are underpaid and overworked but I am still slightly annoyed by the whole thing. I regret muttering under my breath when they passed my order around despite standing in front of them and instead of asking for the receipt to confirm it is mine. 

I thought about being petty and insist on canceling it causing more time delayed. But I just move on from this situation making it worse for both of us.

I'm probably more annoyed at the manager who was supposed to follow through the flow of their ticketing and lest just an order sit there as the rest was moving. 

IDK what I should have done better in this situation. Maybe I should have been more assertive or something. Sigh.",1,My order was passed around til I was forced to cancel my order,29
624,MK_Terry,0,t3_alsrcu,23,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/alsrcu/i_saw_it_on_clearance/,"Before starting I have a little background info.  I used to be on the customer service of a clothing brand, I'll call it the suit store (I'm working customer service something else now but that's unrelated), they have stores all around the country.  My main job was to answer questions, place orders, fix issues when they're having issues with the website, IE the website breaks and it won't let them remove product from their cart.  All simple stuff usually.

&amp;#x200B;

So this man calls in and says he saw a coat on the clearance rack in a store for $50.  I pull up the product on the website and what do I find?  It's on sale for $600.  I tell him that I have to do a little more research before I can honor that kind of discount, so I ask him for a little more information and get out of him 2 locations he had visited.

I call the one store and they tell me that he had indeed come into the store and had asked about the stock of said product, and they had given him a couple locations where it was in stock.  (We have a system on our end that lets us check the current stock of stores that's supposedly updated every 5 minutes.)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that doesn't prove anything so far, they didn't mention anything about clearance prices even after I asked specifically about it.

So I called the 2nd store and ask them about the customer, and they tell me the most 'surprising' thing.  The product is in fact, not on sale, and had somehow gotten onto the clearance rack, of which they don't know how.  The customer had asked them to honor the sale price in his size but they said they couldn't because it isn't on sale.

&amp;#x200B;

So imagine right now taking an hour looking into the notes, calling the stores, prying information out of him, then add another 15 minutes of 'I'm sorry I can't honor 95% off.' (It was on sale for $400 or something but normally the product was in the $600 range.  Things can move from on sale and onto clearance and be up to 90% off at times.)

&amp;#x200B;

So this person hangs up on me and I spend the next 15 minutes organizing my notes and clarifying everything I said and did to cover my ass.

And then I pull up his profile again and see a new note of a call in.  How interesting.

The literal next rep gave the guy a 95% discount on a product, but no not even that, they didn't charge the requested $50, they had him pay $35, because they don't understand the system and fucked up.  (If something is on sale for $60 when it's normally $100, and you manually set a price, the manual price you set is then reduced by the 40% so if you set it at $40, then in this example, it'd reduce it to $24 instead.

So essentially they got a person who was either new or the person didn't want to deal with it.

I read the notes so basically the customer said I was a lying PoS, oh and to top it off he bought 2 of them for the insane 95% off price.

I don't know how to put it but I wanted to cry I was so mad.  So many 'customers' are just leeches getting free stuff and it upsets me, but the company didn't seem to care.  I wish these sorts of things weren't as common as they actually are, I'm not sure how they remain in business.  (Like someone will call in and I'll view their cart and they already have a 70% discount applied, so I know they know our code when none of our reps applied it for them.  It's one of our system codes that we as customer service are authorized to use but never give out.  I have that thing memorized by heart since I used it so often for 10% - 20% off courtesy deals.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I spent an hour verifying a claim a customer made and denied the customer's request, and the customer called back in and got an undeserved 95% off discount.

I just tried posting this but my alternate name for the restaurant this happened in was too close to the actual name, changed in this new post :)

**TLDR: Tried to do a good deed and buy grieving partner some comfort food. Order is messed up repeatedly, accidentally drive off without food, went back to collect it only to find it's still wrong by the time I get home.**

Last night my partner found out his grandma passed away. She'd been unwell for a while but it still somewhat came out of nowhere. I picked up his favourite pizzas for dinner, talked things over with him, and generally tried to be supportive.

This morning he was understandably still upset, so I decided to do something nice and go get us breakfast while he had a sleep in. Asked him what he wanted and drove 6mins away to our local Burger Place. Drive through was pretty busy, so I stuck on my podcast and waited my turn. Staff Members will be S1, S2, S3, S4 &amp; S5. I will be M.

S1: (through ordering speaker) Welcome to Burger Place, place your order when ready.

M: Hi, can I please get a large burger meal with no pickles and a vanilla coke, 3 sausage meat patties, two hashbrowns and a large vanilla coke?

S1: So that's a large burger meal with a vanilla, three sausage &amp; egg muffins -

M: No sorry, just the sausage meat patties on their own, not in muffins.

S1: No problems I'll fix that up. Drive through when you're ready.

**I drive up to the next window to pay. I'm also now the last car, no more behind me.**

S1: So that's a large burger meal with a vanilla, and you wanted sausage and egg muffins only sausage?

M: No sorry, just the sausage patties on their own. No muffin or anything just the meat.

S1: Oops! Just one sec!

**She closes the window, leaves for a while and comes back. This happens a lot when I order these because lots of staff don't know how to put it through so they have to ask. I order them every Sunday from a store near my work so i know it's definitely an option, even though I've many times had staff tell me it's not. So I just wait patiently. She returns, presses some buttons and I pay, asking for a receipt, intending to check it in case it doesn't go through right. I drive to the next window.**

S2: Have you got your two drinks yet?

M: Not yet.

S2: Do you need a cup tray for the two?

M: No I'm fine thank you.

S2 hands me the first drink and it doesn't look right at all.

S2: Thats the vanilla shake.

M: I didn't order a vanilla shake, just two vanilla cokes.

S2: So sorry, let me fix that!

**She leaves and I decide to check the receipt. Not only have they charged me for two vanilla shakes, but they also charged me a lot more for the sausage patties than they should have. They are normally 90c each, these came through at $7.80 for 3. She returns to the window.**

M: Really sorry, but the lady has put this through wrong. I asked for two vanilla cokes not shakes, and the meat patties have gone through as something else wrong too. They should be 90c each.

**S3 approaches, seeing something going on. I repeat this to her (she seems like a manager) and she apologises and leaves to refund and reprocess my order. Still trying to be patient, these things happen. She returns with my money and S4 behind her with drinks. S3 leaves.**

S4: Sorry about the mix up. Here's your drinks. This one is the coke, and this one-

M: They should both be vanilla cokes, not regular cokes.

S4: Sorry! Let me fix that!

**I'm now getting very annoyed and trying my best not to show it. I'm also getting stressed because my partner is still at home alone and he's messaging me asking when I'll be back. S4 returns and gives me my drinks.**

S4: Sorry again, have a great day!

**She closes the window and walks away. This part is actually my fault. I heard the ""have a great day"" and just instinctively left. Drove all the way home until I looked over at my passenger side and realised my mistake. FFS. I drive all the way back. This time, the drive through is empty so I just drive all the way through to the last window and wait until someone walks past.**

M: Excuse me, I accidentally drove through and forgot my food earlier. It was the large burger meal with no pickles, 3 sausage meat patties and two hashbrowns.

S5: No problem, let me go sort it out for you.

**She leaves and appears less than 20 seconds later after speaking to S3 who I can see off to the side. She has a bag with her which, judging by the time she was gone, tells me it's my original order. Thinking it may now be a little cold, I figured I would just reheat when I get home, not their fault I drove off. No biggie.**

S5: Here's your food, have a nice day.

**I drive off, get home, and my partner's first reaction was ""You've been gone for 45 minutes? Everything ok?"" I told him the whole story, he laughed about it and thanked me for going. I was happy I at least managed to make him smile, and we sit down to eat the slightly less than warm food.**

Five years ago, my husband and I wanted a Doberman. We looked at breeders in the area after discovering none of the shelters had puppies (they were all older and we desperately wanted a puppy to grow up with our newborn son) and found one we loved! We visited the breeder, petted mama dog since she was a sweetie, and this little black and brown bundle tried to climb my leg.. We were in love. That's how we got Baron. 

Well, when we brought Baron home, there were some issues. He was getting sick from both ends. We tried different food, no change. We took his little butt right to the vet. We get there, tell them about the sickness and a couple other symptoms, and are immediately isolated in a room. Our puppy is on the table looking miserable, a pair of nurses in full gown/glove/mask gear come in to take some blood and other things. They tell us he might have parvo, but it's ok, they're testing for other things, as well. 

We sat in there for what felt like forever since we were worried about our poor puppy (our son was in the NICU due to premature birth, so this was extra stressful). Finally, a nurse comes in - no gown, gloves, or mask. 

""It's not parvo!"" She exclaimed with the biggest smile, arms wide open to hug, cuddle, and kiss little Baron, who was happy to reciprocate. It was like a battle cry, three more people following her in and loving on our sweet boy. It just shattered the tension in the room. They cooed over his pretty eyes and his floppy ears. I might have happy cried a little.

So last December I decided I wanted to upgrade my phone since I had a free upgrade with my cell provider. I went into the mall with my mom to my providers store and told them that I wanted to upgrade to just the iPhone 6s since I can’t part with the headphone jack quite yet. Enter pushy sales guy (PS). 

PS: *typing my info into the computer* so with your free upgrade you can actually go up to the iPhone 7 instead of just the 6s. Do you want to do that?

Me: No thanks, I’m fine with the 6s, I like having the headphone jack so I don’t have to fuss around with the stupid dongles. 

PS: are you sure? The 7 is a lot better. 

Me: ...yes I’m sure, I want a 6s. 

PS: I think you want the 7. 

Me: no really I want a 6s, please. (Very confused and frustrated at this point). 

At this point PS goes into the back to grab my new phone. He comes out with a Space Grey model. 

Me: oh do you have a gold or rose gold one? I really like those colours better. 

PS: no we only have this in the grey colour  

And now I glance at the box and realize he’s starting to set up a f***ing iPhone 7. 

Me: oh sorry I said an iPhone 6s, that’s a 7 isn’t it? 

PS: yeah it is, trust me it’s a better phone. 
 
Now my mom steps in and says maybe we should check out another stores prices on new phones since obviously they don’t have a 6s here. I think PS *finally* gets the hint that I do NOT want a 7 and goes to the back and finds a rose gold 6s, like I wanted. 
Now, I am veeeery particular about my phone settings and in general I prefer doing things like setting up new devices myself. I haven’t been diagnosed with ocd but I strongly suspect I have at least a mild form of it (I do have an appointment to look into this soon too). So while this next part might seem like a minor annoyance to you, it seriously upset me. 
PS takes the phone out and starts going through all the set up stuff on the phone, which the sales people haven’t done before when I’ve upgraded in the past. They usually just pop my SIM card in and let me go. 

Me: oh I can set all that up at home. 

PS: nah it’s fine I got it. 

Me: no really please I’d like to do it. 

PS: I’m almost done it’s fine. 

Now I’m standing there starting to get jittery and shake a little bit watching him just fly through the settings and hit “no” or “skip” on everything knowing that there’s some stuff in the settings I do want on or have to adjust to my liking. Eventually he finishes “setting up” my phone and we leave, and I’m so frustrated I factory reset the phone right in the store and took it home and re did it all myself. 
I just couldn’t believe how rude he was not listening to *anything* I said. I’m locked into my contract for another year after my upgrade but that experience was enough to make me not want to continue using this provider once my contract is up. 

TLDR; pushy salesman insisted on giving me a phone I explicitly said I didn’t want, going so far as to start going through with the sale of it hoping I wouldn’t notice it was the wrong phone.

It was my roommate’s birthday (let’s call him Fred), so a bunch of us took him out for dinner at a western-style steakhouse. It was a big place with great food, with  life-sized plastic cows and a huge green neon cactus out front. A local institution, one of those quirky places that went out of business a couple of decades ago. I’d made a reservation for the ten of us.

They seated us in a side area that was otherwise empty. The meal went well, and everyone was happy. Then we got the bill. We covered Fred, of course, but everyone else was paying for their own meal. It was a single check, so everyone looked over the bill and put in what they owed. I put it all together and made sure that there was a good big tip. And then we waited.

And waited.

And waited.

The waitress had disappeared. **All** the waitresses had disappeared. We were alone in that side room, and there was nobody in sight. Half an hour passed. Everybody got sick of waiting, so it was decided that we’d leave the money on the table and go. People got up and started heading towards the cars.

\[Just to be clear, this was NOT one of those places where you pay at a cash register. The waitresses brought your bill, took the money, and brought change.\]

I began to feel nervous. I was uncomfortable just leaving the cash on the table; what if somebody stole it? But everyone was leaving, and I didn’t have a ride of my own. I’d come with Fred and a couple of other friends. I was pretty sure they wouldn’t leave without me, but it didn’t seem impossible that they might think I’d hitched a ride with other friends. We were all going back to my place for cake.

This was prior to the days of cell phones, or at least prior to the day that any of **us** had a cell phone. So I had no way to call anyone. I definitely felt panic when I saw the last of my friends turn the corner towards the doors.

What could I do? I left the cash on the table with the bill, and weighed them down with a small ketchup bottle. Taking one more helpless look around for a waiter or *anybody* (no luck), I headed towards the door. Didn’t see a waitress or anyone connected with the restaurant the whole way out. Once outside, I was relieved to see that my friends were waiting for me in the distance.

As I headed towards them, I noticed a small waitress (not ours) looking out from a glass side door. Just as I saw her, she gave a sudden jump and dashed out of sight. A few seconds later our waitress came charging out that door at me like a buffalo. Grabbing the front of my coat, she yelled:

“If you don’t pay your bill they’ll take it out of **my** paycheck!”

“But I *paid* it!” I protested. “I left the money on the table!”

“**Where?!?**”

“Under a ketchup bottle!”

“Come with me while I check,” she said grimly, and her tone made it clear that this was no request; it was an order. She dragged me into the side door.

Now, I didn’t see what happened inside right after I had left the restaurant. But I can only guess that less than five seconds after I went out the door, she got to our table. Seeing nobody there, she must have screamed something like this:

“Oh my **GOD**! The fat bald red-bearded guy stiffed me for more than a **hundred bucks**!”

And she must have had a powerful set of lungs, for such a small woman. As she dragged me through the entire length of the restaurant in a state of shock, **everyone** was staring and commenting. Men, women, children, all staring and saying:

“They caught him!”

“Somebody should call the cops.”

“What a sleazebag!”

“Look, they caught him!”

As we passed the kitchen, even the dishwashers were leaning out the door and staring, calling out comments as well. They were speaking Chinese, I think, so I didn’t understand them. But from the tone, I was pretty sure that they were making the same comments as everyone else. The whole place was excited to see swift justice carried out - on me.

As we got to the entrance of the side room, the hostess - a stout middle-aged woman with hair dyed the color of brass and a face to match - came bustling up. In her wake was a nervous-looking security guard in uniform. The guy had a hand on his gun.

On. His. Gun. Things were getting very surreal, very fast. This would be a a really embarrassing way to die.

“There!” I said desperately, pointing at the money on the table, relieved to see that it hadn’t been stolen. The waitress grabbed and counted it.

“He left it on the table!” she announced. I heard the audience all around passing that along, murmuring back into the far reaches of the restaurant. The security guard took his hand off his gun.

Hi yall! So, this past summer, my boyfriend and I road tripped from our state on the east coast out to the west coast. After one long day of driving, we end up in a small city in a southwestern state. We check into the hotel around 9:00pm. We were tired and hungry, but a lot of restaurants were closing, and we were a bit sick of fast food at this point. I do a quick Google search and find a wine bar that servers a nice menu open til 11:00. Sweet. 

So we haul ourselves down. It's a nice little bar in sort of a town square with a lot of people sitting on the patio because it was a nice warm night. There was also some kind of event going on in the square area. Super cool. 

So, there was no host outside. The place was kind of on a corner, and the outside walls were windows, so we could see completely inside. The only employees we were were the bartender inside and the server outside. There were maybe six tables seated outside and inside looked empty. We go in, and the very friendly bartender greets us and gives us menus. We ask if it would be possible to sit outside, and she said of course and told us to sit at any open tables. 

We take our seats and the server comes over. He introduces himself and asks if the host sat us. We apologized and stated that we didn't see a host but the bartender had said to sit anywhere. He was a friendly dude. We order drinks, I order a glass of wine and my boyfriend orders some drink with whiskey (sort of important). Waiter checks our ID'S and we have an ENTIRE conversation about how were from this state on the east coast, we chat about our road trip, he tells us we have to get up to San Fran because it's amazing and he lived there for like two months or something. Very cool. 

So we get our drinks and order. The menu was different than the online one so they didn't have what I originally wanted, but no big deal. I got a salad, boyfriend got a turkey sandwich. Literally nothing that involved cooking. But it just.. Never came. Other tables were leaving. Like I'm talking 45 minutes. I work in the service industry. I've been a server for over five years. I get it. Things happen, kitchens mess up. Whatever. We're just enjoying the drinks and weather. 

Eventually it's 10:00. We've been there for almost an hour. Another table sits next to us, and the nice bartender comes out to serve them. She tells them the kitchens about to close (boyfriend and I shoot looks at each other), but if they order now she can get stuff in for them. Some girl orders the salad I got, and bartender tells her they are out of the two main ingredients (I wouldve liked to know that because that left me with spinach and walnuts and that is it).  

Waiter eventually comes back with a weird look on his face. He states at us for a second and just goes ""... You guys ordered food."" And we're just like... Yes. We did. And he just forgot! So he apologizes and says he's been working a twelve hour shift (get it, it happens), asks if we still want the food. We say yes. He brings me another glass of wine (which he didn't charge for, but I think he just forgot to ring it in honestly), and he tells my boyfriend he's going to make him an awesome drink on the house. He comes back with a very fruity vodka drink. Admittedly, it was delicious. But it was nothing close to the whiskey he had previously been drinking. We assumed because he was drinking vodka behind the bar. 

Food comes eventually. We eat and he drops off the bill and just NEVER comes back. We're seated by the big wall/window so we can literally seem him inside behind the bar. 

After twenty minutes, I go in. He looks at me and says ""didn't you already pay?"" And I'm like uh, no. So he apologizes again, takes my card, and starts chatting with me. Then he asks where I'm from.. And I say the state I'm from.. And we begin having the SAME EXACT road trip/gotta go to San Fran conversation again. I thought I was dreaming.

Anyway. I ended up tipping him for pure entertainment purposes. Granted, not nearly as much as it would've been if he was competent. Yeah, I couldve called and complained to someone, but I figure a guy like that is probably not going to las long anyway, or ownership doesn't care. But yeah! My favorite service story!

TL;DR after essentially continuously forgetting about us for two hours, our probably drunk server continues to have the same conversation multiple times. ",1,The waiter that forgets,60

Basically my whole family was out of the house for the day. Shopping, doctor's appointments, etc. While me, my father and my sister went straight home, my mom got us Unnamed Fast Food Chain as a surprise.

This led to her coming home about 20 minutes later than she should have. I'm kind of picky about what food I eat in the same mouthful (thanks, autism) so I usually get a cheeseburger with only cheese and meat. Either the person taking our order or the one cooking didn't understand, so my mother had to send it back twice. I kind of feel bad for the people working for dealing with it and whoever else was getting food. She also got a triple [food] for my dad, which the person interpreted as three of the [foods], instead of a [food] with three patties. 

She went home after the third try, figuring that it was enough. I accidentally took my father's cheeseburger, and upon taking one bite, I immediately spit it out. The meat was raw. This has actually happened before at this particular place, but thankfully, both times it only affected one burger. Mine was a little pink, both times, but not absolutely raw.

Over the last 5mo a certain patient has visited me for treatment. At times this person is wearing clothes that clearly have not been washed in a very long time. There are neck collar stains darker than the dark orange fabric. When the patient leaves, I need to swap out their chair for a new one and spray deodorizer in the room and stay out of there for 20min. The next patient almost always complains about the stink in the waiting room. 

The patient has some mental health conditions which they are being treated for by another party. I will be seeking the doctors opinion of a review. 

Today, the patient attends wearing the same shirt they were wearing 5mo ago which had perhap a years worth of soil. I recall there has been one shirt swap out over the 5 visits, but this shirt has the same details and odour I recalled from many months ago.

There is the expected level of bargaining which quickly turns to acceptance from the patient there should be some change. I see them again next week.

Short story that I hope you'll enjoy !


Last time I went to an restaurant with a friend. The restaurant looked pretty full and while we were waiting at the frontdesk, a guy (the owner, I assumed) asked us :

Us : yes

O : and you haven't booked a table ?

Us : No

O : WRONG ! 

He said it exactly like Trump would, except it wasn't in an English speaking country, so it was clearly not a joke.

638,Unicorneggskt,0,t3_al9h91,6,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/al9h91/you_need_to_make_an_appointment_to_bring_in_your/,"So... As you may infer from the title this is going to be a sort of sad story. It’s not that fresh either since this happened on specifically December 26th and it’s taken me a while to get around to posting it because it was just too frustrating to deal with. 

So almost 2yrs algo I moved from the west side of one my state’s counties to the east side. At the time I had 2 dogs. One being 14 at the time and the other being 3. We had a vet that we really liked and had had for years since we got the 14yr old dog when he was 1yr old. They recommended a different veterinary clinic for us that was part of the same group. I’m going to refer to them as The Ranch. 

So The Ranch is a little frustrating to deal with. The younger of the two dogs has a skin allergy and needs to go in monthly to get an allergy shot so he doesn’t bite himself to oblivion. (This is the start of the troubles with them btw) You’re required to schedule an appointment with the vet to get the allergy shot. No problem we’ve done this with the other clinic. But this clinic is somehow always busy. Always full. Can never schedule an appointment to get an allergy shot that takes no more than 15min to inject. Apparently they only have 1 tech at this really busy vet? This is the first instance of The Ranch being a problem. 

Fast forward a year we’ve been having on and off problems with scheduling with them and we’re getting pretty frustrated at this point. The youngest now being 4yrs old has gotten into something and thrown up. It’s pretty dark red and could be blood we’re not sure exactly what he’s gotten into so we call that vet to see if we can immediately bring him in. They classify it not an emergency since I can’t confirm if it’s blood or not, inform me that they close in 15min and will not stay open to try to see him and I’m better off waiting it out or calling somewhere else. Thanks The Ranch, so helpful as always. I ended up taking him to his now regular vet #1 Pet Vet Ever (not the real name). 

Fast forward another year to December 26th. My elder dog is now 16yrs old and has glaucoma and shaky old man legs. He’s been moping around and not eating anything since the 23rd and we were trying to figure out when to take him to The Ranch because of this but they were closed because of the holidays. My mom ended up staying home from work to watch him and he seems to go into an unconscious state and breathing really heavily and he throws up. She calls me at work and I’m allowed to go home to deal with this. She’s crying and scared that we’re going to lose him. She tells me she called The Ranch and she said we’d have to schedule an appointment to put him down, which is what we planned on doing at this point because we don’t think there’s anything else we can do for him. They also said the only available appointment would be 4 days from then. 

I end up calling #1 Best Vet Ever and they’re really nice and supportive and tell us we’ll never have to call to schedule to put a dog down because they understand the situation is very delicate and thought out and a sensitive time. We end up driving him there and he unfortunately died on the way over. The folks at #1 Best Vet Ever were very kind to us and very helpful in that time. 

I will never recommend The Ranch to anyone. The scheduling thing is a tremendous problem and I don’t understand why you would need to schedule an appointment for that. 

For context, the original vet we went to that was a sister vet to The Ranch did not require us to schedule an appointment to put down the 16yr old’s brother when he was dying of hay fever at 13yrs. They also did not require an appointment when another one of our dogs was attacked by a coyote and we needed to have him cremated. That’s why my mom and I were so frustrated with The Ranch. They also never had the glaucoma or shaky legs medication ready when we needed to refill them even though we set up auto refills. 

TL/DR: Sister vet of former vet known as The Ranch has terrible scheduling from allergy shots to putting down a dog. They tell us we have to schedule an appointment to put down our 16yr old dying dog would be 4 days from whence we called them. We ended up going to a different vet, #1 Best Vet Ever and they did not require an appointment and were super kind",1,You need to make an appointment to bring in your dying dog,30

So my dad picked me up last night from uni. Just as we were making the turn into the highway, he told me he wanted to stop by this big hardware center before heading home. Apparently, he wants to return the water heater he bought the other day because it had defects and a bunch of other problems involving confusing wiring color codes and an absence of English translations in the assembly diagram that came with it. He's been doing DIY repairs on our eletricity lines and water pipes the entire week and he is understandably pissed with how his purchase went down given all the money and energy he's spent on this. I still, however, feel ashamed of how he behaved when we arrived at the place. He was immediately approached by one of the staff when we entered their store. Pretty friendly guy. Dad told him he wanted to return his item and he took us to the customer service representative. Upon hearing his brief complaint, the CS rep informed us that they unfortunately do not allow refunds and may only replace his item with another model of the same value. My dad was livid upon hearing this. Dad told them he's not interested with the other items because last time he checked, it was the best product for that value. He wasn't interested on getting the same model either because of the weird wiring color code it had and its lack of an English installation manual. He had this ""WTH"" scowl on his face and I knew I had to step in. They informed us they could instead arrange a support/assistance appointment with the company that sells that brand of item on our behalf. I asked when will this be available and gestured to my dad to just stay calm. The rep was just telling us about how they would arrange for the support guy to come in as conveniently soon as possible when my dad rudely cut them off. He started swearing about how he doesn't have time for that (he's really busy) and he was acting like... y'know... typical Karen swearing all circles of hell. Thankfully, the reps tactfully told him to calm down and they will sort his issue with the item. They gave him their contact number and assured him they will also reach out to him when they finally sort things out. He eased up in the end and we went home hopeful. I'm just so embarassed about how he acted towards those people that night so I'm posting this. He's usually nice and easy-going so this experience felt really new to me.

We were out doing errands and we both got hungry. She suffers from  Diverticulitis which basically means she can’t eat any kind of small seeds or nuts. This often causes problems when we go out to eat. Well when deciding what to eat we thought a popular burger joint, because well I figured a burger wouldn’t have seeds in it. I order my burger but notice that the buns do have seeds on them. I ask the manager if there are any seedless buns and he informs me that no, they only have seeded buns. So my grandma orders a grilled cheese assuming it would just be on some white bread. 

We receive our food and we see that they also make the grilled cheeses with the hamburger buns. I go ask the manager to ask if there’s anything that can be done and provide some more information on her condition  and he informs me that the only bread they have has sesame seeds and that he apologizes. 

I sit down to quickly eat my burger so that I can take my grandma somewhere else to eat. The manager comes to our  table as i’m getting close to finishing my food. He looks at us with a smile saying “I figured it out”. We unwrap the food he brought us and it was a grilled cheese with two flattened hot dog buns on either side. No sesame seeds. 

The fact that this manager continued to think of a way to help us and was considerate of a condition my grandma had was heartwarming. Most places write her off as someone who just doesn’t like sesame seeds of who doesn’t like whatever the thing is that she can’t eat, but he actually attempted to take care of us.

Okay, before anybody hates me, let me give some backstory. I was in a major accident 2ish years ago that left me disabled. Spine damage, nerve damage, one surgery down two more to go, a brain injury...the works. I had to move in with my parents. Last Friday was literally the first time I have bathed all by myself since 2016...my mother has had to help me (especially washing hair, ugh, you have no idea how tempted I’ve been to just chop that shit off to a pixie!). For reference, I’m pushing 30 years old. I’ve lost pretty much everything: my job, my friends, my independence, all of it—and traded it for a life of constant doctor visits (seriously, I have a doctor for every body part now: neurologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, orthopedist, even oncologist at one point! It’s nuts) and picking out cool stickers for my cane. 

As I’m sure you can imagine, I’ve become extremely depressed. 

One silver lining to all of this though has been makeup. I’ve learned to do my own makeup without moving my bad arm. Doing my mom’s makeup has helped me get some strength back in my arm and hand, so I’m not as shaky as I once was. Watching YouTube and getting new makeup when it’s still hot has made me feel like I’m part of a community in some small way...like I kinda have friends again. Makeup and my dog (who has almost completed his training to be a therapy/service dog!) have been my two biggest sources of happiness and “escape” from this reality. 

SO. 

For Christmas and my birthday (close together) my parents wanted to get me some makeup. I gave them a list of a bunch of things and basically said “anything on this list is awesome,” and gave them my Ulta card so I could earn the points. I wasn’t expecting much cause, ya know, medical bills. Instead they brought back quite a bit of stuff, and it was then given to me with a note saying “pick out $X and we’ll return the rest.” Okay cool! I can’t really get out of the house and go to Ulta myself, so they brought a little of it to me. (Not a crazy amount, just like: new abh palette vs new too faced palette.) I thought it was sweet. 

I picked out my items and we packaged up the rest to go back to Ulta. The next day my mom gets a call that there has been a family emergency out of state. I can’t go because I’m not allowed to travel, so we decide to ship the box back to Ulta instead of dealing with the in-store hassle while trying to get to family. I put a note in the box telling them that all the makeup was untouched and unused. A neighbor agrees to come by every day and check on me/help me live. This all happened on Dec 31, three weeks before the 60 day deadline. 

Guess what shows up on my doorstep on Jan 2. 

**THE DAMN ULTA BOX.**

For some insane reason, someone at the post office decided to *switch* the “to” and “from” addresses. So I mailed myself a box of unwanted makeup for $20. Awesome. 

I was able to catch the mail lady the next day and explained to her what was going on. On the box, in my handwriting, it says very clearly that it was TO Ulta FROM me. Why would I mail myself a heavy box?? She rolled her eyes, said “oh god, I know who did this. I’ll take care of it.” took the box and left. It sounded like this wasn’t the first time it has happened. The box never came back to me so I assumed it had sailed safely to its destination. 

Last Friday I got an email from Ulta telling me that they were denying my refund because it didn’t arrive within the 60 days. Um, what? I sent the box almost a month ago, what do you mean? They said that they didn’t get it until January 22... **two days** after the 60 day mark. 
 
Wat. 

I was speechless. First of all, how did it take *three weeks* to get there? I don’t live that far away from the warehouse it was being shipped it...it’s not like it had to go overseas. Second, it’s two days guys. TWO DAYS. I understand two years late but two *days*??? Cmon. 

I emailed him back my receipt from usps with the tracking number and the date showing him that I mailed the package wayyyy before the deadline. I explained to him the post office hiccup. I was told that I was being transferred to a supervisor because the front line customer service people didn’t have the ability to change it. Okay cool. 

The supervisor was so cold and uncaring that I just started crying. I was very happy the conversation was over email at that point. I’ve been nice throughout this entire thing because I know the CS people are just doing their jobs, but all I wanted to do in that moment was scream. It was $300. That $300 is three infusions. That $300 is a third of a neck injection. That $300 is food, is gas, is a car payment. I didn’t (don’t!) *want* my parents to spend that amount of money on me for makeup, and like I said earlier, they never intended to—they just didn’t know what I would like the most or what’s “in” right now and was trying to give me a fun “shopping day” birthday. I couldn’t bear the thought of them losing that money, especially over something as stupid as post office fuckery and two goddamn days. 

I emailed the supervisor back while I was still very emotional and basically spilled my guts. I told him about being disabled and makeup becoming my joy, which is something I *never* drop because I don’t want to sound like those assholes on r/choosingbeggars who are always a ~*single mom*~ who’s *disabled* and can’t drive and has *four kids* who she already *promised* could have your Xbox and now they’re **crying** cause you said no so you should give it to her for **free.** I also ended up typing the infamous, “I don’t think I’ll be shopping with you again.” I was just so SAD and MAD and...and bewildered, honestly! I’ve worked customer service before. I’ve worked retail. I’ve even been a manager and run my own little franchise before my accident. So I *know* that “there’s nothing we can do because it’s two days over the limit” is a fucking lie. There’s *always* something you can do. And to be self-righteous and selfish, I personally feel like with all the postal service fuckery this is a special situation. Like I said earlier, it’s not like I was deliberately trying to send it late. I was three whole weeks early. 

^(Which, also, I would be lying if I said it hadn’t crossed my mind that they may have deliberately held it there or have a big giant pile that someone is not going through in a timely manner or something because that package was sent priority and set to be delivered *the next day*. Now you gonna tell me it took the whole three weeks? Naw...I don’t think I buy that. But that’s just my little conspiracy theory.)

Sooooo yeah. I guess I kinda turned into a Karen. I was nice about it at least? We’ll see what the supervisor says when he emails me back.

So I've seen so many stories on reddit about customers being morons and thought I'd share a happy story of mine.

Me, my brother, and 3 of our cousins went to a restaurant to eat. We ordered some chicken sandwiches and fries sandwiches. When the order came out we started eating as usual but then noticed (we didn't bite into it) that one of the chicken sandwiches was a fries sandwich.

As any sensible human being would do we told the cook and he immediately apologized and made us a chicken sandwich (mind you it was busy as hell so him doing that was already nice enough).

You are supposed to pay while ordering at that restaurant so when he gave us the sandwich we gave him the fries sandwich, he just told us we could keep it. We thought ""ok, he is busy let's eat it and pay for it while leaving.""

Whem we went to leave the guy just didn't accept the money, he just told us to have a nice day and that we came have the sandwich for free.

Not wanting to walk the five or so blocks, we took a taxi to the restaurant. With tip, it cost $6. Not a problem. (Plus, we were running late for our reservation, and I called and they said they would hold our table.  My wife was wearing boots with heels, and it was cold out.  She didn't want to walk, plus we planned to take a taxi there and back.)

Dinner was wonderful. During the meal, the manager stopped by our table and asked how things were, and we told him how great the food and service was.

As we were leaving, we stopped by the front desk to ask what was the easiest way to get a taxi back to our hotel. The manager was standing beside the hostess when I asked. I figured they had a taxi on speed dial for patrons who asked.  I thought the hostess would order us a taxi, and we'd be on our way.

The manager said, ""Just get an Uber."" He pulled out his phone and about thirty seconds later said, ""An Uber's on its way. Don't worry about the fare or the tip, they're both on us. And it's a Mercedes.""

This floored us. We didn't expect that AT ALL. We just wanted them to call us a cab.

The manager even walked out with us to wait on the sidewalk and tracked the Uber's position with his phone.

We made small talk about our little vacation away from the kids, and how dinner was, and how great our waiter was, until the Uber arrived.

That was so nice of the manager. Is this a common thing? We only eat at any of the three locations of this steak house maybe once a year, but always just drive our own car, so I don't know if it's normal for them to do this.

In any case, it was a really nice ending to our dinner.   The manager, who I'm sure was a busy man, took the time out to call us a ride and wait with us.",1,The manager of a steak house my wife and I went to did the nicest thing for us. Another feel-good story.,1227

 The lady behind the counter began telling us that she was expecting more stock etc in the next coming weeks and she'd hope to see us again, i told her thanks very much and we'd definitely be back.

I told her I was angry with myself for not calling her out on her rudeness. I went back into the shop and told her I didn't appreciate her thinking I was pregnant, that I actually found it to be quite rude and that in future unless someone mentioned it to her first or they were appeared as though they were about to go into labour that she shouldn't say anything to anyone about them being pregnant.  Turns out she thought I'd come into find baby patterns or something because 'thats all young people are doing in wool shops'

A couple of months ago, my husband and I went away for the weekend and planned to go to a well known theme park.  We arrived in town Thursday afternoon, planning to spend Friday and Saturday at the theme park and return home on Sunday.  We purchased two rather expensive two day passes well ahead of time, and everything was in place when we arrived on Thursday.  

Friday morning, I woke up feeling a little tickle in my throat but otherwise okay.  We arrived at the park and three hours later, I started feeling terrible.  Feeling like a truck hit me and not wanting to spread germs, we left the park right away.   As it turns out, I came down with the full blown flu.  I spent all evening and the entire next few days sick in bed. Per the theme park's policy, the tickets expire seven days after the first ticket is used.  Since we had to travel home, I knew it was going to be a total waste.  

I checked online, and the theme park's policy clearly states the tickets have to be used within 7 days of each other, no exceptions, no refunds, no exchanges, nothing.  Figuring I had nothing to lose, I sent them an email explaining the situation.  Given it was their policy, I fully expected them to write back saying something like, ""We are sorry you were ill, but our policy clearly states the tickets cannot be refunded or exchanged, blah blah blah"".  The next day, I was shocked to see they wrote back and offered me 2 complimentary two day passes to use anytime in the future.  I was honestly extremely surprised by this!

This story is not mine but my mum's, however it still pisses me off to this day. 

A little background info. My mum has many illnesses and from this allergies. One of them is caffine, if she has caffine it could kill her. This is important and for the most part baristas respect that. 

One morning she goes and treats herself to a decaf caramel latte. (I won't say which place but it serves food daily with a cafe attached.) My mum loves coffee also has and when she developed this severe allergy she just switched to decaf. She was not giving up coffee. 

She takes a sip of her coffee and as she's about to start her car it hits her. It has caffine in it. Spits the coffee back out and checks her receipt. Sure enough it says decaf with allergy written next to it. 

At this point she's storming back in there with her receipt and cup of poison. Right back to the barista counter and demands to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and asks what's the problem. 

M=manager, Mum=mum, B=barista, RC= random customer. 

(Paraphasing because I wasn't there)

Mum: This coffee has caffine in it. I'm deathly allergic to caffine. (Shows receipt) 

M: I'm so sorry for the mistake! Let me refund you and get you a new coffee. (In the process of refunding and telling the barista to be more careful RC wanders up) 

RC: I would like to speak to the manager this coffee has caffine in it and I ordered decaf. 

M: :O (turns to barista says something my mum can't hear) 

B: That's not fair! Who comes to a coffee shop and orders decaf! It's too much work to switch between. 

Turns out this B never made decaf coffees. Ever. Didn't care what the customer ordered just made them all caffeinated. M is pissed, apparently they have had complaints before but B was new so they gave her leeway. 

M tries to explain to B that people (my mum) have allergies and could have been seriously hurt or died because of her actions. B refuses to believe someone could be allergic to caffine to the point of death. 

In the end B was fired she left kicking, screaming and crying. M couldn't apologise enough. ",1,Attempted Murder,114

We looked on the Maps app and found an Italian restaurant which had good ratings (I realized it would probably be kinda pricey but I wanted to treat her).

Once we get there they give us menus and all that normal stuff. The waitress has a great attitude and doesn’t seem to mind the fact that my girlfriend had to talk to her in English (I live in a non-english speaking country). We look at the menus she gave us and sadly realized that there was no vegan option (something I was kind of prepared for).

I decided to ask the waitress about the menu and if there was any way to change a dish in order for my girlfriend to be able to eat it. She started going through the menu suggesting things that might work and once we came to a conclusion she told us she’d go and check with the chef if it would work.

This is where the part that surprised me came. The chef herself came out to our table and started talking to my girlfriend about the options. She suggested removing a few things from the vegetarian menu and that she’d give her some extra fries and dip on the side because she’d get less food. It was very surprising to me but it made me so happy to see how well they treated us. 

To be honest I thought we would have to find another restaurant when I found out there were no vegan options and I didn’t want to be a hassle at first by asking. But I am very glad I did! The food ended up tasting really well and they didn’t even charge us anything extra for her meal (considering they went through some trouble for it). 

In the end the food tasted really good and the entire experience was more than pleasant. I left a pretty decent tip on the already kinda of expensive price (I live in a tipping optional country) even though I didn’t have that much money.

TL:DR Cashier accidentally rings me up for more than I was supposed to pay. I would have let it slide because it wasn’t too much but turns out the cashier is a condescending jerk so I get a refund instead.

This happened the day after Black Friday.  I went with one of my sisters and my cousin to go and very our other sister at work at a popular outlet mall. After visiting her, Sister #1 and Cousin and I all decided to go and wander the outlet mall and eventually wandered into a certain gourmet chocolate store.

We sampled some chocolates given to us by a super nice employee and since we didn’t want to just sample chocolates and go, I decided to buy some chocolate sticks that were on sale as an early Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I know that they were marked up for Black Friday but I still decided to go for the buy 4, get 1 free deal. The nice sample lady saw us looking at the chocolate and also mentioned that the deal was buy 4, get 1 so I decided why not get it. The labeling for this deal specifically said that the total for the deal would cost $7.95. I’m the usual poor college kid but I can spend that much on some chocolate sticks for my boyfriend, I like him.

So I grab 5 chocolate sticks and we go to the register. Sister #1, Cousin, and I are all happy and checking out at the counter. The cashier now is an older man, kind of gruff and grumpy but whatever, it’s the day after Black Friday, not every employee is going to be happy. He rings us up and the total is about $10 and I’m confused because the ad specially said that the deal would be $7.95. At first, I think it’s me because I sometimes misread discount signs and I asked him and if it had the buy 4, get 1 deal applied. And in an gruff and condescending tone, he says yes, it just takes $0.20 off each one and that’s how you get the free bar. He gives us the chocolate, doesn’t offer a bag or anything, and gives off an all around vibe of get out. So I get a receipt and leave in confusion.

My sister and cousin and I are all short, young Asian women and I really felt uncomfortable with the way it felt like he was looking down and judging us. I check the receipt with my sister because I want to know where I was wrong about the ad and I look at a picture of the ad that I took before we left the store and reviewed the receipt outside the door. We both decided that there has to be some kind of mistake and normally, we could just let the $2 slide but honestly, this cashier was a jackass and made us feel very uncomfortable.

We go back in and go back to his counter to review the receipt and he tells us to go away because he’s helping another customer. I didn’t see the customer at the counter at first but there was product sitting there I didn’t notice initially and since I hate it myself when I’m working and another customer tries to cut, by accident or not, I move over to the other cashier who isn’t busy. He’s a younger kid who doesn’t understand what I mean when I say that there has to be a mistake with the order. He’s trying to figure it out when the older cashier tries to take over and just keeps telling us over and over that it just takes $0.20 off each bar and if we really want our money back, he’ll just give us $0.20. I keep trying to explain that we were overcharged and he just won’t hear us out.

Luckily, a different employee took over and she was honestly amazing. She took me over to the ad so we can review the receipt and prices and actually figure out what went wrong. My sister and cousin wait at the counter and honestly, I felt uncomfortable enough around the older cashier that I was expecting something racist to be said as I walked away. She checks the deal and sees that clearly, I was overcharged. She decides to rescan the chocolate and make sure that the deal is working correctly so that she can figure out why I paid the wrong amount. We return to the counter and the grumpy cashier we were previously dealing with is watching the nice cashier work. He also starts whispering to the young cashier snide comments like oh, I’ll just give her the $0.20 if she wants it so bad, it’s not a big deal. My sister is watching him make fun of me and starts slowly getting angry. The nice cashier figures out that when the chocolate was scanned, an extra one was rung up by accident and that’s why I was overcharged.

The grumpy cashier notices this and starts saying in a snide, sarcastic, and condescending tone oh, I’m so sorry. Are you okay? I’m so sorry.
As he’s making fun of us, my sister starts straight up crying tears of pure anger. She’s an athlete and used to letting her anger out physically and since she’s not on the field, she has this. She tells him that you can’t treat people like that and he just sarcastically asks, oh, do you need a hug? The store manager has come by during this exchange and has taken over his register and my sister asks the store manager to make him leave because he is just making the situation worse. Store manager tells him to go to the back, and grumpy cashier begrudgingly does so but not before trying to avoid it by trying to help other customers on the floor. 

The nice cashier and the sample lady are both good to us. The sample lady was very sweet and offered my sister a hug and chocolate because she was crying (only my cousin and I knew that these were tears of anger) and the good cashier gives us a coupon and bag of some free chocolate. We apologize and thank the nice cashier and sample lady profusely for treating us so well, especially since it was the day after Black Friday. The nice cashier gets us our refund and we leave. We take a little lap around the mall to calm down because we were all pretty upset and angry at that point.

At one point, it was mentioned that the older, grumpy cashier who caused all of this was new but that does not excuse his behavior in the slightest. I’m a manager in a retail/food service area at my college and if I ever acted that way, I know that there’s no way I would be working there anymore. And if one of my workers acted that, you’d better bet that there would be some hell to pay. No, the customer is not always right but also, the employees can not be blatant assholes. And I can understand being tired and grumpy after working Black Friday but there’s only so much leeway you can get. If we were Crazy Rich Asians, like in the movie, we would most definitely have bought the store just to have fired him for being such an asshole. 

I wonder if it’s too late to call customer service and complain about my visit because we’re still pretty mad.

So I just came back from the gas station after being urged by the comments to talk to a supervisor. 

Ironically first thing I noticed when I walked in was the “register out of order” sign on the credit card reader. 

Thankfully the same B wasn’t there and a much friendlier lady behind the counter went and got the manager for me. 

I shared with him the specifics from my last post and he apologized profusely stating he knew exactly who it was without me even remembering a name. 

He said there would be a serious talk and made it seem like this wasn’t the first case of this employee dealing poorly with customers and offered me a few pages of coupons for my inconvenience but I declined because I felt he took my complaint serious enough and they’d probably just be thrown away or expire.

So thanks to everybody who gave me the encouragement to go talk to them. You’ve helped me embrace my role in life. I am Karen, seeker of managers. I have to find some kids and take them to soccer practice, have a good one y’all.

(Also important for lifestyle people, religion, etc just trying to give some background but I’m not like a meat is murder person) on to the story (so for long ramble I just like to give proper background as to not confuse people later on) 

University cafeteria so the quality of food is already in question but oh well. I see online one of the only good vegetarian meals, the spicy black bean burger, is being served. Sweet my fav! So I go to the caf, pay and go to the grill station. 

Conversation follows M: me GG: grill guy. 

M: hi can I have the black bean burger (important as there are 3 different kinds the black bean, rice and soy burgers often served at the same time as well as normal burger)

GG: oh sorry I don’t have that today. I have a soy burger!

*Ok that not the best one but oh well it’s better then the rice burger*

M: ok sure. 

GG: great. Ya it’s a soy beef burger. 

*Now me being the person I am and the caf having so many problems (this is only the tip of the issues they have) I’m confused by what he means a soy beef burger* 

Me: so is it soy that taste like beef or a soy beef blend

GG: it has soy and beef in it!  

*This whole time he is grinning like what he says makes sense*

M: and beef.....

GG: yup! Would you like it?

Me: ya no, I would like what ever the vegetarian option is....

GG: it’s a soy beef burger. 

Me: ya no thanks.....


I walked away and quickly sent an email the the head of the school food because they got a guy thing that anything plus soy means it’s vegetarian and then send out a Snapchat to the vegetarians in my residence (we all message each other when the caf is good or bad to warn others) about the deal. 

Got an email 2 hours later. Clearly shocked by this and that it would be dealt with. 

At the end I just ate some sooobway (where the staff are the best changing gloves, wiping stuff down etc) and avoid that guys station anytime he worked. 

Short version; had about a 10 min talk with a server. Try to explain that the beef soy blend burger he was offering as a vegetarian burger was not vegetarian because of the beef in it. He could not understand has to email his boss and had soobway instead. 

Update: since many people ask about if I was bitten by a tick (there is a kind that can cause meat allergies) no I have not. I was born this way as was my sister but not my brother. Even when my mom was pregnant with sis or I meat made her sick. Both of us have been to the doctors to find out why and basically we are missing the part that lets you digest meat.  So again no tick bite, not the result of being vegetarian so long just the way I was born.  ",1,Soy + beef = vegetarian....,134

We go in and order our food. My dad got a taco and a burrito, and I got a quesidilla, easy order, right? 

After about 30 minutes of the waiting, there had been nothing, no one had got food, no signs of staff, nothing. My dad starts telling people that are coming in that it has taken 30 plus minutes, and most people left

Well, it took 40 minutes. The entire time, people kept coming in, and guess what, no one ever got their food in that 40 minutes. Not even the people who had been there before us.

Once we finally got the food, we ask what took so long. And guess what they said

658,Backlash101,0,t3_akkh9w,8,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/akkh9w/i_just_wanted_2_donuts/,"So this happened just a couple days ago.

I had a little time to kill before meeting a friend and i was feeling a little snacky, so i popped into a donut shop.

All i was craving were 2 donuts. That's all i wanted. That's about as simple as it needed to be. 

As soon as i walk in, the lady behind the counter seemed friendly. I asked for ""two donuts"". She repeated back to me, ""just THREE donuts? you don't want a coffee or latte with it?"".

I figured she was just trying to give good customer service by offering more stuff, which i didn't mind at first, so i just said ""no thanks, just TWO donuts.""

She asks if i'd like a dozen donuts instead. Obviously i don't need 12 donuts so i refuse. 

She says if i get a dozen donuts, she'll give me a discount on them. Again, i tell her that i only need TWO. 

She insists, and i refuse again. So, she gives up and says okay ""just some donuts"". She proceeds to sneakily put three donuts in my back and ring me up for three donuts. I remind her, that i only needed TWO donuts. 

She pretends like she didn't understand and that it was an honest mistake. She then claims that she already rang me up for three and that there's no way to take one off the order. (seems like nonsense to me because other employees at this chain have definitely removed stuff from my order when they added something by mistake)

If this had happened from the start, i honestly would've just taken the three, paid for the three and just accepted it without a second thought. But between the dozen donuts nonsense and now this, i could tell she was trying to play me like a sucker, and i wasn't having it.

I said ""you know what? i just lost my appetite."" And i walked out. As I walked out she has the nerve to say ""okay, i'll see you tomorrow, right?""

Never going back to this location.

659,YellowQuinoa,0,t3_akmamp,10,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/akmamp/squeamish_post_office_worker_is_not_a_fellow/,"I feel like I should preface this by saying that for the most part, I’m a fairly normal British girl in her early 20s. Except for one thing, I’m obsessed with animals that make most people recoil and have a growing collection of snails/millipedes/tarantulas etc.

During one particularly long hangover, one of my snails managed to lay hundreds of eggs which hatched before I could dispose of them. I didn’t want to kill anything with a chance of life so I picked out the most developed snails and found a new home for them amongst the online community of fellow snail enthusiasts.

Unsurprisingly, the UK snail community is somewhat sparse, so snails are often transported through the national mail service using heat packs. So I pack up my new children, label the box as live cargo and set off to the Post Office the following Monday.

I arrive at the Post Office, doing my best to conceal my slightly embarrassing cargo and wait to be called. Soon, a beaming 20something worker calls me forward. She seems somewhat taken aback as she reads the label. I sense the apprehension as her mood changes. “Oh” she says. “What exactly are you sending?” “Snails” I reply, keeping my voice as quiet as possible, so as not to alert anybody else.

“OH MY GOD, ARE THEY ALIVE?!?!?” She shrieks, backing away from the counter. I grimace at her, begging she doesn’t continue to make a scene. “NO” she continues, “you can’t post these, that is disgusting, please leave!”

Sweat is forming on my brow at this point, as I now have the attention of the entire post office, all other tills and transactions have stoped as people wonder what exactly I have attempted to post. However, I remain determined, confident I am allowed to send my balls of slimes to a lucky recipient. I attempt to explain they are simply tame, tiny baby snails. The situation does not improve. “Why would you send this to someone???” Who wants this??!!”

Thankfully, the only sane employee in the Post Office intervenes and begins to ask exactly why I desire to send somebody a package of baby snails. During this an elderly lady begins to loiter behind me, clearly curious about what I had done to cause such a drama, she hastily relays my snail drama to the rest of the queue. Murmurs and gasps fill the room.

After a rapid back and forth about what type of animals snails are, the cashiers relent and agree to post my snails. The entire Post Office cheers as I make a hasty exit, resolving never to return.

TL;DR: attempting to post some snails, cashier did not agree

660,Osmaso,0,t3_akmda9,1,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/akmda9/driver_mayhem/,"So I have a story with a 3rd party delivery company, I recently saw a certain post made here that I will link in the comments that reminded me of this. 

It was late once night and I was up playing video games with a good buddy of mine who lives in a different state. We where both getting hungry and he didnt really have alot of cash. I was feeling nice that night so I ordered us both food using the 3rd party deliver service, keep in mind I have never been to my buddies house or even met him in person (I know a bit risky but me and this guy where basically bonded by the hip at this point.)

My food arrives in good time, I thank the delivery driver and hes on his merry way. I return to my console and check my phone for how long it was going to take for my buddy to recieve his. Now, I should mention this is partially my fault. The first time the delivery driver, gets lost, and cant seem to find the entrance to my friends apartment complex. The delivery is canceled and as such, I am refunded my money and the driver goes on his merry way. Most people would just give up, but I was determined to feed my buddy for WHATEVER reason that night. Anyways, I put in the order again and using google maps, I attempt to give some more detailed instructions on how to access the entrance  this one fails AS WELL, as I soon find out that the entrance I was looking out was, a brick wall. Finally finding the actual entrance to the complete opposite end, I order one more time. At first I find I've used the wrong entrance again because for some reason, the apartment complex is separated strangely. Giveing the driver one last ring of directions he makes it to the correct entrance, hands my buddy the food and drives off with a pretty pissed off look on his face. 

Needless to say, when I went to order through that 3rd party recently I actually had my account disabled. To this day i felt terrible about what happened, as a service worker, and hoped the drivers understood I was just trying to help my buddy out. In the end though I did manage to get the account re enabled. 

Tldr; I buy food for a buddy through a delivery app, driver cant find my buddies apartment, re order 3 times until finally food arrives. ",1,Driver Mayhem,11

I’m not sure if the woman behind the counter just forgot customer service was part of her job but this is the conversation that followed as I was checking out. I’m just gonna refer to her as B for what she is. 

*I put my card in after watching her press the enter key to pay. *

Me- Excuse me mam, it’s not reading my card

B- You have to wait until I tell you to pay *she moves over to the other register to help someone else*

Me- Okay, *take it out and put it back in again* it’s still not working

B- *clearly this is now my fault* I don’t have time to teach an 18 year old how to use a credit card.

At this point I was taken aback but stayed calm

Me- Mam, I turned 22 today, I’m an adult and know how to use a credit card, I just bought gas outside so I know it’s not an issue with the card. I think something is wrong with the reader

B-*at this point she starts getting aggressive* Outside uses a different system than the ones in here, it doesn’t matter. 

Me-*noticed there’s two registers inside* could you try ringing me up on that one.

662,Rhllor_Lordoflight,0,t3_akae33,73,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/akae33/this_fking_guy_is_going_to_yell_at_me/,"I just want to preface this by saying that I’ve worked hospitality and retail before so I know how bad customers can be. I always make sure I’m polite and respectful to anyone serving me and I get quite upset when people treat others like trash.

About 6 months ago I was feeling quite lazy so I decided to order some food delivered for me and my partner from a “healthier” chicken chain we have in Australia. Order was placed at 7:30 and had a 30-40 minute delivery estimate. We didn’t mind waiting as we were just watching some Netflix anyway.

We watched a few episodes of a show we were binging then looked at the time and realised that nearly an hour had passed and was nearly 8:30pm by this point. Not a problem, decided to call the restaurant just to make sure they had received my order. The lady on the phone was pleasant and apologised for the wait, as it was a busy night, but my order would be picked up by their driver next. I told her that it was okay, I just wanted to make sure they received the order and didn’t mind waiting as long as they had it. 

We went back to watching our show. Another couple of episodes went by without any food being delivered yet and it was now around 9:15pm. The restaurant closes at 10:00pm so we were getting a bit worried that our food wouldn’t be arriving so I called back to confirm how long it would be. The same lady answered and again was polite and apologetic. She said that the order had been picked up by their driver and would be at my house within 10 minutes, and to call back if it wasn’t. 

9:45 rolls through and still no food. I called back and another person answered the phone. I told them who I was and that I had ordered food 2 hours ago and had not received it yet. She asked my name again and said that she couldn’t see an order for my name. I gave her the order number and she said that nope, still couldn’t find it. I asked if she could ask the other lady who had answered earlier because she didn’t seem to have a problem finding it. The First Lady jumped on the phone and said “your food has been delivered”. I replied saying “uhhh no it hasn’t. If your driver has delivered our food to someone, then it was not us”. Our house is not hard to find and I didn’t see anyone rock up to the neighbours houses, so At this point I believed that the driver must have accidentally given our food to someone else along with their food. 

At this point of the phone call it was pretty close to 10:00pm and she said “oh did you order on (x website)?” To which I replied that I had. She told me that she just found my order and apologised that they had not received their notification of it until now. Now I started to get pretty pissed off because for the last 2.5 hours I had been told that they had received my order, knew who I was and my order was on its way. She said something about being logged into her account and my order (not everyone else’s) hadn’t come through because of this....? 
I asked her why she had been lying for 2.5 hours rather than just telling me that they didn’t have my order, then telling me that my food would be picked up next, my food was on the way and that my food had already been delivered? 
All throughout this phone call, I could hear the loud and distinct sound of cutlery and equipment banging around and getting cleaned up, plus their staff all yelling and laughing and joking around (which is fine) but they obviously didn’t know that I could hear all their conversations. 

The lady on the phone offered to turn their fryers and grills back on and would get my new food out ASAP. Now working in food previously, I know how much of a pain in the ass it is turning the fryers and grills back on and waiting for them to heat up right after cleaning them. I just knew that they’d all be pissed off about it and I didn’t want any sloppily made food, or food that someone would have messed with because they were angry about having to stay back.
I told her no thank you, I would like my money back. She told me that she can reverse the credit card payment and will take 3-4 days to process payment. Normally I’d just accept it, but considering how everything had been managed that night already, I was convinced that she wouldn’t actually reverse the payment, then I’d have to try fight to get my money back after it hadn’t come through in the 3-4 days. I told her that I’d rather she deliver cash tonight so I can use it elsewhere and eat dinner tonight. She said that she would and to hold on a second. At this point she was explaining to their driver that he had to drive out and give me this cash which I heard him respond “Are you f**king serious? I don’t want to drive to his house, this f**king guy is going to yell at me!”.

When she got back on the phone I told her that she should be more careful because I heard the whole conversation. She was obviously super embarrassed by this and fumbled an apology and assure me that this staff member would be written up and blah blah blah... 
I asked the drivers name which she gave me.

Anyway, about another 30 minutes go by and finally they pull up to my house, so I go down and say “are you (drivers name)” and he looks super nervous and says n-no. Obviously lying. I told him to tell (name I was given) that he need to be careful what he says and that I was only angry after he said that.

I would have left it there but when I counted the change, they gave me everything back except the delivery fee which was like $6. 
I couldn’t believe they’d try charge me a delivery fee to give me my money back so I wrote an email to their regional management.

The next morning I received a call from their store manager who was extremely embarrassed and apologetic. She refunded the extra for the delivery fee, assured me that the driver would be spoken to, said she’d deal with the person in charge of getting the orders out that were placed online, and offered to give me a gift card which I rejected and I wouldn’t not be eating there again. 

My partner has eaten there since but I still just can’t bring myself around to it. I guess 3 hours to get part of my own money back just sours it too much for me.",1,“This f**king guy is going to yell at me”,1115

She's not even allowed to escort customers who approach her to another employee. She's supposed to say sorry and WALK. AWAY. 

Karen decides my wife needs ""help"" with facing and placing stock on the shelves.

If you don't like topics such as surgery and medicine, I suggest you click off as this will have mentions. On mobile so forgive formatting. 

To preface, none of this was the staff's fault. We didn't talk to anyone or complain about it, because we didn't feel it was worth the hassle. I'm currently recovering from an intensive brain surgery in order to get a tumor removed. In the process, the surgeons made a small flip up and severed some of the neuropathways for my left side. As a result I'm currently invalid and should not be walking very far or very much. Even so, I'll make a full recovery. 

I was getting very cooped up here in hospital as I haven't left on over a week and I get terrible cabin fever. As I'm currently very well bar some of my left side the staff on the ward agreed to dispense us for the afternoon as I was angling to get out. So we decided to go see a film at a cinema two miles up the road. We booked tickets in advance online and ordered a disabled taxi as I was going in a wheelchair. Everything went fine until we got to the screening. 

The disabled seats had a space in front for the wheelchair so that it wasn't in the middle of the aisle, in the way. But when we got to the booked seats (up in the very back row) they had been taken by a husband and wife with their two kids. 

None of whom was using or needed a wheelchair.  Not one in sight. 

The theatre was pretty empty. They could've sat anywhere else. The middle rows were practically deserted. 

We saw them, and just went to sit in the middle rows, forced to leave the wheelchair in the middle of the aisle.

I moved to a new town exactly a year ago and i go to the local coffee shop every morning at 7:17. I order something different every day - a rotation of coffee of the day, iced coffee, or a mocha. The owner and the morning guy are always so nice to me - we chit chat and i have their cell numbers just in case i forget anything again (left my briefcase there one morning and their land line wasn’t working so i ended up exchanging cells with both of them). 

I tip my change most mornings - just coins tho - and with the holidays and usually less than 50 cents. they seem to like me anyway. 

When the holidays approached last month I thought it would be fun to leave a big tip for the year of service. I went in later in the morning when it was busy and the tip jar was full. I ordered something and when the morning guy turned his back, i shoved a $100 into the tip jar. 

Well, this morning morning guy said my coffee was on the house. I smiled and asked why - he told me they poured over the video from that morning and tried to figure out who had left them the $100. He said they noticed it was odd i came back in that morning (I had never been in mid- morning in a year) and they saw my hand push into the tip jar and compared to how i normally let the change fall from my hand into the jar they knew it had to be me!

I was in high school at the time, and it was a newly built high school (my year group was the second year to enter and all of the buildings weren't complete). No matter what walking route I took, I always passed an IGA (which closed down late last year), and decided to go in there everyday to buy some food to eat at one of the two breaks. 

I can't remember what I was buying this day, but I certainly remember what happened. IGA's tend to not have self check out, so the person who was checking me out had seen me multiple times at this point. In my bank account, I only had $2.30 and the total ended up being $2.35. I mentioned to her that I only have $2.30 on my account and that I can show her, and I did. So, what she ended up doing was changing the price so I could make the purchase.

Even though I ended up no longer going to this IGA as often after realising that they were selling near expirey (and from what I heard, past expirey date) food and drinks, it was still an extremely nice gesture and was extremely grateful.

We decided to splurge and order delivery, which we can't really afford and do very rarely. My two little kids and my wife and I finally settled on something we were all excited about that would last us a couple of days, and put in our order online.

We're vegan and my wife has a tomato allergy, so on each item I made a note asking for no dairy and no tomatoes, with lots of pleases and thank you's. (I figured it was repetitive but I wanted to be clear - and we'd ordered from them in the past and gotten dairy even when we asked to have it left off.) I feel bad that the online ordering system we used doesn't allow us to tip the folks at the restaurant, but we did add a more-than-20% tip for the delivery person.

And then the food came, and there was cheese on half of it! Not a lot, just a few bits here and there, kind of mixed in. Not enough that it looked like it had been added deliberately, but maybe just enough to suggest that it had already been there and had been picked out?

Also we ordered dolmas - as a mini-appetizer and also as a paid-for add-on on a salad, and we received a total of 2 1/2 dolmas, 1 1/2 of them covered in feta. I say 1/2 because one of them was mashed and half-not-there. I was like, really? I've worked in food service, and I cook for my family, and I just can't imagine serving someone such a tiny, mangled amount of something, covered in an ingredient they specifically asked me not to include.

Also, as a vegan, dairy isn't an allergen or just something we dislike - we avoid it for moral reasons, almost like being Halal or Kosher. When we find it in our food it brings up a lot of painful thoughts of animal suffering, and is truly distressing.

I'm a pretty meek, shy, socially anxious person, very bad at advocating for myself. But this was ridiculous. I called the restaurant, and let them know about it. When the person on the phone said she'd ""try to make it right"" I told them I didn't expect anything, I just wanted to let them know it made me less likely to order in the future because this was not the first time it had happened.

So then I picked off the feta - and discovered a bunch of small pieces of tomato. Again, not so much that it looked like they'd added big pieces of tomato to the salad in a normal ""hey this person wants tomatoes"" kind of way, but almost like they'd picked the tomatoes out of a salad that had them pre-mixed in, and missed a few little pieces.

Then my wife noticed our spinach appeared to be missing and I called them back and they clarified that it was in a little soup container, which it was, and I felt like an idiot and apologized. I could tell the person on the phone was annoyed with me and I was super embarrassed to be a ""problem customer,"" wishing that I'd looked more carefully for the spinach, but still upset about the cheese and tomatoes.

Anyway, here I am ranting about something pretty inconsequential and silly, which was probably just an innocent mistake or miscommunication or something, but which really frustrated me since we've been customers of this place for over 15 years and really don't want to have to pick stuff out of our food before we can eat it, when we're paying through the nose already for a very rare indulgence.

I'm unsure whether we'll order from them again in the future. There's another place where we've had similar issues (egg in pad thai despite asking for no egg), and we've continued to order from them with no issues - but we always call and make sure of the order after putting it in online. I'm just wishing that making an extra phone call wasn't necessary to make our allergies and dietary preferences apparent, when these online ordering things provide a place for people to make a note. Do they just not read the notes? Do they not take them seriously? Do we just give up on this restaurant? Argh.

Thanks for reading.

There is an amazing hibachi grill that I love going to. You know - the big table that seats 8-12 people who are generally there in groups of 2-4 people so most of your table are strangers seated together. Two things the entire table shares are the grilled vegetables and the fried rice (both of which, along with each person’s meat of choice, arrives on a cart with the chef when they come to your table to cook). I hate when one person says “I love mushrooms so can I have those but no onions or zucchini?” Guess what, lady? I love mushrooms, my husband loves mushrooms, and so does my mom. But now she gets all the mushrooms and the rest of us mainly get onions and zucchini. Another time a person (and in one case, 2 in the same party) says “I don’t really want any veggies just extra rice instead”. Again, now the remaining guests get extra veggies and less rice. I love their rice, too, but I would have just requested an additional portion when I placed my order - not at the time that cooking is ready to begin nor at the expense of the others sharing the food. 

Chefs - please explain to these customers that hibachi doesn’t work this way (at least at any I’ve gone to), go to the kitchen and get more mushrooms/rice, or at least ask the other 7+ people if they mind. And just for clarity, these are not allergy requests, they are just a person’s food preference. And yes, I could bring this up to the chef but then I look like the jerk.

673,damnitjanet6,0,t3_ak42d0,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ak42d0/the_bus_driver_who_hates_students/,"So this happened around a year ago; I’m a student in a big uni town with a couple of different universities, and at the time I lived on campus so i suppose it was fairly obvious that I was a student. 

I used to work a pretty physical job in my hometown, about a four hour train journey away from my uni campus, and I had come back to my hometown for a few days to help out at my workplace. I had been up since about six am, finishing things off at work and then getting the train back to my uni city. By this time I was exhausted; it was about nine in the evening and I was waiting at the bus stop with a few other non-student people. It was raining, and I was tired and miserable. Finally, about twenty minutes late, a bus pulls up. The driver opens the doors, and I let an older couple get on in front of me. The driver is a skinny older man in his fifties, and he greets the older couple in a really friendly way, selling them their tickets and telling them to have a nice evening.

Then it’s my turn. “This is the 23 bus that goes to the uni, isn’t it?” I say, and smile at him.

He glares back at me blankly. “Are you stupid?”

I’m slightly taken aback. “No, I was just checking because—”

He cuts me off. “Can you read? Or are you too dim?”

I’m really shaken by his response at this point: I’m autistic and have really bad anxiety when talking to people I don’t know, so this is a nightmare scenario. “I’m just checking because sometimes the 23 bus goes a reverse route and I just wanted to make sure.”

He sighs really loudly in my face. “If you can read then why are you wasting my time with stupid questions? What does it say on the front of the bus?”

“I’m sorry,” I say, confused as to why I’ve insulted him so badly. “I’ve had a long day, I’m really tired, I’m sorry if I’m being stupid.”

At this point, he explodes. “A long day?? You’ve had a long day??? I’ve been driving a bus since nine this morning, luv, I’ve had a bloody long day.” He continues to rant at me about how me claiming to have had a long day is an insult to people with real jobs. “Are you retarded or are you deliberately wasting my time?”

At this point I’m on the verge of tears. This man is yelling his head off at me for being entitled and stupid, and how all the students are like me and we’re all snotty entitled little shits. All I want is to go home. I pay, and he charges me for a return even though I asked for a single, but I don’t want to be berated anymore so I don’t question it and I go to sit down.

He continues to complain about me to the next two customers who get on. I’m absolutely humiliated and confused as to why he’s so angry with me- everyone on the bus is staring and talking about me. When he starts driving he’s driving super fast and taking corners scarily tight like he’s taking his irritation out on the road. When it finally gets to my stop, I get off and say “thank you” to him, and he bellows something at me that I don’t hear because of my headphones (that I’m using as ear defenders) and then zips away, skidding on the rain-soaked tarmac.

Even if it was a stupid question, I don’t know that it warranted that response. I’ve always had a phobia of public transport, and this episode set me back a long way. I work in customer service and get my fair share of questions that I consider daft but I would never berate a customer for it like that. I wonder if maybe he had some bad experiences with students my age and was taking it out on me, but whatever the reason, I was really shaken up afterwards.

TLDR; ask bus driver where the bus goes, get screamed at at top volume, asked if I’m retarded, and embarrassed in front of all the other customers.

674,xxfay6,0,t3_ak3foq,1,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ak3foq/how_many_people_does_it_take_to_order_a_pizza/,"This happened last Sunday afternoon, my mom left to run some errands and said that she'd be buying Pizza when she comes back. Turns out that meant ordering delivery, as later I was on my way out and saw her calling. I offered to pick it up myself but she refused, ""should've told me sooner"" when she had only said ""Hi"".

When I come back, my mom's out on the street. We've heard a few delivery motorcycles going around, and one of them told us that another one was lost. In the end, he never found our address and gave up / returned to base. We decide to head out and go to a different place.

There's a Pizza chain that's been expanding a lot throughout my town, let's call it ""Tiny Romans"". We go to one we had close but in a part of town we weren't used to (after we tried another place that was closed), it was *packed*. At least they have a drive-thru, but it's moving slowly.

While waiting, I had a look at the menu on the front entrance, something I hadn't seen before caught my attention, so after telling my mom (who's very hungry due to the missed delivery) I had to assure her that most of their Pizzas are ready during peak hours, especially the one I'm ordering which is *literally front, center, and the biggest square of the menu*.

Once we reach, this happens:

Girl: Hi welcome to Tiny Romans may I take your order?

Me: Yeah hi, I'd like a *Deep Dish Box Set* please.

Girl: It would be a 8-10 minute wait, is that ok?

Me: Oh, uhh I'd rather not... do you have the full (actually 2 halves) Deep Dish ready to go?

Girl: So you want the *Full Meal* instead? (2 regular Pepperoni + 2L Soda + Breadsticks)

Me: No, I'm asking for the Deep Dish.

Girl: So you want the *Pepperoni Cheese Bread*?

Me: No that's not what I'm looking for. I want the Deep Dish, with 2 Pepperoni halves.

Girl: One sec please.

*about half a minute of silence*

Girl: Could you please clarify your order?

Me: Ok, what's in the Box Set.

Girl: So, the Box Set comes with half a **Pepperoni Deep Dish**, and a *Cheese Bread*.

Me: Well, instead of the Cheese Bread I just want another Pepperoni half.

Girl: I... I... I really just don't understand what you're trying to order.

Me: You know what, I'll just walk to the counter.

Guy: Ok so a Deep Dish, that's gonna be all? What's gonna be your name?

Me: Yes that's all, I'm /u/xxfay6

Guy: Ok, it's gonna be a 10 minute wait, please park ahead.

My mom is furious, she had told me just order 2 Pepperoni while I was on the mic, without specifying that she wanted me to order regular Pepperoni. So after she screams at me for ordering something that wasn't readily available, I head into the store. I saw 2 people with drive-thru headsets, I asked the guy if he had my order correct and he repeated the order (using the same tone as if it were still using the drive-thru), it was correct.

During the 10 or so minutes I was there, I must've seen around 50 or so boxes, all Pepperoni. I guess this part of town thinks like my mom in that they don't offer *anything* else. They also didn't take card and I saw absolutely nobody even try (until I did).

Started conversation with a lady and her kid, talked about Spider-verse and Glass, nice people. After about 12 minutes my order is up and I'm able to go.

My mom was *not happy*. Berated me for doing my job so badly that they had to get 3 people to get my order right (I didn't notice a voice change during the hold) along with not ordering 2 Pepperoni. I open the box and show her what I had ordered: 2 Pepperoni (squares).

After eating, she finally apologized after thinking that yeah those doing the drive-thru were idiots, and the one I ordered was actually good instead of the cardboard you're used to get.

I had a medical issue of an embarassing, female nature involving my lady bits. When I was diagnosed the doctor said there was a medicated cream I could use for the problem only there was seemengly a shortage so she would have to wait to write me a prescription.

A couple of months later I still hadn't heard from her, but I was in a pharmacy one day so I thought I'd ask if it was in stock.

When I got to the counter there were other customers waiting and I, too embarassed to ask for the cream out loud, googled it and got a photo of it on my phone.

I showed it to the pharmacist and asked did they have it and she promptly took my phone (without asking) and went to show another pharmacist. Then they started laughing. And looking at me, my phone, me...laugjing the whole time. I would have just left out of sheer embarassment but they still had my phone. But that's not the worst part.

The pharmacist comes back, tosses my phone on the counter, then tells me that bdcause of my *names condition* the *names cream* is prescription only so I need to go to a doctor. She made no attempt to lower her voice or be discreet so now other customers know what's wrong and what I was looking for. 

I was humiliated. So much so that when I left the store, I never set foot in it again.  I was so angry and upset but I didn't put in a complaint. Even now I regret that I didn't. Those two pharmacists made me feel like crap.

678,Komalandorinha,0,t3_ajsfjv,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ajsfjv/worst_icing_ive_ever_seen/,"About two weeks ago me and my friend (I'll call her R) were mooching around town and I was also looking for a birthday present for my sister.
We decided to go inside a well known chocolate retailers and I liked the look of the personalized chocolate items they had in stock so decided to buy one.
I go to the counter and the lady behind kind of reminds me of my form tutor in school who hates me because I am not white. She had one of those ""I want to speak to your manager"" haircuts. 
So anyway I ask for this star to be personalised. 
Here's how the conversation went. I'll call her L for lady. 
Me: ""hello can I get this personalised please?""
L: ""yes that's fine is it for a boy or a girl?""
I'm really not sure how this question was relevent to this exchange but anyway..
Me: ""... It's for a girl""
L: ""ok and what colour icing would you like?"" 
She showed me a selection of colours. I chose green. Lady proceeded to get the egg out of its packaging and started icing the star.
I'd asked for it to say happy 21st.
I watched her and realised that she'd started icing way past the middle of the star, and it was upside down. I glanced at R, she gave me a raised eyebrow. I returned my eyes to L who had started rambling on about the weather in a really weird voice.
I was too distracted by her icing to give much of a reply out pay attention to the small talk. It was as though a five year old was writing the message.
So picture an upside down star, she'd started writing happy in squiggly writing half way down the star, then 21 and then an indecipherable smudge. 
I looked over at R to see if she was witnessing this.. She's holding back laughter which makes me fight hard to do the same. I'm expecting L to be finished at this point but no, she continues. 
It's worth noting that at this point there isn't any more room left except for the ""leg/point"" and I realised she is trying to fit birthday in this tiny amount of space! She writes BIRT across and then HDAY down the rest of the star to squeeze it on. 
I'm really fighting hard to not burst into laughter here but I remain composed as she fumbles it back into the box, smudging the icing even more whilst telling me ""it takes a while to dry so be careful"". 
I look at it, look at the pre decorated ones on the shelf and say ""is it ok if I just take one of these?"" She has a completely deadpan face and just says ""yes"". 

Before anyone asks, I'm fairly certain she didn't have any condition or disability that would impair her skills but obviously not all handicaps are visible. You'd think they would train staff in writing the messages though!

A few months ago, I was doing my route as a dog walker, dropping off one of the pups in an affluent neighborhood. As I pulled up to my client's house, a delivery truck was blocking the driveway I use to stay out of traffic.

I catch up with the driver, he's delivering a high-end refrigerator to my client's neighbor, and ask him to move a few feet forward so I can fit behind him.

I tell her she's not allowed to scream at me, I'm just doing my job and I will be gone before she can blink.

I am a young female in my early twenties, but had a really bad bout of sciatica. If you don’t know what sciatica is, it’s just super bad back pain. 
I was out on a walk in town with my friend, with the side intention of getting my sweet housemate a gift, but was pretty much at the end of my rope in terms of pain. Luckily, there was a card shop on our way back and I figured I could pop in, grab a card and go home. 
Now there’s another important bit of information in this story, I live in a small city. As a result, I very rarely use cash money, and I don’t like carrying much, So when I go in the shop, grab a bunch of stuff (not just a card) I don’t have the means to pay by cash. So of course, the cash machine at my till goes down.
It becomes quite clear that the girl serving me is learning the ropes (I’ll call her Learning Girl LG) and was being assisted by an older lady (OL)
OL: this card machine is down, she’ll have to pay with cash
Me: (annoyed that she’s standing right in front of me but is talking as if I’m not) I don’t have cash on me...
OL: She’ll have to go get some from the card machine around the corner.
Me: (can see 5 other tills, but assumes none of them can be used) Ok, please keep my things for me.
So I limp out, get money and come back. When I return it becomes clear that nobody is waiting for me and I’ll have to queue up again, which I do. When I reach the till to LG again I get this:
LG: hello 
Me: Hi... 
LG: ...
Me: I was here 5 minutes ago, you have my things to buy?

After a nice evening dinner with my mom, we called an Uber to take her back to the hotel, and me to my university 30 minutes away. 

She and I sit in the back seat talking in Russian about our days and the like. She’s dropped off and the Uber driver makes the usual “what language are you speaking” small talk. 

Slowly the conversation goes into the “you’re Russian so you must be communist” assumption so many people make. The conversation goes for 30 minutes with small talk in the cigarette stenched car with J the Jamaican Uber driver saying these things and me just nodding along.

J: “ I’ve always wanted to visit Russia, mainly Moscow and Siberia though.”

“I’ve read a lot of books on the Cold War, it’s such an interesting topic” 

“You know, Stalin was such an amazing ruler. Fear truly is the best motivation. I read that they had bells at his rallies to signal when to finish clapping, because no one wanted to be the first to stop clapping and die.”

“What’s your opinion on Vladimir Putin? He’s pretty amazing, I love that guy.” 

“Honestly the moon landings were fake. If they’re so real why haven’t we done anything more up there with all this new technology?” 

Me: “ didn’t China just send up a probe or something”

J:” I mean sure AI and probes, but a man? Nah.” 

J:” I would’ve rooted for Russia during the Cold War.” 

“In Jamaica there was this amazing club called platinum, and all the Russian strippers were there” 

“Something something Russian girls pussy something killed if Stalin were alive” (I didn’t hear what he said fully)

“It’s time for a new Stalin” 


The reviews on Uber for this guy were fine, I am amazed he thought speaking about wanting another Stalin and cussing and asking me (19 F) to cuss is okay. He wasn’t even an old guy, but more like a 20 year old. The whole time I was just nodding along and trying to disengage the conversation, or switch the subject... it didn’t work.

This is long so TL:DR at the bottom. Please bare with me as I set the scene. 

When I was 17 I was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. For context, I’d always been very self conscious of my weight and appearance - I was a size 6/8 (Australian sizing, about 2/4 US) and 5ft8. 

Fast forward about a year and I’d been struggling pretty badly with my disease; I’d been on steroids for about 3 months at this point (you’re not meant to be on them longer than 6 weeks) because nothing else was working. Now, one thing to note about steroids is that they make you gain weight and bloat. I went from 60kg to 73kg in that time which meant going to a size 12... not at all good for 18yo me who was self conscious about my body as a size 6. 

Anyway, summer rolled around and I realised I would of course not fit into any of my swim suits. I went to a popular brand that sells pretty pricey stuff because I figured I’d treat myself in this situation (think $150 for a swimsuit). For emotional support, I brought one of my best friends with me because I knew this shopping trip wouldn’t be fun. I was trying on exclusively conservative swim wear that wouldn’t show off much body. 

Long story short, I started crying to my friend in the change rooms. It was a horrible experience thinking back on it. I didn’t feel like myself and felt like my disease had taken over my life. 

This is when the store employee came to check on me, if I needed any sizes, the usual. She noticed what was going on (I think she overheard a bit of the conversation) and asked if I’d like to try on a swim suit she knew would suit me perfectly. I said yes but was very skeptical when she came back with a bikini. Now this lovely lady spent about 45 minutes with me showing different ways to style the bikini and pointing out all the ways it flattered my body. I ended up feeling better about my body than I possibly ever had before. 

When I got changed back into my clothes I checked the tag. $180. For a bikini. I was keen to treat myself because I was feeling so low, but that was SO MUCH MONEY for an 18yo working in hospo part time. I decided that I’d do it anyway and just not go out with my friends for a few weeks because, hey, this bikini made me feel great. 

This is the most amazing part. I went to check out and this lady, no, this ANGEL told me she was going to apply her staff discount that she hadn’t used up yet and gave me 40% OFF. I thanked her profusely and she said she was just happy for me that I was able to find something to make me feel more confident. She wished me luck with my treatment and I left the store... After leaving her a $20 note for being such a kind hearted person. 

TL;DR - 17yo me had pretty a bad body image, got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Medication made me gain a bunch of weight so had to buy new swimsuit when summer came around. Store employee noticed how distressed I was and found me the perfect bikini, made me feel like insanely confident in it, then gave me her last remaining staff discount (40% off).

The phone store was fairly busy, so I had to wait a while for an associate to help me. Unfortunately, the older lady he was helping before me was a straight-up asshole. He was so kind to her, and got her SIM card working within just a few minutes. Rather than thanking him for finally fixing her phone, though, she went off on him for his ""poor customer service""! I overheard pretty much their entire visit and knew that he had been nothing but helpful and professional to her, and she blew up at him for no reason, saying he should ALWAYS put the customer first (uh, he did?). She even went so far as to say he hadn't been raised right if he thought it was okay to be this mean to her.

Remember that the store was fairly busy. I wasn't the only person in there awkwardly glancing over at this lady, wondering why she was being such a bitch to this poor guy who literally did everything right. He had been listening to her rant, occasionally saying something like ""I understand"" and ""I apologize"". Then as she continued to escalate he finally said ""Ma'am, I am doing the best I can to help you..."" but she interjected ""LET ME FINISH. I'M TALKING. LET ME FINISH!"" The associate continued ""...but I will not allow you to speak to me in this way. You are not being kind and I will not allow it."" The whole time he was trying to stand up for himself this lady kept saying ""LET ME FINISH"" over him, not listening to what he was saying. When he finally let her speak again she said ""Where I come from in Montana you'd be eaten alive by other men who are more kind to their customers than you are. Man up, cowboy!"" With that she took her things and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Poor associate guy took a breath, put his retail smile back on, and came over to me, saying ""Okay, now how can I help you?"" I immediately said ""First off, you did not deserve ANY of that. She was so rude, and I'm really sorry. You were really kind and I don't know what went through her head. I'm also sorry I didn't help you talk her back down."" Then we continued with my phone trade, and he was really kind and polite with me, too. As I left later I said ""You were great. Thanks for all your help. Hope your day gets better!"" and he responded with ""It already is, thanks to you!""

I ended up blocking his number because it was happening too often and it was emotionally taxing.

The other day on my break at work I'm on reddit on my phone and my voicemail icon pops up, which is weird because there was no call.

Turns out my phone company lets you block a number but it'll only block texts and calls from ringing, a blocked number can still leave a voicemail.

So I call customer service and ask what can be done about it, and the guy I was talking to was nice and understanding on why I didn't want voicemails from a blocked number. 

He talked to his supervisor and found out that they're aware of that problem and working on it, but right now the only way to get the voicemails to stop are to change your number or close your voicemail in hopes that they stop after a while and you can reopen it. I'm glad that they're working on it but seriously how did that get overlooked in whatever process it takes to set that stuff up?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd just like to start by saying that we use this food delivery service quite often and have never had problems with them until now. I mostly blame our ""delivery"" person and the manager we spoke to.

So, we ordered food from a restaurant about 15 minutes away from us. We had a long day and we were too tired to cook so we thought, ""why not have a treat and get some take out?""

Around the same expected ETA, we get a call but are unable to answer it because the line is busy. The driver calls back. Upon us answer, ""hello?"", the phone hangs up immediately. We do not receive another call from them after that. We then call customer service and tell them we think the driver is lost since we saw they were driving away from our house on the tracker. The customer service operator proceeds to call the driver then tells us, ""She did not come to the door because she felt unsafe going out given that she is a woman alone in the dark."" We told the operator that we live in a quiet suburban neighborhood. He then tells us that he has contacted the driver and that the delivery person will be on her way.

We wait about 15-20 more minutes and still no sign of food so we call customer service again to just complain that it should be here and we've called before. They assure us that it is on the way and they have been in contact with the driver. We then see what we presume to be her car drive past our road quickly and turn. Finally, we decided to check on the food delivery service's website and check to track where she is. Instead of in process, the order shows as delivered.

At this point, we are very confused and decide to finally call the delivery woman. She answers. We start by asking, ""is this the delivery person?"", she first asks what, like she couldn't hear us, then she answers yes. We then ask, ""Are you coming to deliver the food?"" Immediately after we ask, she hangs up again on us.

We are fed up at this point so we call customer service again and tell them the whole story. We knew the delivery person was not going to come. The first representative we spoke to did not quite understand us. The representative told us that she could refund us $50 on the order in credit. However, we paid over $60 for the food and we didn't feel it was fair for them to not fully refund the order or replace the order. We then asked to speak to a manager. The manager was quite rude and short with us while also being (somewhat) apologetic. We asked if they could replace or refund the full order amount. The woman told us that she could reorder the food for us. However, upon checking with the restaurant, it would be closing in 10 minutes and they probably would be unable to deliver the food again. We then opted for a refund. The woman told us the same thing, that we could only be refunded the $50 ""maximum"". She went on to say that it was our fault because we have to ask, in the delivery instructions, for the delivery person to come to our door. We've never had a food delivery person from a food delivery service *not* come to our door so we called BS on that. After much deliberation, the manager agreed to give us $60 in coupons however, the coupons are split into $25 coupons with an extra $10 one so we cannot use these all together in one order as it is one coupon per order.

We were so annoyed at this point, we just took what we could get and they cooked a very quick meal. Later after this happened, we tried to look up some delivery people's experience with food delivery services and found out, from other Reddit users that the delivery person should wait seven minutes at the least if the person does not answer the door. Our delivery person waited about 30 seconds to one minute before driving off. The users of Reddit also stated that if the food is not successfully delivered, the delivery person can keep the food. That means that this woman, instead of getting the tip, drove home with $60 worth of food instead.

Although this experience has not been pleasant, we will continue to order from this food delivery service, but we will be much more careful of delivery people like this woman. We were laughing while simultaneously being annoyed during the whole situation. Thankfully, the manager told us that the tip was included in the refund.

I don't know why the delivery person kept hanging up, but I think, if it was due to feeling ""unsafe"" or ""anxious"", I would suggest she consider another job.

\*\*I would like to add that we have dealt with dashers and other delivery people in the past scared of our dog. It's weird though because he is very friendly and he doesn't bark or growl. He likes to sit in front of the glass door and wait for them to climb the stairs. We briefly considered this may be the reason why she was ""scared"" to come to our house, but brushed this idea off after remembering she made absolutely **no** attempt to get our attention. She didn't exit her car, roll down her windows, flash her lights or anything.",1,Our Horrible Food Delivery Service Experience [Repost],27

We live in a semi-small college town that manages to support a crap ton of fast food joints. On our way to my husband's job we stopped at the home of the burger ruler. 

Now some background on this place. It's usually deserted or mostly empty. This is due primarily to its location right behind a hill and on a curve of the fast food alley. It kinda sneaks up on you when you're driving and a lot of people miss the turn and don't want try and go back. Usually their service isn't too bad and the food is really fresh since they don't make anything until someone actually comes in and orders.

Back to tonight, when we walked in there was no one in the lobby and no staff at the counter. After a minute or so my husband called out, ""hello?""

A disgruntled employee comes from the back and gruffly says, ""ya?"" while giving us the stink eye. He doesn't wait for an answer and just returns to the back. My husband and I exchanged a glance of wtf before a female employee comes out all smiles.

She asks us what we'd like and we give her our order, thinking okay maybe the other guy is just having a bad night. It happens and we're not too bothered by it. 

Then her cell phone rings. As she's putting our order into the computer she pulls her phone out and ANSWERS it. We finish paying and get our drinks, all the while she's talking to someone on her cell and laughing at whatever they're saying. 

We walk away to fill our cups and she continues her phone call while taking the order of the guy who came in after us. 

To top it off our food was clearly old and had we eaten there we would've taken it back and asked for fresh food. I think this was the worst fast food service we've ever had.

My BFF was very careless with her belongings, losing her iPod several times. One day we left the restaurant and realized that Savanah (friend) didn’t have her iPod. She panicked and we knew she must’ve left it at the restaurant, cuz she had it there and did not have it  in the car. We called the restaurant and asked if they had found an iPod. They said no but they’d keep a look out. We asked if they could possibly watch the cameras when they had time but they insisted they saw nothing. 

Fast forward to a month or so later, the iPod had still not been found. I’m sitting on the couch with the aforementioned sister. All of a sudden, I get a FaceTime call from “Savanah.” I was like ‘uh what the fuck’ cuz I knew it was still lost! Or so we thought. 

After a few seconds of throwing the iPod around between my sister and I, arguing over who would answer, I finally give in. I answer and see a young child. Then, I see a man in the camera. 

I’ll be damned if it’s not the waiter from the restaurant. 

Luckily, I was able to screenshot the picture in time before he rapidly hung up.

Decided to get our cats a new litter box and some other stuff. My SO and I go to a big chain pet store. Let’s say petfart. I think that’s different enough to claim some plausible deniability. 


Alright so we have our stuff and we’re at the register and the cashier lady asks me about my pin. My pin says “plant mom”. My SO chimed in and says “Also Cat mom!”
To create some noise during checkout, a process that always makes  me feel like I have to talk because I get nervous, I say “Yeah and one of my cat babies ate one of my plant babies today”.  Cashier lady raises an eyebrow and starts going into an increasingly uncomfortable rant about how much she dislikes cats. 


She works at a fucking pet store. And I know you don’t have to love the shit your job is about. I know. I get it. We got to pay rent. Okay but this lady started telling me about how she would take her kids pets and drive them into the damn wilderness and LEAVE THEM THERE. Including cats. Especially cats. 

Both SO and I are nervously laughing because we find this disgusting and want to exit this conversation as quickly as possible. 

I just can’t fathom saying something like that out loud. Like holy shit that’s animal abuse. My mom did that to some of my pets and then some. And her mom did that to literally all of her pets. And I hate her for that and I have so little respect for anyone who does that. It’s disgusting. It’s inhumane. 


The lady finished off with, “Well if the cat finds its way back then it can stay because it earned it.”


I wanted to roll my eyes and throw up a little. 

I just can’t. And saying it out loud at work where you’re around pets all day and probably have to care for their wellbeing. Where your manager can hear you talking about committing neglect and abuse of animals. I just....What. The. Ever loving hell. 


Anyway, it wasn’t a long one, but that happened and it made me really fucking mad. As it was, a couple weeks ago while on the road, I saw a car dump a kitten out into a busy road right at the entrance of a freeway. I turned around and got ready to get out my car, when I saw a car stop to save the kitten. So thankfully someone was there for that. And I’m glad other people care as much as I do about animals and you know. Not killing them or being cruel to them. So for someone like me to hear someone talk about doing that, like it was coffee chit chat? Holy hell. What the hell. Why are some humans so horrible!?!?


**Edit: called this morning and they thanked me for making them aware of it. I don’t know if they actually took it seriously. This huge chain let store isn’t known for being excellent when it comes to animal wellbeing. But I can at least hope the manager cares.**

704,kitticatmeow1,0,t3_ahzu06,26,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ahzu06/van_rental_makes_me_lose_my_cool/,"So, this happened about two years ago but I was a reddit noob at the time and didn't know about this sub. Also on mobile, please forgive me for any formatting errors.

My boyfriend and I were moving back from Des Moines to Omaha (about 2 hour drive if the troopers are doing their jobs) so we rented a moving van from a well known company who shall not be named. (if you would like to know, please PM me. I get the greatest of joy out of giving them bad reviews)

I booked the rental on line for a set amount for the base price of the van plus mileage. All in all, I think it should have been about $250 (again, long time ago and details are foggy).

On the day we go to pick it up at a third party vendor, their rental system is down but I show them my receipt email and they hand me the keys, no biggie. Now here's where it goes down hill.

We move and drop the van off at the same place we picked it up at (we were driving my car back for the final part of the move). They tell me my total which is close to $600. Nowhere near what I had been quoted and waaaay over my budget. They look into it and I had been charged the full price for everything, not the special price I had actually agreed to and was on my receipt. Cue me calling their 1800 number.

This interaction is by far the worst I have ever experienced. Apparently since their third party rental system was down when I picked it up (not my problem), it reverted all contracts to their normal cost (not my problem) even though they can see in their main system what my contract actually was, I need to pay the full amount or they can't close out the ticket (again, not my problem) After speaking with 3 different people for over an hour, they pretty much said tough shit, pay the full amount or well charge you for theft or some other nonsense and refund you the money in a month. I lost my cool and absolutely lost it on this guy. Normally, I understand when an employee is just spouting off what their company forces them to do but this guy was placing the blame on me and refusing to take ownership that it was his company's problem and was a breach of contract. What kind of company leaves their customers on the hook for their own failures? 

Since we absolutely had to get on the road and I was being held hostage, I charged my credit card and went on my not so merry way. I called their customer service the next day to get my refund and complained my way into a super generous offer of an additional $10 compensation for my hassle. Lol. They tell me I'll have it within three weeks.

Three weeks pass and low and behold, it's half what it's supposed to be! Round three dealing with their abhorrent customer service and I am absolutely done with this company. The rep I got this time around was condescending and rude and gave no apology for the wrong amount being refunded. Another three week wait and it's $5 off the amount the rep pinky swore was being refunded. At this point, I just let them have it.. My blood pressure was sky high from these people.

Phew . That was cathartic. 

TLDR: Due to their own system issue, I was charged more than double contracted fee for van rental, company took zero ownership, refunded me the wrong amount... Twice. ",1,Van rental makes me lose my cool,532

706,Cukimonster,0,t3_ai41od,10,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ai41od/awful_customer_service_with_both_the_cell_phone/,"So my husband and I both have the very popular fruit phones. But he cracked his screen, and while the phone still worked, he couldn’t see anything but blurred lines. Well we have insurance through the phone company (I obviouSly can’t tell you the name of the PRoblem company, but Its Not That hard to guess.) so he calls to see what he needs to do to use the 30$ replacement fee our insurance offers. As it turns out, he has to be able to access his phone to submit a claim. (???) 

He can’t see the screen, so that’s a no go. The service company tells him he has to contact the manufacturer. He contacts the manufacturer, and they say he has to go through the service company. He’s bounced around for hours, told there is no help to be offered over the phone, and he will have to go to the store itself. Of course, we moved awhile back, and now the closest of either stores is a 4 hour drive. (There are repair places that do screens, but they want to charge what we would pay to replace the entire phone, and it wasn’t worth it.)

So now we make the drive, and hit the service store first. They say they can’t do anything, and we have to go to the manufacture’s store. Which means that instead of the 30$ we were supposed to pay (why even bother paying them for the insurance if they refuse to let you use it?) it will now be 100$ to just swap the phone out. He’s fed up at this point and caves. So he gets the new phone, leaves the store, and finds out he can’t even set it up without WiFi. 

When he does finally get it started, the phone won’t let him log in, because they put a security procedure in that makes you have to be able to see the old phone to get a code to use the new phone. Obviously there is no way to do so, even if he had possession of the phone, because the screen is dead. 

So he calls the service company, and is told he has to call the manufacturer, again. He does that, and is told he has to contact the service company. He goes back and forth between the two for 6 HOURS, got hung up on several times, and no one can do anything about it. Also, the two factor identification service CANNOT BE REMOVED once you agree to adding it on your phone. (For anyone who hasn’t added it yet, seriously consider this if it is your only fruit company device.) You can add another phone number to your account to get the text, but it takes 5 days before you can use it. 

In the end, he finally gets ahold of someone in the manufacturers customer service who has him do something (that all the others have told him wasn’t allowed) to get around the two factor issue. He had to create a whole new account to get the phone itself set up, remove the sim and put it back in, get the text to his phone number to access his old account, and then finally got to log back in as himself. 

It was absolutely ridiculous. I know issues like this can’t be that uncommon. He had all of his account info to prove he was himself. How is it that neither company has a way around it? People break and lose phones all the time. I guess if you have multiple devices already logged in, it might not be such an issue. But it honestly seems like a huge oversight. 

And for the record, our service company has no signal in our home. We can’t make or receive phone calls at all while in our house, (that isn’t to another fruit device over the WiFi) and had to add a landline. And taking the 14 hour drive from where we used to live, about 8 hours of it we have no signal at all. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a new service. Yes, the service itself is actually very reasonably priced. The lowest we’ve found for what we have (unlimited text, talk, and data). But if you can’t actually use any of those things, it’s not exactly saving you any money. ",1,"Awful customer service with both the cell phone service company, and the phone manufacturer.",61

Tl;dr at bottom


So my very soon to be husband and i have been putting together a VERY low key wedding that we wanted to be as low stess as possible. Funny I know. So we tossed about ideas for rings and where to get them, what we want, and all that fun stuff. 

Before the holidays we stopped into one of the big box retailers at the mall just to look around. At the counter was a wonderful woman who walked us thru all the options asked us the appropriate questions and warned us to buy now as they were the best prices we were going to see. Needless to say we decided to think about it, but she left us with such a pleasant experience it stuck with us.

After much looking around much later the rings we had chosen at the big box were still our favorites. We proceeded to go back this past week and take another look. Low an behold the same lovely woman was working and im so, so glad. 

Once again she walked us thru all the options and we hung our heads a little as we realised she was right and the rings were in fact more expensive. Here is where this gem of a woman behind the jewlery counter really shined.

She explained a plan that would have made the Cohen brothers proud on how we were going to save the most money and get exactly what we wanted. While this plan took a little while to execute we had time to visit.

 During said time we got to chatting and it turns out her parents used to own the restaurant my mom had held her legendary birthday parties at my whole life. Sadly the place had closed down shortly before i was old enough to attend. But oh i had heard the stories and seen the pictures! I told the lady about how much my mom had loved it there and how she always loved the food especially the cannolis. 

This beautiful woman in the midst of bending over backwards to save us money offhandely mentions she would bring some cannolis in for my mom when we come pick up the rings. Now were all a big ball of skeptics and naysayers so we smiled and said that would be lovely. Paperwork done we were on our way(complete with hugs and well wishes)

Today my mom and I went to pick up the rings as my fiance was working. I didnt breathe a word of this to her excpet the restaurant connection(you know just in case)

GUYS SHE DID IT!!! THIS INCREDIBLE WOMAN MADE MY MOM HOMEMADE CANNOLIS JUST FOR HER!!!

I still cant belive it. My mom almost cried. I almost cried. I cannot get over how wonderful warm and selfless this woman was. Easly one of the best things i have gotten to experience and wanted to share the warm and fuzzies with you.

I lived in a foreign country for a couple of years, and for the record, I loved it, it’s a wonderful place and I sincerely hope to go back and visit again soon. When I got to this country, I didn’t speak the language or know anything about the customs or culture, but I learned pretty quickly and about a year and a half later, when this incident happened, I was pretty acclimated to the culture and spoke the language almost perfectly if I might say. Also an important side note is that because of my nationality and the requirement I had to always dress professionally, lots of locals assumed that I was rich, which was very very much not true, I was basically broke, and that I didn’t know what was going on due to the language barrier and a cultural difference, but as I said earlier, I was there for a considerable amount of time and picked up on it while I was there.

I went to buy a half a kilo of bread at a bakery and the store owner put the bag on the scale and looked me dead in the eye and said “70 pesos”. I could buy all my groceries with 70 pesos at the time.

“Excuse me?”

“70 pesos”

“Your sign says bread is 14 pesos a kilo, this is half a kilo, shouldn’t it be 7 pesos?”

The owner looked embarrassed and said “oh shoot, you’re right, I messed up my math, sorry it’s 7 pesos”

I told her I didn’t want to buy her bread anymore and went to a different bakery. I wasn’t about to give business to someone who wanted to cheat me out of that much money.


Edit: lots of people are asking questions, like why is bread sold by the kilo, it’s easier to weigh them than it is to count them out, picture French bread but the size of a large dinner roll.

Then I discovered a small restaurant offering a burger+chips+beer deal for just €12.50 so I dived in, got seated and ordered and had my burger+chips+beer. 

When I went to pay, I handed over a €20 note, but the waitress said she didn't have change, and did I have anything smaller? No, I said, and then she asked a colleague whether he had change. No, he said.

She then asked me me if I could pay by card. Yes, I said, whipping out my card, and she got the card terminal ready, and payment was accepted. However, she didn't hand me back my €20 note. Now, I'd had a few beers beforehand, plus I'd just had another beer, so I was visibly oiled. Plus I couldn't really speak the local language, and I was on my own. When I asked for the €20, she pretended not to understand. Then I managed to work the right form of words in the local language to say ""I gave you a €20 note. Please may I have it back"", trying to adopt a body language suggesting ""I am not going away until I get my €20"", and suddenly she remembered about the €20 note behind the counter and gave it back.

Last night my family and I decided to go to our local TGIChilibees after an outing. To start, the server took forever to come greet us, easily at least 10-15 minutes. She took our drink orders, which were as follows:


Me: Dr. Pepper

My boyfriend: Water

Dad: Sweet Tea

Mom and Sister: Strawberry lemonade


When she came back she set the drinks down and gave the water to my dad, leaving my boyfriend drinkless. No problem, my dad handed the water over. Then the server looked at me, who was drinking a dr pepper, and told me my sweet tea was coming. Weird, but whatever. She leaves and we realize the hostess only dropped 2 sets of silverware/straws for 5 of us.


The server comes back with the tea and asks about apps. My dad asks if I want fried pickles, but I say no because my sister doesn't like them and ask for cheese fries (with the 2 for whatever combo) and chips and salsa. She takes the order, brings the chips and salsa and some more silverware, and leaves us alone for a bit.


She comes back to take our orders, which are as follows:


Mom: Soup

Dad: Grilled chicken salad, side of beans

Boyfriend: Fajitas

Sister: Pasta 

Me: Quesedilla 


My boyfriend and I are doing the 2 for whatever so she asks what app we wanted, and I explained again that it was the cheese fries. She says oh yeah that's right, I got that, finished the orders and leaves.


A while later, she brings by fried pickles, drops them and leaves quickly. Everyone at the table stares at them for a bit. I just kind of laugh and we decide to just let it go because we have chips and salsa as well, but it's a bit annoying as only my dad and I like fried pickles. 


We finish both appetizers, our drinks have been low for a while, and the server hasn't visited us since she dropped the pickles. We realize at this point that we've been in the restaurant for an hour. It was a Friday night, but it was by no means busy at all, and none of us ordered anything with a long cook time.


The server comes back and drops the food, everything except for my dad's salad. She asks what she's missing and we tell her, salad. She was like ""oh, just a house salad with ranch, right?"" And I said no, the grilled chicken salad. She says she'll go grab it, along with a plastic spoon for my mom as she was unable to find a metal spoon. 


She's gone for a really long time, which tells me she completely forgot to order my dad's salad, which was weird because it was the last bit of the order she'd taken and she was writing everything down (plus she had remembered his side of beans). She finally brings it, and some refills for our drinks, but no spoon. We remind her of the spoon and she goes to get it. At this point my dad realized that he didn't have any dressing for his salad. He ended up just using the leftover ranch from the pickles because we had no idea when she would be back.


It was fine after that (except she didn't clear any dishes until we had paid already) but I think she was starting to tell we were getting annoyed with her. My sister and I have both served and we were theorizing that we were one of her last tables and she was probably trying to do her side work so she could leave. Whatever the case, we ended up tipping 10%, which is really low for us but in our area is probably about what she was expecting anyway. ",1,A meal that unintentionally took well over an hour,61

Meanwhile the waitress had stuck her head back into the kitchen and spoke quietly to an older man (presumably the owner) then said to me “You sit down, you’re not to worry about it. I’ll bring the coffee over to you, which size were you after again?” I thanked her and said I’d go to get the money as soon as I’d finished feeding, and she shook her head and said “no way, this one is on the house.” 

Went and got the money anyway as soon as my baby settled and when I got back to the counter ordered lunch from a different waitress and asked to pay for both the food and the coffee I’d been given earlier.

So, the show is winding down and the server brings me the check. I hand her my credit card and she walks away. A few moments later, she comes back with the receipt, ready to be signed and to have a tip added, as usual when you go out to eat.

Wake up. Rub left hand ring finger for that familiar metallic reassurance of life. There is no ring. That can't be right. Am I dreaming? Open eyes, look at hand, feel hand, TASTE hand. No ring. Fiancee still sleeping. No worries, it's on the bathroom shelf, took it off before shower. Not on bathroom shelf. Nowhere. Panic. Despair. Heart-breaking loss. 

It's just a silly symbol. It only cost $133 (after \[worst ever seer\] ring sizer discount). It kinda irritated my finger anyway. What's the big deal.

HER symbol. OUR money. In Soviet Russia, finger irritates ring. The biggest deal.

\*\*Hope Lost\*\*

It's been months. Memories fade. I don't even know what the ring looked like. Was it gold? Silver? Round? Square? Maybe it did fit. Maybe I threw it away in a fit of anger. Maybe it slid off in a fit of passion. Nobody knows.

The finger knows. It misses the ring. It cries for the ring. It FEELS the ring. Rub a sore spot in the finger where the ring used to be. The precious, precious ring. My precious. MY PRECI... wait, wrong story.

Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars. The Gentleman asks 88% more than it has ever asked of us. But it is The Gentlemen. How could it? Why would it? Is it not the very same symbol of my love? Is it not a mere REPLICA of times gone by? How could The Gentleman, in my time of need, forsake me so?

\*\*The Seer on the Mountain\*\*

Michelle of customer service. Perhaps she can restore the faith I once had. Perhaps she can convince The Gentleman that chivalry is not dead. Tales are shared. Scars are compared. Fame, fortune, failure. Alas, she can not. The best Michelle can do is convince The Gentleman that the world wants him, not that it NEEDS him. Days pass. Weeks, who knows?

\*\*Prophecy Professed\*\*

But Michelle was wise beyond her years. Oh benevolent, brilliant Michelle of WeddingRingWebsite customer service. The most important thing she knew, what that she did not know all. There were others. Others more powerful than Michelle could ever hope to be (Michelle had aspirations far above stereotypical expectations. The top. THE VERY TOP). Hello, Customer Hapiness Officer.

\*\*Prophecy Fulfilled\*\*

And so I beseech you, Customer Hapiness Officer, can YOU convince The Gentleman that his services are needed more than ever before? That one soul's very purpose on this planet is threatened by the hole left on the finger of his once-bearer? Do even you, the great Customer Hapiness Officer have the power to restore The Gentleman, size 8 (pretty sure the ring sizer said 8.5, but to downsize for a 6mm width) to his former glory of $133? Can you fulfill the prophecy?:

I hope so. We all hope so. But mostly me. I'm probably the only one that hopes so. Maybe the gf/fiancee? Who knows.

Two months ago she got into a horrible car accident. Drunk plowed into her and her sister. Thankfully both are ok, but my wife suffered multiple fractures and two leg operations with pins, etc. 

Recently she’s been feeling much better and is home from the hospital and rehab so we wanted to go out for dinner. Now she does have a wheelchair but she’s been doing really great with her physical therapy and is using crutches. So we decided to go to a chain restaurant here in town. Mind you my wife has a heavy brace on her leg obviously it’s visible she’s got a injury. 

We go into the restaurant a six minute wait, cool we take a seat and suddenly a family of ten piles in, kids, a pregnant woman and a miserable older lady. I get up as does one of the other men sitting. The pregnant woman says thank you and gives us a smile as she sits. Granny gives my wife the stank eye, she sits down and asks her, “how old are you? Didn’t your mother teach you manners.” My wife looks at her, like what the hell lady. She tells the woman she had surgery and has to stay off her leg. 
The woman grunts and then looks at my wife, “lazy cow.” (my wife weighs 120 pounds this woman probably 230)

My wife ignores her and starts showing me something on her phone. This woman knocks  my wife’s crutches on the floor. “I said get up!.” She gives us both a death glare.  Thankfully her daughter and son in law stepped in, and our table was ready. 

We get our food, eat our delicious meal and get our bill. The manager comes to see us, he’s a African American man (my wife is African American as well) he tells us the hostess told him how rude the lady was to us, apparently she let loose with a racist rant after we left. 
Her family was completely mortified and the hostess had alerted the manager. Unfortunately they turned away her party thanks to her behavior, I say that as her family seemed like good people. The manager offered us free desert and apologized again. 

Class act and we will definitely be going to eat there again. 

Edit: when she went off on us we were in the waiting area of the restaurant there was two benches and there was plenty of space for others.

Are you all sitting comftybold two square on your botty? Then I'll begin...

I wanted RoFo chicken last night. I am not sure how it works where you live, but here, you go to a kiosk/terminal, and select what you want, then it kicks out a ""receipt"". You take the receipt to the cashier and pay, they give you a different receipt, and an appropriately sized paper bag. You return to the chicken counter and wait for them to call your number. Simple enough.

I got my reciept and bag, and went to stand near the chicken case, which was unattended at the time as the employee had to get something from the back. I was the only one waiting.

He returned, and grabbed a bag. He walked over to the chicken case and opened the door.

At that point, a woman clutching a receipt, who had come in after I had paid, approached the case, and asked him to ""show her a chicken strip"". He lifted one with tongs, and she complained that they were small.

He began filling my order, as she started pointing and saying ""I want THAT piece."" 

He asked her to ""wait a minute"" and she said ""NO! I want that piece right there! THAT one.""

He told her ""This is not your order, ma'am"" but she just kept repeating that she wanted this piece or that piece, pointing into the case, and getting really aggravated.

I thought maybe she could not hear him, or was not paying attention, so I said ""Ma'am, he is still filling my order, but I think you are next.""

She screamed ""That's it! I've had it! I don't NEED this!"" She slammed her receipt down on the counter, and stormed out of the store to her car. She did not wait for food she had presumably PAID for, and I was shaking my head. The kid behind the counter looked at me and asked ""What just happened?"" 

I told him ""I was just trying to let her know that the order you were filling was mine and she got all upset and left. She just needed to wait her turn."" He agreed, saying ""What's so hard about that? I mean, she was next. Wait your turn.""

I pointed to the abandoned receipt and told him ""Somebody gets a free meal!"" and smiled. As I left, she was speeding out of the parking lot.

So initially, I thought that she was not aware that I was in line ahead of her. Then, after her outburst, I thought her problem was that he DARED wait on me first, even though I was THERE first, because she had been talking to him about the strips (i.e he was already working with her). 

It was not until I got hime that I realized what was REALLY going on... 

She understood completely that I was in line ahead of her, and that the chicken he was bagging was for me. She was  trying to tell him which pieces NOT to give to ME, so she could have them!",1,I want that piece there!,447

There is no line so I make my way to the guy serving. I put the bourbon down, and say 'hi'. The guy looks at me with a slightly blank expression on his face, blinks slowly, and grins back. He tilts his head as if thinking, and says 'hi' back. He looks down at the bourbon and scans it with a portable bar code reader. While he is doing this I am looking at the fridge of soft drinks (soda) behind him. I see there is a deal for two 2 Litre bottles, and think 'why not?'.

I ask if I can also get the 2 bottles of coke for $8 deal. He looks at me and says ""Sure"", stares at me a bit longer, then turns around. He takes the three steps to the fridge, reaches out and pauses, turns back to me and asks me what I wanted again. By this time I have a massive grin on my face as I can tell he is stoned out of his mind. I repeat what I want and proceed to watch him try and pick up two 2 litre bottles of coke, he is hampered by the fact he still has the scanner in his hand.

(In the next sentence each comma is an actual pause in his actions) Eventually he puts the scanner on a shelf in the fridge, picks up the two bottles, turns around, walks the three steps back to the counter, places the bottles on the counter, looks at me, looks at bottles, looks at hands. He is now frowning, searching the counter top for his scanner. I am close to bursting out laughing at this point, but I manage to say ""It is in the fridge."" He looks at me befuddled, ""What?"" he inquires. I continue, ""The scanner is in the fridge."" He smiles, nods, turns around, walks the three steps back to the fridge, opens the fridge door, stares, closes fridge door, opens correct fridge door, stares, picks up scanner, closes fridge door, turns around, walks the three steps back to the counter, stares at me, stares at counter, stares at scanner in hand, something almost audible clicks, and he finally scans the drinks.

Recently we got hit with some medical bills and decided we need to budget better. Our grocery spending was very tight and it was the weekend before Thanksgiving. We looked at all the ads and gathered our information about what stores to hit. We went to one of the higher end grocery stores in the area because their turkeys were on sale. 

Now, I'm a sucker for chips, I love them and could eat a whole bag in one sitting. The store was running a sale on their off brand chips. I stopped by to look at them and my husband explained that we should stick to our budget. I agreed and put them back sadly. A lady complimented us on sticking to our budget and we agreed it's hard, but necessary. She also told us our kids were cute. My son, who is 2, waves and giggled to her. We moved on and I didnt think anything of the conversation. 

We went to the front to pay. A bagger ran up to us as we were paying, saying a lady had bought us two family size, name brand chip bags! I was so grateful! That's never happened to me in store before.

Meanwhile our cashier is price checking our Turkey because it rang up as full price. I'm not sure who overheard us talking about which credit card to use, but as we left the store, another bagger ran up and gave us a giftcard for $50. They said a lady wanted to wish us a happy holidays and didnt want any recognition. Even the bagger was excited for us, saying they had never seen this before. 

I'm still not sure if it was the same lady who bought us chips and the giftcard or two different ladies, but it made our day. We came back later and used the giftcard for our groceries over the next month to buy our meat. ",1,Being on a budget is rewarding,1569
725,Barbie66,0,t3_aglhjy,25,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aglhjy/the_ol_snapchat_switcheroo_local_auto_shop/,"About three years ago when I was just out of high school and living at home, I had to take my car into an auto shop for some maintenance. My mother taught me well and I knew to be weary of all auto shops in general and never blindly agree to additional services or parts. We typically only go to a local auto shop where both my mother and my grandfather have maintained a positive relationship with the owner for the past 10 years. The owner had my family’s trust, and for the most part the other shop workers tended to be respectful and honest. However this one trip there about three years ago was appalling. 


I was inexperienced with auto shops and rarely went in without my mother accompanying me, but this day she was busy and I was going to wait for a ride back home from another family member.
After entering the shop, I realized that the owner wasn’t there and instead a younger (mid 20s) guy walked from the shop to the desk. I’m female and I was around 18 at the time, and I was very nervous and timid but somehow seemed to attract his attention as he attempted to flirt with me. My anxiety was heightened already due to going to the shop by myself and I just wanted to drop off my car and wait for a ride in peace. I was polite though probably not dismissive enough, but I know I wasn’t flirting back or being suggestive in any way, shape, or form. After handing him my keys, he asked for my name in the system. Since I typically go with my mom, my car was listed under her name in the computer and thus I replied with her name to the guy. I barely thought anything of it and the guy confirmed my moms cell phone number for when they call to let us know they are done servicing the car. 


At this point I was relieved and left. I didn’t even bother staying in the waiting room, I just went outside and stood on the sidewalk until my other family member picked me up. At this point I guess the flirting could be seen as harmless, and I was more sensitive to it because of my own anxiety, but of course it didn’t end there. 


A couple hours later into the evening, after my mom got home, we were doing laundry  together when her phone buzzed with a text from a number she didn’t recognize- and when she opened it, the message was from the auto shop, letting her know my car was ready for pick up. She immediately turned to me and said that she was confused because the shop usually calls her cell phone, never once had they texted her. Moreover, the number that texted her wasn’t the shop’s business number- it was from someone’s personal phone. She said it was unprofessional and didn’t understand why the sudden change in protocol. I then explained the flirting behavior from the guy, and since when he asked for my name and I gave him hers, perhaps he thought that he was texting me. 


So we left together for the auto shop to pick up my car. I didn’t talk to the guy when we arrived, as I simply cowered behind the protection of my mom as she dealt with him. We went to pay for the pre-agreed services and the guy attempted to tell my mom about how, when taking my car out for a test drive, he thought my brake pads might be needed to be replaced. Well, I didn’t know much about the history of my car, but my mom did. They did not need to be replaced. Either the guy had no idea about the existing relationship my mom had with the Owner, or just felt like two females were easy targets- but my mom stood firm. We paid our bill and left, my mom more than annoyed for having an employee from a trusted shop try and pull one on her. As we got home, another buzz came from her phone. This time it was a Snapchat friend request- from the same personal number used to text my mom about my car being ready for pick up. Yup. This guy just added my MOM on Snapchat- thinking she was me- and sent her a pic and some flirtatious line. 


So of course she did what she thought was best- she took a selfie and sent it back. No words, just pure parental hate. Needless to say, we did not receive a response. 


My mom did get in contact with the Owner to discuss how the company’s private customer information was being abused by this employee. The owner was more than apologetic, I guess explaining that he was only hired in the first place because he was a son of a friend or family member.   He then went on to inform my mom that he had already fired from the auto shop due to poor performance among other things. 


Luckily- we haven’t seen the creep since, and still maintain our positive relationship with the auto shop owner. And while the behavior by the employee was extremely inappropriate and unprofessional, it did give us quite the laugh imagining him being excited to open Snapchat just to see my mothers disapproving face staring back at him.

I ordered some high class fashion, think of the stuff you would see walking down the runway, off what I thought would be an efficient high class made site. Considering it's made by.. let's say someone who knows how to make clothes that make you go ""whoa!""

I ordered, and chose my correct sizing, however when I got to checkout I noticed that instead of an XL for a dress and size 7 for a shoe. Somehow it was a XS and a size 12 lmao.

So I contact customer service, a nice chatty lady replies to my emails saying that she could totally refund the order or just process it. Now I decided to go forward as there's two major problems with the site.

1. If the line of clothes is out of stock, girl it ain't ever coming back. But if you order it, nobody else gets it cause it goes in the bin. So why cancel it if it means someone else fabulous can't get it?

2. They give you a different size if they have it in instead. So no matter what you're screwed.

So you know, I thought to myself, no problems I'll just send it on back and everything would be 'Hallelu'

Yeah. No.

Got the package and two of the items are just to die for. Perfect quality and everything. The sort of stuff that makes you want to strut down to a ball to get everyone looking at you.

But with good things, bad stuff always seems to come in too.

Apparently they give you a super friendly return slip. Nice and easy just send it on out and off you go with your refund.

Guess what?

You cannot remove any clothing from it's original packaging, you can't remove the shoes from the box even though they should somehow have a box covering the insides so that it's eligible for a refund.

If it was brought on sale then you get store credit which runs out a year from now. But if they don't have your size it's tough sugar honey. You ain't getting a thing.

You also can't have damaged the packaging in any way (ie: if it got a little snagged whilst being processed. Then boo hoo.) You can't send it back if it's been over fourteen days because apparently UK laws or trading standards doesn't apply to them.

However, the greatest thing of all is I looked up the company online.

Honey do your research. Everyone was warning about how cheap made it is, how horrendous customer service is and how it's nearly impossible to get a refund.

All I'll say, is just do your research, and if you love your idol. Never buy from their clothes line.

730,kdropdaddy,0,t3_ag9ixw,122,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ag9ixw/the_time_i_got_my_eyebrows_waxed_and_went_home/,"[Warning: A bit long]

TL;DR: I got a very shitty wax. The waxing job caused about a 2.5 inch band all across the base of my forehead of tiny bumps packed tightly together. It looks like a super hero mask, but instead of being around my eyes, it was around my eyebrows and instead of being, you know, a mask, it was a million hard little bumps. Took almost 2 weeks for my skin to return to normal. Haven’t had any eyebrow waxes since. 

I was 16 and it was the first year I had a job. I was making decent money since I worked about 30-35 hours a week on top of school (I loved the feeling of making my own money). I always plucked my eyebrows myself because they were very easy. They already had a good natural shape and usually only needed cleaning up.

Well, my friend at work had eyebrows that were always beautiful, just amazing. I asked her about where she went and she said she went to this little beauty salon in town. It was a little more pricey ($45-$55 for an eyebrow wax) than most other places in town, but I was making good money for a teenager so I wanted to treat myself and splurge. 

I went in one Sunday and they said a walk-in was fine, their eyebrow specialist wasn’t seeing anyone. So, I go in and tell her a little about my finicky skin. 

I was 16 so even though I washed my face, my skin would get rather oily anyway. I didn’t get acne or zits much, my skin just gets really red and irritated very easily (no matter how much water I drank or what products I used, I could never curb the oily-ness and redness, but it’s getting significantly better as I age). 

Anyway, the lady says that my sensitive skin is no problem because they have special products they can use after.  I then told her I just wanted them cleaned up a bit, maybe made a little bit thinner. She told me that was easy and started mixing up the wax. I sat in the recliner seat they had and tried to relax. 

She started putting the hot wax on and doing her thing. She could see me wincing, but it was my first wax ever and man does waxing hurt.... So then every time she’d pull a strip off, she’d immediately apply pressure to the area with her fingers and rub really hard. I’m still not sure why she rubbed so hard. I get that some rubbing can help reduce redness or pain, but this lady went at it. 

She pulls off the last strip, throws it away, says “You’re done. You can head up to the desk to pay now” and leaves the room. I got up and looked in the mirror and my eyebrows looked fine, pretty much the same as when I pluck them. But the area around my eyebrows was angry red. Very angry. It looked weird because it was a perfect, red halo about an inch thick completely surrounding my eyebrows (think action hero mask, but instead of around my eyes, it’s around my eyebrows). Since I was 16 and inexperienced, I thought “Uhm...ok. Well I bet it’s cause it was just waxed so it’s a little irritated. I’ll just go home and put on a little aloe to calm it down.” 

I got to the front desk and the lady looks up. For a split second, she gave me a semi-spooked look because of the stark redness and the weird way it made my face look. Then she broke back into her front-desk smile (albeit a bit of a nervous looking smile) and gave me the bill (~$45). I just paid and left. 

I left the very softly lit beauty salon and went back to my car. I pulled down the visor and opened the mirror and, oh boy, it was way worse in daylight. It was ANGRY red and I started noticing tiny bumps starting to come up. I just thought, “Yea I gotta get home and moisturize the fuck out of this skin.” It was extremely sensitive to the touch (which I know waxing does make skin sensitive to the touch but this was real painful). 

I drove home (about 10 min) and immediately went to the bathroom to tend to my skin. Tiny, little bumps covered every inch of what used to be my red action mask around my eyebrows. These bumps were raised enough you could see them from the side. They were kind of like tiny zits, but there were HUNDREDS. Every single spot of my skin that was red before had bumps. Not one bit of skin without bumps. It felt surreal. Touching it was like touching a misprinted Braille book where every page got printed onto one page. They were hard bumps, not a ton of soft puss pouches, like significantly raised skin. 

I was freaking out. I looked so weird! It was a unibrow of tiny bumps about 2.5 inches in width across the base of my forehead. 

I put on some aloe, sat on the couch to watch some TV, and talked to my mom. She knew I had sensitive skin but she said, “Something doesn’t look right...” while also trying to be supportive and not make me feel bad about my thick unibrow of zit looking things. 

My dad got home from work and as soon as he saw me, god love him, he stops in his tracks and goes “What the hell happened to your face?!? Is that acne?! What’s wrong with it???” I almost broke down because I kept telling myself it wasn’t that bad, but kept it together and told him the story. He holds my face with his hands and is turning it every which way to see it in different light. He let’s go and just goes, “Oh man, that looks weird.” Thanks dad, no tact. 

I just tried to tend to my angry skin as best I could and went to bed.

I woke up and it didn’t even change in the slightest from the night before. Luckily it didn’t get worse? I had school today and I was freaking out. I tried to put makeup on, but that only helped some of the lingering redness. The skin was still clearly raised and it looked like I had a massive acne attack with little bumps packed so close together. The solid band of them completely surrounding each eyebrow was impossible to hide, so I got to go to high school like that. And it went about as good as you can imagine....

The significantly raised skin and bumps lasted FIVE DAYS. Yes, I got to go to high school AND work with this for a whole week, I can’t even count the number of times I had to explain what happened. It was a mortifying experience. After that, they did turn into pop-able zit-like things, so that Saturday I stayed home and went to town. While I know popping pimples is bad, it actually helped. It brought the height (yes, it stuck out enough I can say it had height) of the band down and the aloe started having a more significant effect. 

It got much better the next day to where I could put on makeup and it would pass as just a teen-skin flair up. And by Wednesday the next week you couldn’t even see anything with makeup. By the Friday after that, all the damage was pretty much gone and I was left with eyebrows I could’ve done myself. 

Since this experience, I have never gotten my eyebrows done again anywhere. Although once when I was getting my legs waxed, I asked for a quick little strip between my eyebrows. The lady did it fast just using the leg wax and gave it a spot of the oil or rub and a little baby powder she used on my legs after waxing. I left with a little bit of redness, but that redness went away THAT NIGHT. As in, not overnight, it went away in &lt;5 hours. AND I never got a single bump. 

I am still scarred to this day, even though I know she couldn’t have done it right, and I never went to that beauty salon again. God. 

Edit: Fixed a typo

Edit 2: Thank you guys for all the suggestions about skincare for fixing/helping this and about threading. I will definitely look into it. 

To affirm some comments, she was not wearing gloves. She also didn’t apply any oil or anything at all after which also contributed to the redness I’m sure. I, being new to the world of consumerism and salons, didn’t pipe up about that. I kinda just assumed the place did what they could within their power to be clean and to provide a good outcome, which they definitely fell short of. Since I was young and awkward and new to rendering services completely on my own (such as not having mom there already to pay for it), I didn’t ask for a refund. I just told my story to everyone who asked (which was about 99% of the people I encountered because I looked WEIRD after it and, come on, I was in high school, of course everyone prodded), so I’m sure my shitty experience got spread far and wide with my own face as evidence to back it up. My coworker doubled down on her recommendation however, saying that she had never experienced anything close to that, so she still actively recommends eyebrow waxing from there to this day. I just decided to call the experience a loss. It didn’t feel worth it to go deal with them again, so I just decided not to go back and, like mentioned, my story had already been spread pretty well.

My wife and I had one of those rare nights when the kids had other plans, so we went to dinner alone. I had a $25 gift coupon to a local fine Italian restaurant, so off we went. We got an appetizer (mozzarella fritte, made with buffalo mozzarella and is divine) and two main dishes (she got a fancy meatloaf with a demi-glaze, I had gnocchi bolognese, to which I added some homemade sausage). Total bill came to $53, and I put down my CC along with the gift certificate. 

The waitress up until that point had been wonderful, keeping up on removing dishes and keeping water glasses full (as that’s all I drink, that’s a big plus for me), but when she opened the billfold and saw the cert, I saw her face fall. I’m certain she expected me to tip on the reduced amount.

It’s a bit long, but this isn’t a normal tale from a customer.  This involves what could have been a very dangerous or fatal situation that was luckily resolved, no thanks to employees help. 

So, this last summer I was at a certain mouse-themed amusement park. Well in one of the parks, the bus stops were under construction, so quite a ways from the park exit they had set up temporary bus stations. My family had dinner reservations at a restaurant at one of the camp grounds, and we were going to take the bus to get there. 

Of course it’s just our luck that our bus is literally the farthest bus stop, and that the bus only comes every 10-20 minutes. Also, it was extremely sunny and nearly or over 100 degrees. 

We trek down the the bus stop, and even though we’d all been guzzling water all day, pretty quickly got thirsty. It was a solid 3-7 minute walk from the firs bus stop to our bus stop. Well, we get there and find out that their idea of shade is setting up two small umbrellas and that there’s no vending or access to water close by. 

We wait in the heat, trying our best to stay cool and taking turns with the others in the line to stay in the small bit of shade. Twenty minutes pass, then 25. We are getting irritated a bit. 

Suddenly I feel a cold sweat and my face feels like all the blood has drained from it. My stomach started churning and I felt extremely nauseous. I almost fell over and passed out.  

My parents freak out, obviously, because I’m suffering heat exhaustion, which can be dangerous. We have no water (we thought we would be waiting 20 minutes max.) We have no relief from the heat. And I’m standing in the bushes dry heaving and trying not to vomit or pass out. 

My dad takes off running. Running a good distance through the heat to find an employee. He has to run out of sight to find someone. Meanwhile, a kind woman there with her husband and son helped me. She held an umbrella over me and then her 8 year old (or so I don’t know how to tell kids ages) notices and gave me his last water. Bless them. 

My mom poured it over my neck and I took small sips. It took my dad what felt like forever to get back. He came alone. He was fuming. He informed us that he had been told that no first aid was available, there was no water, and if I needed cooling I could walk back to the front of the bus area for the air conditioning bus. 

Let that sink in. No offer of assistance (despite the few employees we occasionally seen riding around on go karts and who did nothing), no water, no first aid, no real shade or access to water, and their solution? Walk 5 minutes through the heat that is making you sick to sit on our air conditioned bus that has wheels. 

We were extremely lucky that just then the bus we had actually been waiting well over 30 minutes for appeared. I was able to cool down and re-hydrate. 

Oh yeah, and we asked if there was medical assistance available when we arrived at the campground and we were told there wasn’t. 

My dad later called the amusement park’s customer service and any other phone number he could find and was met with a lot of “well that sucks but too bad.”

TL;DR: I suffered heat exhaustion at a poorly-equipped bus station at everyone’s favorite amusement park. Was told there was no help and if I wanted I could walk five minutes through the heat to their air-conditioned cooking bus. 

Edit: I meant “cooling” bus in the TLDR but I mean cooking is almost appropriate. ",1,"Oh you are experiencing heat stroke? Walk five minutes through the heat! No, nobody else can help you. :)",101
735,SkyeEDEMT,0,t3_agd28z,16,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/agd28z/when_the_cook_came_in_high/,"Found this sub today and I immediately thought of a good story. 

It was around the 2nd week of December when I went out to eat lunch with my mom and grandparents. We went to a fair-sized chain that has a diner feel - large menu about 7-8 pages, about 10 desserts (mainly pies) and serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day no matter the time. 

We order our food and although we’re happy to chat with each other, we begin to get frustrated when we’ve been waiting 20 minutes for it to come out. The restaurant is typically between 10-15. But we are patient and continue to occupy ourselves. Time keeps passing and we’re growing increasingly upset, partially because our waiter hasn’t come to us with any updates or refills. 

Finally our food comes out. It’s obviously different. My grandma and I were going to split a skillet. The person tried to half the skillet and make it in two separate ones - an idea that sounds ok, if you know the right portions of food and if you adjust cooking time accordingly - but it wasn’t. We requested no mushrooms yet they were there, and the hollandaise that was supposed to be on top was no where to be seen. 

I also ordered a side of strawberry crepes. They were the worst crepes I’ve ever seen - thick, more like a pancake than crepe. They were folded strangely and there wasn’t enough filling. There were similar complaints from my grandpa and mom.  

We get the check and I’m surprised to see there’s no discount. I always tend to keep track of when I order, and we had waited just over 50 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food, then had to wait a few more as things were corrected. 

I get a pen and mark off corrections. We were charged for extra hollandaise. Can’t do that, we didn’t get ANY on the skillet. We were just asking for what should’ve been there. I made notes - there were mushrooms when I asked for none, the crepes sucked etc. 

My mom took the bill up but nothing could be changed without the manager. She waits for a few minutes, impatiently, and he comes out looking oddly sweaty in his dress shirt. 

The manager explained that their cook came in stoned, and they sent him home. They’ve been calling their other cook, but he hasn’t been answering - so the manager stepped back there and started doing the cooking, with some wait staff helping prep (makes sense, the onions were of 30 different sizes on my skillet). 

We didn’t receive a discount, or even an apology, just an explanation. Though they did remove the hollandaise and the crepe. 

They kept seating new customers coming in the whole time, and didn’t explain anything. I know it costs a lot of money to temporarily shut down a restaurant for that kind of thing, but I feel like that would’ve been the right thing to do - or at least tell the customers what’s happening!

TL;DR: cook came in high, was sent home. Other cook wasn’t picking up the phone so the manager did the cooking. Food took almost an hour to come out and was incomplete/poor quality. ",1,When the cook came in high,50

738,koala-balla,0,t3_ag5619,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ag5619/awesome_tech_support_guys_threw_me_a_free/,"This took place right after Christmas of 2017, but I just thought about it and love this story so I wanted to share it here! 

My laptop was relatively new then, but still old enough to be way outside of its warranty. It had randomly stopped working in the spring of 2017 and I was somehow never able to make it into my local tech retail store for help. That Christmas marked me heading into my senior spring semester of college, so I figured it was time for a repair. 

This tech store is always slammed beyond belief. I was crazy to go in after Christmas especially, but did have an appointment scheduled for 4:00 that evening. I got there at around 3:50, asked an associate about checking in, and sat in the waiting area. 

4:00 came and went, but it was clear just how much all the store associates were hustling. People were slowly being called up for their appointments. Only when people who arrived after me started getting called did I figure it was time to grab an associate again. I (M) was able to catch a guy (G) as he walked by. 

M: Hi! I was just curious if you happen to know if I'll be called for my appointment soon or if I should come back in a little bit. 

G, pulling up his tablet: Sure, what time was your appointment?

M: 4:00! 

G, slightly horrified: It's 4:45. You've been waiting this long??

M: It's not a problem, I can see you guys are slammed right now. 

G: One second, I'll be right back. 

He went and got a coworker. The two quietly chatted for a moment before the other associate (O) came over to help me out. He was examining my laptop and casually making conversation.

O: My coworker told me you waited almost an hour for your appointment. 

M: I genuinely don't mind, I came in during your busy season and I can see how you guys are all running around! 

O: I really appreciate that, and I see what the problem is with your laptop. Let me go ask my manager a question briefly. 

He found his manager across the store and they had a quick conversation, with the associate motioning my way and the manager glancing over. The associate made his way back. 

O: I know your laptop is well past its warranty and we can't usually do this, but my manager is totally fine with waiving all of the repair fees for you. We'll have to ship it out to be fixed, but it will be free. 

He thanked me for being understanding and we got the repair all set up. I went in a week or so later to pick up my laptop. When I signed the receipt, I saw that the repair cost well over a thousand dollars since basically the entire bottom battery part of my laptop had to be replaced. 

I'm not sure if it's true that they don't waive fees often—they could give out free repairs all the time, for all I know. Still, the two associates I spoke to were awesome and so professional. I know this store offers amazing training, and that was really evident in how they helped me out and communicated with each other about my wait time, which is part of what got me a free service.

Recently like two weeks ago I ordered a crap ton of books like hundreds of dollars of books ( this was a birthday present to myself I don't usually spend all my money on books I gotta save up and spend responsibly ) anyway I ordered a crap ton of books and since it was the holiday season they were having so many sells. I also have Honey so with all the sales and the coupons that Honey found I got freaking 200 dollars off! To say the least I was very happy about that and placed my order.

Low and behold I check my email and come to find out my freaking order didn't go through! I was so pissed because this is literally the FOURTH TIME this has happened when trying to order from them. What made it even worse is that some of the sales and coupons where not available anymore so if I wanted to reorder the stuff again it was gonna be a lot more expensive. So of course I called customer service and tried to see if they could give me the same deals I got the first time since it was there stupid systems fault my order didn't go through!

I had to call SIX TIMES 2 because they hanged up on me and the other 3 because something happened to the connection. When I finally was able to talk to someone they gave me to a manager in the US who said yes she could reorder the stuff for me and take off the extra money and I would see it go back into my account after all the books where shipped. So of course I said yes after asking her MULTIPLY TIMES if she was sure I would get the same deals and over and over she assured me yes.

LOW AND BEHOLD the freaking books are shipped and are sitting here in my room as I am typing this and guess what!? I didn't get the deal she charged me full price! I was pissed yet again and yet again I called customer service because I needed my money back or else like heck I was keeping all these books if they were gonna cost that much! Again I had to call MULTIPLE TIMES until I talked to yet again another manager in the US expect this time this other freaking manger said the other manger made a mistake and they can't take that much off. WHY!? In their words "" We just can't "" Then this beach HANGS UP ON ME! WHAT THE F! WHO DOES THAT! WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS!!!!

I called back again right after and spoke to someone else who was not a manger and also not in the US but this lady said for all my trouble I would get a refund of the money they said they would take off.

That was like 5 days ago and here I sit yet again and there is no refund and I don't they ever actually planned on giving me one. At this point I'm just really tried. I'm gonna try and call again but after that if still nothing happens I'm done.

What pisses me off the most is I have shopped there for years literally spent thousands of dollars there yet their stupid systems screw up but they won't fix the problem and refund me what is but a small amount for such a big company ( even if they are going out of business )

Characters: 
RH the Hostess
S1 our original server 
S2 the other server 

So a best friend was recently out on a trip and just got back from said trip. So our group of 6 decided to go out to eat and catch up for lunch. We went to an all you can Korean BBQ place we frequent often. 

(For those that don’t know, this Korean BBQ is where you order your meats and you cook it on the grill at your table. It’s all you can eat for 2 hours. You can order as many as 5-7 meats at once.) 

Back to the story. Five of us get there and decide to sit down and get the ball rolling so our sixth wouldn’t have to wait as long. So we sit down and the RH (tho not rude yet) tells us since it’s 6 of us and automatic 18% gratuity will be added to our bill we’re cool with it since we no longer have to do the math on it individually. And  we wait, about 10 min passed before a server (S1) came to get our drink orders and to put the meat orders in. We also ordered a salad and rice bowls for everyone. 

Then we start catching up and waiting for our food to arrive. Our rice and meats get dropped off by another server (S2) and we start cooking it. About 15 min later we finish cooking about 3 plates of meat and our drinks and salad still haven’t arrived yet. We’re like okay no problem, more room for food as opposed to drinks but we manage to flag down (S2) and we finally get out drinks. The lunch continues and we’ve ordered our second round of meats and we still haven’t received our salad. We again flag down (S2) and we finally get our salad and some more meats. 

The entire lunch we hardly saw our initial server, we kept having to flag down S2 to get our orders through. We didn’t really mind as we were catching up about the trip and generally enjoying each other’s company. We weren’t stoked about the service but we also understand that it’s a little busy, not packed but busy enough to keep the servers occupied. 

Anyways , we finish our lunch and we were treating one of our friends so we were splitting the bill 5 ways as opposed to 6 ways. The total bill was $143.02 (yes I remember the total because I’m still angry about it) so the total divided by 5 is about $28.60. And yes the total included the auto grat. So we are like sweet, my 4 friends each put in 30. So for you math wizards, we have a total of $120 so far. So I put in $23 and we actually managed to find 2 pennies so we had exact change for them. We were stoked because it hardly works out like that. 

And let me say that we hate asking them to split the check because it’s a hassle and we didn’t think that they would because of the auto gratuity. So we all pitched in cash instead to make it easier for the servers. We have a friend who is a server so we know the struggles and decided not to try make the server work more. We also didn’t mind the 18% auto grat because the other server was swift and efficient. 

Anyways we put all the cash in the bill folder and leave it on the edge of the table and continue talking for about 10 min. We decide to go to Friend’s house to keep hanging out. We carpooled in 2 cars. As we are driving away, literally almost out of the parking lot, I see a white figure (a person wearing a long sleeved white shirt, not a white person, not trying to offend anyone) just barreling towards my car. I kinda freak because this person could run into my car so I brake. 

And it’s the hostess for the Korean BBQ place, and I’m like what the heck, concerned that we left something at the table. I rolled the window down and RH’s like , “You guys just can’t leave like that, you shorted us” and this was said in a very sassy and rude way to us. And we’re like, what the heck. We aren’t the type of people to short any servers, we know the struggles. And she straight up accused us of doing this on purpose. AND SHE CHASED US. She’s holding the cash is all like you guys shorted us $40. 

And we’re like WTH , it’s def not possible, two of us counted it twice to make sure we had it right. But RH’s like “You guys NEED TO PAY” and I looked at my friend like wth, what do we do. We look at the cash and try to count it but RH’s like “no it’s $40 short.” So we’re not good under pressure so we end up giving the hostess $20 bucks each and the RH leaves. Now this didn’t sit well with us and our friends in the other car called us to see what was up. We all went back to argue our case but they said since it’s all cash there’s no proof. And basically said they are keeping the money. 

So we ended up paying $40 more and we are pissed, we go there at least once a month sometimes twice, and now we no longer want to go back because of the experience. ",1,Chased Down by a Rude Hostess,44

It involved a game of keep-away with prescribed medication, a customer who had to go without it for almost a week, and said customer having to go down a dark path just to find a resolution.

\#D = Doctor's Office

\#C = Pharmacy

\#R = Medication that the plot revolves around (Note: #R is NOT a narcotic or controlled substance)

I can't remember the specific conversations, but I called #C on Tuesday to refill some of my medications. 2 of them went through fine, but #R required an authorization to refill, as it had run out of refills. No big deal, I just had #C call #D to get the authorization, and was told there would be an update by Thursday.

Come Friday, and I, having not yet updated #C's contact information, called #C to check on my medications. 2 of them were ready. However, #R was not, and #C told me that they hadn't gotten any authorization from #D. This started to raise a few red flags. It was 3 days since I called the prescriptions in, and #R still hadn't gotten authorized? Curious, I called #D and was told that the refills were authorized, but I was to call #C and get them to re-send the refill request. So, I called #C again, and, guess what? They told me to call #D and ask what the hold-up was. Of course, by then, #D was closed for the weekend, so I basically went several days without the medication I needed.

Today, I called #D yet again to try and get something resolved. Yet again, I was told to contact #C if I had any problems.

Unfortunately for #D, my patience had run out by this point, and I had to start going angry customer mode, outright telling #D that I REFUSED to call #C, because they were going to tell me the same exact thing they've been telling me for almost a week, and I was no longer going to stand for it. The nurse at #D tried to tell me not to be rude and to take any of the problems I had to #C, but I was done chasing this wild goose. Eventually, the nurse said she was going to call #C, and I immediately went back to being nice and tried to apologize, though she hung up before I could. My dad, who was getting off from work, then stopped by #C to get whatever medications were available, and finally, #R had been refilled along with the other 2 medications.

744,splatgoestheblobfish,0,t3_afqev7,148,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/afqev7/you_actually_expect_a_tip/,"A couple weeks ago, my husband, mom, and I went to a local Mexican restaurant for a late dinner (about 8:30 pm; the restaurant closed at 10 pm.) and had a bad, very odd, experience.  We eat at this restaurant semi-regularly, and we’ve never had any problems. The food and the service has always been good. But for some reason, this night was different.

We were seated immediately, and a busser came over and brought us chips, salsa, and water. Very standard. But it was a full 10 minutes before our waiter came over, introduced himself, and took our order. Whatever. We figured he was probably busy. My husband and my mom both ordered taco salads with beef on them, and I ordered a small house salad with beef on it and a small order of nachos with just beans and cheese. We all also ordered sodas. Nothing very complicated. A busser quickly brought our sodas over. We waited for our food. And waited. And waited. It was taking an unusually long time, and after waiting 25 minutes, we tried to flag down our server.  No good. He kept walking right past us with at least his head, if not his whole body, turned away. As far as we could tell, he only had three other tables. He was paying attention to one of the tables (a family of three), and literally completely ignoring the rest of us. We tried calling him over, but he acted like he didn’t hear us. After 30 minutes, we were beginning to wonder if maybe he had forgotten to put in our order. We ordered salads and nachos. How long could that possibly take? The place wasn’t exceptionally busy. We even thought that there might something wrong in the kitchen. Maybe they were short-handed back there. But it was so weird that our waiter wouldn’t pay any attention to us at all and didn’t even update us on our meal status. There was one other waiter that we saw, and he was taking care of two tables at the far end of the section we were seated in, and he appeared to have the five tables in the section that connected to ours. We considered leaving, but my mom was insistent that if we left, we needed to get the bill for our drinks so we didn’t overpay, and we couldn’t get anyone’s attention for the bill.

Finally, after waiting for 35 minutes, the BARTENDER finally brought our food out and refilled our drinks. We immediately knew there was no problem in the kitchen. All three of our salads were warm, the beef on them was room temperature, and none of them had salad dressing on them. My nachos were actually cold, and the cheese was no longer stretchy and melty. Our food had obviously been sitting back there for a while and was just never brought out. We wanted to complain, so my husband got up to look for somebody, anybody. Apparently, the hostess was not at the front and the bartender was gone. It was like everyone in the restaurant had just vanished. So we grudgingly ate our meal, which obviously was not good. As we were eating, we see our waiter walk by again, serving the other table. We yelled, “Excuse me!” very loudly, but he never turned towards us. In fact, he turned the opposite direction and went back to the kitchen. However, the other waiter we had seen earlier DID hear us, and he came over to see what we needed. When he came over, we recognized him as a waiter we’ve had there several times before, and he has always been very good. (I don’t think he recognized us.) We told him we wanted to talk to the manager. He apologized and said the manager had already left about an hour ago for the evening, but he asked us what we were unhappy about, so we told him. He said there wasn’t much he had the authority to do, but he would do what he could for us. He brought us dressing for the salads (even though we were nearly done), and he was able to take our drinks off our bill. He also offered us free dessert, but we declined, as we didn’t want to spend any more time there. He apologized multiple times for our experience, though he didn’t offer any explanation for it. When we were finished, he promptly brought a to-go box and the bill. My husband paid by credit card, and wrote “$0—You really expect a tip?!” on the tip line. I think that’s the first time in my life I’ve never left a tip. However, on the way out, we caught the other waiter and gave him a cash tip and thanked him for helping us. As we were leaving, we passed by our waiter, and he didn’t acknowledge or even look at us.  Fortunately for the restaurant, we’ve been to this place enough times to know this was a very isolated incident, but it was still really weird. And for those wondering, I meant to call and speak to the manager the next day, but I got busy and completely forgot, and now it’s a little late, and I can’t even remember the guy’s name. But we’ll definitely talk up the other server next time we’re in!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Because it's been asked a couple of times, we weren't wearing anything that would typically be considered offensive. My mom and I were wearing solid color sweaters, my husband was wearing a button down shirt, and we were all wearing jeans. (Standard dress for this place.) But as I said, he was completely ignoring two of his other three tables as well. (The waiter who took over our care actually appeared to have taken over those tables as well before we left.) It was just a very bizarre night there. I do wonder if the manager had to leave early for some reason, and everything just fell apart thereafter. ",1,You ACTUALLY expect a tip?!,1278
745,dontbitemynose,0,t3_agi3lx,32,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/agi3lx/young_employee_cant_be_bothered/,"I stopped at a large 24 hour grocery/retailer tonight to pick up a few miscellaneous items. I entered on the grocery side and noticed there were no baskets so I asked a young man (somewhat greasy looking kid about 20 years old) where I could find one. He told me, somewhat curtly, that there might be some at the other entrance. I thought to myself how odd they'd have none stocked at my end seeing as how it was the only accessible entrance at that time of night. So I walked all the way to the other end, even though I needed nothing from that side (not a huge deal) and grabbed a bunch of baskets as a courtesy to bring back to the other end for other customers. (Being in customer service myself, I figured he would have offered to walk with me at the very least to grab some himself.) I saw the young man and said ""hey, I brought some extra baskets over to this side for ya"" to which he replied dismissively ""okay."" I paused and as he started to walk away I said ""you're welcome?"" No response. Then as I was checking out I saw him walk by again with a handful of more baskets. I told him ""oh hey, thank you for doing that."" No response. Maybe he didn't hear me? As he walked by again I made sure to make eye contact this time and said very sincerely ""thank you for doing that."" He completely ignored me and continued to walk by. At this point I realized his rudeness was not my imagination. So I got his name from a fellow employee and decided to write a review/fill out a survey through their website. I spend hundreds of dollars here every month and have never been treated this poorly before. I think a message needs to be passed along to his supervisor and a serious discussion needs to take place with him. Customer service is tough, I get that. But if one can't handle customer interactions and kindness, then he needs to consider another type of employment. I never complain but this experience really upset me. I had had a very long, hard day and the last thing I needed was to be met with such rudeness. I hope for his sake he was maybe also having a bad day and doesn't normally treat customers the way he treated me. I realize in the grand scheme of things worse things have happened but boy, was I mad. I've dealt with some really dumb kid employees there countless times but at least they're nice.  I've never been treated this way ever in all my years of shopping there. That's maybe why it got me so upset. ",1,Young employee can't be bothered,0

After everybody gave their requests she went around the table repeating the orders. She had to do it several times as she would try to give hot chocolate to someone. No one wanted hot chocolate.

A few months ago I was with some friends and we decided to order pizza. There was (emphasis on was) a popular pizza chain that I ordered from often and I knew I was only one pizza away from a free one and that was enough to convince me. Our order was simple, medium Hawaiian pan crust, no fancy bits no special extras
  
So I go ahead and order through the app like I always have and we sit down the watch a movie
Every now and then I glance at the clock to see how close it is to the promised time for the pizza to arrive, and when the time gets there I lock up my dogs so that they can’t run out the door and wait.
About 10 minutes go by and I’m starting to get a little concerned so I check the pizza tracker and it said my pizza hadn’t even been placed in the oven yet
Now I’m very reasonable so I think ‘hey maybe it’s just broken’ and resolve to give them another 15 minutes before I call up there
The 15 minutes comes and goes and still nothing. I call the place up to ask about my order and a guy on the line says “oh it’s cause we’re backed up”. This is a Tuesday night, there are no special promos going on. I’m confused. I ask “couldn’t you have called me to let me know about the wait? If I had known I’d be waiting nearly 2 hours for a pizza I would have cancelled it”
The dude responds with “well out manager usually tells us to but he’s not here.”
What? You need to be told to do something that’s common sense?

So I say fine but if the pizza isn’t here I’m 30 minutes I want to cancel the order.
So about 25 minutes go by, I’m irritated, my dogs have been locked up this whole time and they’re whining, my friends are starting to get ready to leave, and I hear a thump outside.
I look out the window to see the pizza delivery man had tried to pull into our drive way, missed, and ran over our trash can. 

I come out of the house furious now, I ask him what the hell he was doing. The dude gets out of the car and starts using sign language. Now I know sign language so I can understand him and he’s saying “I’m sorry, I didn’t see the curb” and I sign back “whose gonna pay for my trash can?” And he says that he’ll talk to the manager about getting me reimbursed
I know that’s bullshit, I don’t feel like fighting him. It was an old trash can that needed to be replaced anyway.
I take the pizza, I give him a 1 dollar tip and my friend tells me to watch him to make sure he doesn’t hit her car as he’s pulling away. 

I look out the window and this dude is talking on the phone on his way to the car??????

He gets in and drives off, I open the pizza box.
Not only were we given a cold pizza,(like it had been left out for 2 hours, wonder how that happened?/s) the whole thing was covered in jalapeños, which I am allergic to. I have never ordered from that chain again, not even to redeem that free pizza

TLDR; I waited 2 and a half hours for a pizza after the place forgot about us, the delivery man ran over my garbage can and pretended to be deaf because he thought that would get him out of it, and ultimately my pizza was covered with a topping I did not order and happen to be allergic to and I couldn’t even eat it",1,An incredibly awful pizza experience,66

They always book for value for money and normally score something decent for just over a hundred bucks a night.

Today I check in and am shown to my room: dishes haven't been finished and I notice the bathroom sink  is very filthy with a lot brown organic goop from the last hand washing. There is old soap around the basin. They guy tidied up the dishes and kitchen sink with a very old decrepit sponge. I mention the bathroom and he runs the goop with his hand to ""clean it"". He steps out.


Putting food items into the fridge, I see there are food spills and splatters that have attracted mould on every shelf.

Heading upstairs where I am to stay for the night I plonk my bag down. Folding back the covers I note the sheets have been changed but there is human stains on them that have not washed out, as have the pillow cases. I look down at the floor and there are chicken bone fragments on the carpet next to the bed. I stop down to get a closer look (from 1m up) and I get a whiff of the carpet... oh my. The 70 year old share house I used to stay had better smelling carpet. Under the bed are fragments of refuse and  what looks to be a spitball and a used tissue.

The rolled up brown towels on the bed have darker brown spots on them.

At that time I chose to get a look at the pillow under the pillow slip. The pillow inside is torn at one end, and has no white lining remaining on it whatsoever (why can't we post images here?).  OMG it's foul.

Heading back down to the bathroom to use the throne there is clear evidence of large patches (20mm) of dried pre pee on the seat.  I back out.

I pack up my stuff into the car and head to reception to check out. I've had possession of the room for maybe 20min.

At this time the guys asks why I've chosen to check out and I politely let him know why ... basically the room can't be cleaned to an acceptable standard - ever.

My first paragraph specifically says the pricing was average. It was just some newly opened restaurant trying to convince everyone it was high-end. 

So, I was attending a birthday dinner of a friend's at a somewhat mid-priced(pretty average rates for the food, keep this in mind) newly opened restaurant. 

I showed up, parked my motorcycle and stepped inside. I am a firm believer of ATGATT(All the (safety) gear, all the time) so I showed up in a pair of black formal trousers, full black boots, a full black motorcycle jacket, black gloves, my helmet in my hand and a formal dress shirt underneath. 

I was stopped by the front desk and told that I would not be allowed inside because ""This is a high end place, ok?"". Fine, whatever. I explain to the lady that I was planning on taking off my gloves and jacket(even though the jacket was a Dainese all black one with minimal logos that looked rather classy and ""normal""). No, she is still not convinced, and further repeats how this is a ""high end"" restaurant and they are very selective about customers who enter. Fine, whatever. I take off my jacket, my gloves and sort of place them inside my helmet, and hand them to another staff member for safekeeping while I get ready to join my friends' table. 

At this point, I am wearing the following clothes: A formal red dress shirt tucked into formal black trousers and my black boots. The lady gives me this look over, as if she is ""inspecting"" my clothes and sort of gives off an ""Ehhh, fine. Go inside."" 

This whole thing bothers me greatly, but whatever. 

I walk inside, and someone is escorting me to my table. On the way, I literally see that around 1/3rd of the customers are wearing casual  t-shirts with random stuff printed on them(logos, designs and whatnot) and/or jeans. There is even one guy sitting down with denim shorts. A lady is sitting down at another table with yoga pants and a hoodie, and the hood is up on her head. 

I lose it. I stop right where I am, a few steps away from my table where my friends are seated (looking at me) and insist that the guy escorting me to my table call the lady at the front desk inside. He gets confused, and asks why, I just repeat myself louder. Several tables are now looking at me, and the manager shows up. I explain to him that I want to see the lady at the front desk. He gets confused, but calls her in. 

I proceed to explain to the manager what happened. The lady tries to justify herself, and the manager ultimately sides with me. Lady apologises and 
 leaves, manager and other staff member who was escorting me to my table repeatedly apologise and offer my entire table a round of complimentary drinks as a way of ""apologising"" to me.

I genuinely have no idea why that one lady had some problem with me in particular.

Kenflunky Tried Chicken, it's systemically out of chicken, but lets start with the first real encounter, I was ""in training"" for a job in IT, phone based tech support, surrounded by people who thought mice were things you catch in traps.

&amp;#x200B;

We got a 30 minute lunch break. The facility (ex-hardware chain bldg), in the middle of being converted for our job (Sounds like Scream Informational), was directly across a main thoroughfare from Kenflunky Tried (5 lane- street, 2 lanes each way, 1 turn lane). It was day 3 of training, and I and a new coworker decided we'd brave the traffic, and get some good gravy and tasty fried chicken. We went in, there's a line at 11:00am 5 deep on 3 registers. Fine, we'll wait. It was maybe 5 minutes before we got to place our orders, nothing insane, 2 or 3 piece, 2 sides. After I pay, the woman at the register says ""We're out of chicken.""... nothing more. Just that.

&amp;#x200B;

Confused, I asked, does that mean you're out but you're making more? ""We'll give you a free frozen sundae.""... was the only response. I am pleased by this, but it did nothing to clarify whether we were going to get chicken, our main reason to be there. I know the staff are harassed, it's in a bad neighborhood, but nobody's trying to make shivs out of plastic forks that I can see. So I ask politely ""So there's more chicken, we just need to wait?""

&amp;#x200B;

""....""

Now, I'm not an expert at morse code, or telepathy (remember folks, tinfoil hats, keep the shiny side out, otherwise the alien mind control rays just funnel them directly into your brainpan!)... So I rephrase and repeat myself, does this mean the chicken is a lie? Or there will be chicken at some future point in time?

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, more chicken was being prepared, unfortunately, they were so backlogged with orders our 30 minute lunch window opened and closed before we got our orders. We paid, got no food, and some really weird vibes from the staff.

&amp;#x200B;

And I never got my free sundae. (that I didn't want to begin with, there's no crack in dairy)

&amp;#x200B;

Alas, as addicted as I am to Kenflunky McCracken Fried Cracken, we made 3 more attempts to secure that succulent chicken flesh with 13 secret herbs and crack, each time, same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Every branch of this big chain I've been to, you can't get an order without hearing ""we're out of"". God forbid I get a bucket. I've heard out of mashed potatoes, out of biskets (20 minute wait), almost always out of chicken-mcCracken.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: For fast fried chicken, they're pretty slow. Cashier waits until we pay to say ""We're out of chicken"", then we need an interpreter and an interrogator to find out if we can get our food.

Anyways...Let’s begin. This happened in 2006 when I was living in an apartment on the outskirts of the local Dice pizza’s delivery range (I was only 8 miles away to boot). So I decided one evening to order a pizza at about 5:45. So time passes and by 6:45 I’ve almost forgotten about the pizza I ordered. After giving a quick call to the shop to figure out what’s up I’m told that the pizza boy just left and it should be there shortly. Remember I’m 8 miles away in virtually a straight line up the road. 7:20 rolls around and I hear a knock at my door.  

My just under 20 dollar pizza is now there. Normally I tip well as I know the life of a pizza boy, but this one gave me attitude at the door so I simply said keep the change.

He was not pleased with his 36 cent tip. I didn’t care to be told where I could shove it. As he walked down my porch I noticed the twenty land on the step. He didn’t put it in his sleeve. So at least to be nice I shouted “Hey” and he responded with a quick “oh fudge off” as he figured my tip wasn’t up to snuff I guess. I grabbed my money and proceeded to microwave my ice cold pizza.

TLDR: ordered a pizza only to wait almost 2 hours for a rude pizza boy to drop the cash and insult me as he left.


Update: To be more clear the first thing I said when he got there was along the lines of “Finally” perhaps I was snarky, but oh well

His response was and I’ve remembered it to this day “ Dude, quit whining I got your damn pizza” as though my one call nearly an hour prior that lasted 38 seconds according to my call log was whining.

All seemingly went ok I traded my previous car in and left the dealership in my car, and that’s where the most infuriating car buying experience of my life began.

So the time comes to make my first payment, I’ve purchased this brand of car before, I knew the drill, already had an account with them, so imagine my surprise when the new car has not been added to my account. I check my previous car (which happened to be a lease, the new car brand was supposed to buy out) and nothing has been paid on that account. I call the dealership and they assured that it will be taken care of, they’ll investigate and get back to me. I call back a few times but get nowhere and am just told they are looking into it and I won’t be penalized for late payment and they’ll fix it with my previous lease (which is a brand under the umbrella of this company) life goes on and I get to the point my second payment is due, now being ghosted when I call dealership I’m starting to get mad.  I’m getting collection calls on my previous car, my credit report is being effected by the late payments. I even posted a negative review on the Facebook page because I wasn’t getting any answers.

One day I get a letter in the mail from the brand, my original offer on the new car was not accepted, I was really confused because I have now been driving the car 2 months, whatever deal I signed was the deal I made. So I call the dealership incessantly until I get the guy who had been handling my financing, he says he took care of it and just needed me to come in and sign some paperwork, I am skeptical but I just want to put this behind me (little did I know the worst was coming). So I go to sign, and the finance guy explains that my contract had a mistake, he made it for 39 months but it was supposed to be 36 months, so the brand rejected it, so all I have to do is resign the corrected form. He slides it in front of me to sign and doesn’t mention this is going to increase my payments $40 a month, so I called him on that. I ask why my payment went up and he tries to explain it like I’m 5 that fewer payments means that the money has to be added to the other months, I’m getting madder because it’s not that I don’t understand the concept, but it was his mistake not mine that created the issue, so why was I paying for it. I told him I agreed to the original price and signed and left the dealership with that price and I was not paying for his mistake, had I called back after I left wanting to lower the price they would have told me the same thing, that I signed a contract. 

Finance guy doesn’t say anything and leaves the room, I can hear yelling/loud talking so I can only assume his boss was not too pleased with his mistake. About 15-20 minutes later he comes back and seems down, but says the dealership is going to have to take the loss (getting even more mad, are you now trying to guilt me for your mistake that you already tried to pass off to me!?) then he has the audacity to mention my Facebook post and asks me to delete it since they fixed the mistake. I said I will absolutely not delete it because I’m still getting the run around but I will edit it to reflect that this is being resolved (or so I thought). 

So still mad about the situation, but glad to be done with it, life goes on... until a week later. I get a call from the manager of the financial dept. There is another mistake, since 2 months passed the dates were wrong, dumb ass finance guy had changed the paperwork to reflect new price but left it back dated to April, so the needed me to sign AGAIN. I let manager guy have it from how unethical finance guy had been, to the fact I was tired of coming to the dealership to fix their mistakes. He promises me a gift for my trouble (which btw I never got) promises that he will handle me personally when I come in we make a time appt and I hang up. I show up at agreed upon time and manager HAD THE WRONG TIME and says he can’t help me. So this other guy tries to help but is ridiculously patronizing and treats me like a child which pisses me off even more, he says he gets sent in with difficult situations because he is good at calming people down...  which makes me even more mad, so I sign new contract and again hope life goes on. 

I have talked to everyone I can within that company, even going to corporate. I can’t do much at this point, but I will NEVER do business with this car dealership again, side note, my family has been doing business with this dealership since I was a child, so they aren’t just losing me...and I don’t plan to use the brand either. In case you are wondering, I did in fact update my Facebook review and made sure it included all of the trouble I was put through, including being asked to delete my review.

757,Hyena_The,0,t3_afbasj,6,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/afbasj/delivery_service_has_no_integrity/,"I'm not going to name the delivery service because of the rules. I'll refer to the delivery business as DB. TL;DR Packages have been damaged in our apartments for a while now from the DB.

I order a subscription that delivers to my apartment monthly. Packages shipped to my apartment complex are usually stuffed into my mailbox. The mailbox compartment is a long and narrow horizontal tube seated tightly between the 12 other tubes for those who live in the complex with me, and those mailboxes are shoved into a corner against the wall by the door. There is a metal trough underneath the mailboxes that we use as a catch for mail that belongs to people who don't live there anymore. Outgoing mail has a labeled spot on top of the mailboxes. The design of the mailboxes is important later.

Previous DB affiliates and competitors know that all the packages that are too big to fit into the mailbox slots go to the main office for pick up. The main office has two big closets with padlocks so our items can be kept safe in case we aren't available. At the beginning of a round, a DB worker will pick up a master key so they have access to all the mailboxes and building entrances to our apartment complex. The DB worker will go around to each building, enter with the master door and mail box key, place mail where they need to, knock on doors of they need signatures, and return to the complex office with the keys and the packages that were too big for the mailboxes. 

Ive been living here for over a year and I never had an issue with any DB before until recently. It started with my neighbors talking about packages that were missing. Their online orders would be left at their doorstep with no knock or when notified about the package, there wouldn't be one. 

Today, I had my first own personal issue and it was gruesome. I had a notification about my package arriving in my mailbox. I was tired when I got home last night so I went straight to bed after work. This morning I wake up after my girlfriend has left, clean a little bit, and go down to get my package. It's not there. 

I notice there are a lot of brochures and Ads sitting in the metal trough instead of being put in our mailboxes. I don't think much of it then and assume the package will be there when the DB comes by today when it has more than just my package to deliver (I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt in case they really do care about their vehicles mileage). 

Girlfriend, who is pregnant, got to come home early after dropping some items on the floor at work. They told her to go straight home and come back after rest (thank goodness some businesses respect their employees). When she came home, I went downstairs to help her get upstairs. 7 packages of various sizes were in my way of the door at the foot of the stairs. After carefully inspecting, they appeared to be our neighbors! I moved them to the corner wondering where my package was. When my girlfriend walked in, she pointed up and I saw it was on top of the mailboxes is the outgoing area. When I picked it up, it looked like it had been opened and then tossed aside. Further inspection of the package and I saw that it had been cleanly cut open below the ""resealable"" package lining and a *single staple* held it together. The hole in the packaging wasn't covered at all. I was just glad that the product hadn't been taken out, damaged, or fallen. Logically, the manufacturer of my product wouldn't send a package out looking like this. 

I've been trying to call the DB about this to speak with someone. Nobody has been answering my calls to their office in my town. I have tried calling their corporate office and have an estimated 2+ hours of phone calls ahead of me (how is that even calculated?). The only person who is responsible for mistreating our packages in our apartment complex is the DB worker on duty right now and if their behavior isn't reprimanded appropriately (like being trained properly would be good), this will continue to happen and all of my neighbors, and possible other people, will have to deal with atrocious handling of our sensitive belongings. I feel very sorry for those who had lost packages during Christmas from loved ones because their packages were scattered all over the complex because of lack of integrity. 

I don't know who else to talk about this. I already plan on contacting my apartment complex office and letting them know that this has been going on for a while. ",1,Delivery Service has no Integrity,33

759,polite-1,0,t3_af7fv0,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/af7fv0/socks_are_underwear/,"This isn't really a negative experience, more of just a weird one.

I bought some stuff online from a global fast fashion chain that starts with a z and added a pair of socks to tick over to free shipping. The stuff arrives but it's the sizing and style are off so I go online and check their return policy. Underwear and swimwear are excluded and you can return for free via post or in-store. Great, I'll go in store because they've got a sale on and I'd rather try on the stuff in person.

So I take my stuff in and they return it no problem until they get to the socks (which are still in their original unopened/untouched packaging) and inform me that they can't be returned as per policy. ""No worries"", thinking that I probably misread the policy. Being out $9 for a single pair of socks sucks, but it isn't a big deal. 

I go browse, find some things and decide to check their return policy again and it's pretty explicit that only underwear and swimwear are excluded and that accessories are returnable if they're in the original packaging. So when I go to check out I ask if they're sure they can't return these socks, they're still in the original package, I only bought them for free shipping etc. and they again decline as policy. At this point I show them that their website only excludes underwear and swimwear from returns. Second cashier overhears and repeats the same thing, that socks are excluded and I show her, too, that accessories are allowed as long as they're in the original packaging. They then decide to ask a third staff member (possibly the manager) who says the same thing again. The original cashier then responds that the site only mentions underwear and swimwear as exclusions and its at this point the titular line is uttered ""Yes, but socks are underwear"".

I thought about it for a second but I honestly didn't know what to say. ""That doesn't make sense""? ""No, they're not""? Or just ""What?""? Either way I think I would have just sounded like a jerk and if they're really going to say something as nonsensical as socks are underwear then I doubt I'd get anywhere by arguing. Plus I knew I could return them via post pretty effortlessly. 

So I just said thanks and that I'll check with their support instead. Called up their customer line 5 minutes later and confirmed socks could indeed be returned and then just posted them back. ",1,Socks are underwear,99

I'm waiting at the Deli.  I'm #74; #71 and #72 are being served.  #73 is nowhere apparent as there's only three of us and two deli people.

**DeliGuy1** is helping **#71**; **DeliGuy2** is helping **#72**.  I'm standing two shopping cart widths away waiting my turn (and to stay out of the constant traffic out of the back room).

Another customer - we'll call her **SportsWoman** - comes up and yells across the counter at younger **DeliGuy1**.  (And please note I'm transcribing what she said as best I can and not trying to make fun.)

**Sportswoman**:  ""Y'all sellin' those (Sports Team) balloons?""

**DeliGuy1** *stutter-steps as he's slicing and it wouldn't have been pretty*:  I'm sorry ma'am, if there's no price, it's probably not for sale.

**SportsWoman**:  Awh whaddYOO know anyway, you just a kid.  *She turns to* **DeliGuy2**.  Yo!  How much for the balloons?

**DeliGuy2**:  I'm sorry ma'am, as my coworker said, if they're not priced, they're not for sale.

**SportsWoman**:  Wha doyou all know anyway, if they hangin they be sellin.

She then starts moving from my far left (the dairy section, a good 80 feet away) halfway down the store to the in-store salad bar (a good 150+ feet away) and collects **every. single. sports team. balloon** from every single display, table, and shelf.

She disappears around the corner with over a dozen helmet, jersey, and football-shaped ~~nylon~~ mylar balloons.

The two **Deliguy**s stare at each other for a long moment but finish the orders for **#71 and #72** and process me as well.

Later, I'm finishing up my final checkout and as I'm walking past Customer Service, I hear one of the ladies behind the counter saying,

TLDR; phone company bullies us into buying something in store. Customer Service rep says mail it for a refund. Cool. But no, Just kidding fuck you. No refund &amp; all returns are final so no item back either. 

About a month ago I went to my phone store to upgrade my device. Everything was awesome. The trade in value of our (mine and husbands) old phones covered the sales tax and on of the cases we picked out. We were giddy. Then the rep asks if we’ll need screen protectors. 

Sure why not? 

Because they’re $50 screen protectors that’s why the fuck not. Who? Who in their right mind even imagines that a screen protector, that thing you can grab for $4 at the checkout counter of any super market would be $50?!?! 
He didn’t disclose this until we went to pay. We were wrangling a toddler and I genuinely think he saw an opening to trap us into a high bill. Turns out he can’t remove them once their on the phone and he can’t remove them from our bill. We argue for a few minutes but he stands firm. We walk out of there with $50 glass on our phones and no cases because we couldn’t afford the cases on top of that ridiculous bill. 

So I contact big phone companies customer service and I’m told NO PROBLEM ship us the item and we’ll refund you!! 

Okay phew! Great! 
Two weeks go by and no word on the item. Check the tracking number and it’s definitely arrived at the return facility. 
So I get back in touch with them. 
This rep says they see the issue and not to worry. She starts talking about a “tax refund”. I tell her I’m waiting on a refund for an item I returned. She says “Oh I see that.” And then tells me I can expect my refund in 5-7 days. 
This was on Christmas Eve so I knew that it would be more like 10/11 with holidays and weekends. So I waited until at least 7 *business* days had passed and got ahold of them again. 

Now I’m told they can’t issue refund to my debt card despite the fact that I’ve been told they can numerous times. The rep says he can offer $75 credit toward my bill. I say: “I was really hoping for this be refunded to my card. This is really frustrating. Is there any way to make this happen at all?” 

He transfers me to a manager who tells me the credit towards my bill was a one time offer and she can’t do that anymore. When I ask for the item back, first she tells me that all returns are final. Then she tries to tell me she can’t even find the item with tracking number I give her and just stonewalls the hell out of me. 

I have transcripts of all of these conversations emailed to myself. I’m just so fucking pissed. 

Like what the fuck?? 


update: so I called customer service and spoke to a lovely lady. She helped apply the amount to my account. It took like 10 minutes. She read the transcripts of the conversations I had with previous reps and immediately helped me which gave me the feeling that she knew the previous reps were in the wrong. I want to be done with the whole thing but I plan on looking into a different phone provider. Once I’ve done that I plan on contacting someone at the company via social media and outlining this ridiculous experience and how it lost my business. I’ve used this provider for three years. This recent upgrade make 4 incredibly expensive devises I’ve purchased from them. So hopefully they take it to heart. 

Thank you everyone for your advise. Just being able to vent about the situation helped me process and stay calm &amp; kind enough to get this resolved. ",1,So I thing I just got robbed by a phone company??,832

The chicken tenders (kid's meal) came with either fruit or fries and I was having trouble deciding, flip-flopping back and forth when the waitress said ""Do you want them both?"" and I said ""Well is it extra?"" and she shook her head and said with a knowing look ""I'll just type it in"". I thanked her, filled out the receipt with a $1.00 tip and then I looked at the itemized and saw that she had charged me $1.00 to add fruit.

I called her over and called her out on that because, you know, she very heavily insinuated that there wouldn't be an extra charge, and she acted incredulous that I expected it for free. She first said that the meal came with fries and of course the fruit would be extra, and I was like well I didn't want both of them enough to pay extra, so I'll just have the fries, and then she said that the kids meals don't come with fruit, which is why she got confused, so I showed her the menu where it very clearly said ""served with fries or fruit"" and then it was all a blur where her last and final excuse was that the non-kids meal sandwiches come with either fruit or fries and then she took my card and (I hope) refunded the first order and re-ran it for the correct amount.

Did this lady just try to hustle me??? I still tipped her $1.00 even though I normally don't tip on takeout but after thinking about it on and off I feel like I got taken.

She went to look at the discounted holiday stuff while I got in line at the pharmacy counter.  There was a gentleman at the counter and another in line before me.  After a moment the gentleman in line left and I stepped up, wondering if I should also leave the line and come back. 

A woman who was talking on her phone came and stood next to me. I prepared to be assertive as I wasn't sure whether she had realized that I was in line.  (I was the only person in line when she approached).  

The gentleman finished his transaction and the woman turned to me, clearly aware that I was waiting and expecting me to let her go ahead ""I already waited in line before."" I said, ""yes, but I've been waiting in this line and you were not here.  You have to wait again."". She reiterated that she had ALREADY waited, earlier, and appealed to the pharmacy tech to back her up.  Pharmacy tech confirmed that her earlier waiting did not satisfy her waiting requirement for the entire day and called me forward.  

Pharmacy tech began the process of getting my prescription and commended me on the way I handled the situation.  She then informed me that this customer's entitled behavior is not new and told me about a time that she asked Pharmacy staff to have someone move from a chair she had previously been sitting in and had vacated.  

I asked about my mothers' prescriptions, not realizing it would have been more efficient to give all the names at once, and my mom appeared at my side to introduce me to the tech as her daughter, and to tell me not  to worry about her scripts, that she would wait in line herself.

So a few years ago my mom was looking at buying a new truck. Being the habitual worrier that she is, she had the financing already planned out a week before going to the dealership. So finally after a week of getting everything planned out we head into the dealership. 

Everything is going perfectly they have the truck she wants (no power anything, base model, good price) so we head into the salesman’s office to start finalizing things, this is where things get stupid. Salesman will be S: mom will be M: 

S: So have you looked at financing options yet I can get you a really good deal.

M: Yes I already have financing setup and I’m pre approved for X amount 

S: Well I’m sure I can get you a better deal

M: No thank you, I like this company and I don’t want my information given out to all these companies

My mom knew he wouldn’t find a better deal because she had done her homework before hand but annoying salesman wasn’t having any of that. So this goes back and forth for over an hour with the salesman just flat out ignoring my mom and insisting that he knew better and we were going to be getting ripped off etc. Finally my mom is worn down and just says whatever to get this over with.

Turns out the guy couldn’t get my mom a lower percent so he just wasted a ton of our time. The cherry on top was the fact that 3 of the companies he applied to had a data breach within a couples years and my moms information  was exposed.

We arrived around 9:30/10 PM because I work late but they’re open til 2 AM so we figured it would be safe for us to hang out for quite a while. We specifically asked for separate checks, ordered a round of drinks, two of us got food, and we started catching up.

Our mixed drinks took a while to get to us, and when they finally arrived the waiter apologized and said the bartender just quit in a huff so he had to go back and make our drinks for us, trying to find all the recipes so he knew what quantities of which substances to use for the more complex cocktails. We told him it wasn’t a problem and ended up staying until almost 1:30, ordering 4-5 more drinks each, including one amazingly strong strawberry mojito after the special pouring tip on the bottle fell out while he was making it. He was a great guy in general, checked up on us regularly and cracked jokes as he walked past. 

At the end of the night as they were starting to close up, our waiter came by to drop the check. Singular. We asked again if we could get separate checks but he winked and said “You don’t need to worry about separate checks. Every night I pick a lucky table” and he walked away. We looked at the bill, and the only thing he charged us for was my chicken Caesar salad and my friends burger. We left him a $40 tip. Best birthday outing ever!

EDIT: Wow guys, thanks for blowing up the comments! I didn’t realize this post would be such a big deal. 

To clarify a few things, we were at a large American chain restaurant with an acronym name. Not exactly high brow dining. The salad was $10 and the burger was like $12. The drinks were in the $5-7 range, and one of my friends was driving and only had two. 

We are also young and female. I don’t really believe that this guy picks a table every single night. That kind of thing gets noticed (if he doesn’t ask for/have permission to do it) and isn’t good for revenue (if he does get permission to do it). I think he saw a couple of young women out celebrating and decided to go the extra mile. 

This sort of thing has never happened to us before, even though two of us have worked in the service industry before. We originally asked for separate checks because we needed to put it on our credit cards. We didn’t have enough cash between us to tip what would have been the whole bill even if we wanted to. Thank you all for your input on the percentage of the tip! If this ever happens again, I hope to have enough cash on hand to properly express our appreciation. I absolutely think it’s appalling that the food service industry pays so little that you have to rely on the kindness and generosity of strangers, but we left easily the tip we would have left on the final bill, which couldn’t have been more than $120.

I realize this sort of move isn’t great for business but it does happen on occasion. I can’t speculate on whether the waiter talked to someone to get permission or had a code he could apply himself or just didn’t ring things up. I just took it as a kind gesture to make my friend’s birthday a great night.

He was the dentist I have had since I was 13/14. I'm super happy for him, he was a great guy and he will be missed. They hired a new person to take his place, she's young and I was excited to meet her. Hopefully she is a great as my previous dentist. 

I go to the dentist early to fill out the insurance paperwork and I go and sit in the waiting room, but I noticed on my sheet that it says ""temp hygienist"" which is concerning, because I had made the appointment with my normal hygienist six months prior. I figured she might have left when the dentist left. Nope. They stuck me with a random temp hygienist, who used a teeth power washer to clean my teeth, nicking my gums on the way. I flinch and she just assumes I have sensitive teeth and told me I should use a specific sensitive tooth paste. Sure, I probably should since some are cold sensitive. I get the usual lecture that I need to floss more often

Anyway, we get to the new dentist. I meet her and she takes 2 minutes to look at my teeth. Looks at the ones that have been on a watch list for about four years now and tells the hygienist which teeth they are, and leaves. Cool. I usually get told that I have great teeth and blah blah blah (s/o braces and good oral hygiene). But whatever, she's new and has taken over a beloved dentist's patients, probably a little overwhelming. Anyway, we set up the next cleaning appointment and then I get told I have to have a treatment appointment. And at this point I'm confused. I ask what treatment? The temp tells me I have to get two teeth filled. And I am shocked, because why wouldn't my dentist tell me this when I am in the chair. Why wouldn't she sit down and walk me through the fact I have to get fillings and where I have to get them? So I am pissed. 

She drops me off at the front desk and I burst into tears. I never really understood how attached you get to certain people in your life, but man oh man did I want my old dentist back. He never would have been so short, he would have made sure to walk me through it and made sure that I knew what was happening. I know its just two fillings, but its also costs money and I am (in my mother's words) rent poor. I make enough money for rent and bills but not much gets put into savings. 

The front desk lady was so nice, she let me complain about it, and how I just found out I had to get fillings. She realizes that I had a bad experience with the new dentist and tells me she is gonna make the appointment with a different dentist, one that is similar to my old one in his mannerisms and bedside manner and that since I don't think its that pressing of an issue, she made it for two months down the road so I can make sure I am covered. And if I like the new dentist, I can make him my regular one. 

All I have to say is shout out that lovely front desk lady who made me feel validated in my feelings and didn't make me feel dumb for crying in the dentist office as a 24 year old.

The very next woman in line got up to the register, and after the employee told her it would just be another minute or so, she pulled something out of her pocket and set it down next to the register, saying ""I understand, I'm sorry you have to deal with people like him. You guys can just use this to cover your costs for whatever you can't ring in, and put the rest in as a tip."" The employees looked at her for a couple of seconds, seemingly confused, and asked ""are you sure?"" The woman said ""absolutely - just use this when your system is back up to pay for mine and whatever else you end up giving away, and the rest is yours.""

I got up to the register, looked at what the woman had placed on the counter, and saw a $50 Visa gift card. Sadly, though, the register was back up and running, so no free food for me.",1,"Customer irate over power outage, next customer severely overpays for a sandwich",798

Their baggage allowance limit is 15Kg check in and a 7kg carry on. 


At home, I have a very accurate set of digital scales that reference to 2 decimal points. My father in law gave them to me as a gift as he  knows I am into ultralight hiking and am a confessed gram counter. When I left home, my check in baggage weighed 14.78kg.


It's my turn to check in and have my bag weighed etc. I put my bag on the scales, hand in my ID and nominate my destination. The early twenties operator tells me that my bag is over 15kg and I must sign a form acknowledging that I agree the bag will be sent on the next available flight which could be up to a few days away.


I'm perplexed. I politely tell her I refuse to sign the form as the bag weighs less than and not greater than the weight limit, thus signing the form would be an admission that my maths degree was invalid. While explaining this and glancing about, I notice that there is a display on the counter showing my bag weighs in at 14.78kg. I point this out to the operator and she says “we round up”. 


I let her know even with rounding up it's still not greater than 15kg … and ask her to deal with it as she chooses. 


Later, in the departure waiting room I call their head office and sort the issue out. My bag arrives on the same flight.

2 parties, me and the seller were basically ghosted by the delivery company for 8 weeks.  


Here we go, so I'm a HUGE fan of a game franchise and this game franchise released a (rather meh) game recently but I still love the aesthetic and lore of the franchise. So much so, I spent £140 on a Pre-order of a prop model from the newest game.  
So November 14th rolled around, the game released and the related merch was shipped out. Then less than a week later I get the hoodie I ordered, that was shipped out after the prop... I thought this was weird and went to check the tracking  
Checking the tracking I saw that on the 14th of Nov the item was shipped, it was then misrouted, rerouted and sat in Hagen Germany for that week. I thought that was weird but maybe it'll just be a little bit late.  


another week goes by and I check the tracking, nothing changed. I try to contact the delivery company to find answered but not only was their site in German (since it wasn't in the UK) it required information from the sender in order to go through customer support, plus the chatbot only spoke German.  
This is where I contacted the seller and asked them if they could contact the company and get some answers.  
2 more weeks go by and I ask the seller for a refund or a replacement and place the blame solely on this delivery company. They say they'll contact me when the company gets back to them.   


Merry Christmas.  
Happy new year.   
It's now 2019, the package still hadn't arrived so a few days ago I sent the seller another email basically saying I want a refund or a replacement and they should really be getting angry at the company that's buggering over their customers.  
I get no reply.  


Then today, Jan 9th, I hear a knock on the door, I sleep in till like 1pm most days because I'm unemployed, I look out the window in a dazed mess and see the UK delivery company which is now owned by the shipping company and I'm wondering if it's my prop. Sure enough, it gets delivered to a neighbor because I'm tired as shit. Then the neighbor goes out to do some shopping so I couldn't get my package. We finally get it and lo-and-behold it's my prop! Written on the box was 'won't scan'

So not only was the delivery 8 weeks late, the tracking never updated and they never contacted the seller to explain the scanning problem they're having so they could relay it to me. So all in all, I hope the seller switches shipping companies.   


p.s. The prop looks AWESOME.

Anyway, I was walking through a nearby city having some time to kill before going to meet a friend. I am pretty familiar with the city centre and sometimes like to take a ""detour"" to pass some concept stores to see if they have anything unusual and cool in stock. 

As I was walking, I noticed a man standing on the sidewalk. Nothing strange, so I kept walking until he approached me. He wasn't wearing any branded attire or formal clothes so I assumed it was just a guy wanting to ask directions.

&gt;Guy: Hey how are you doing?

&gt;Me: Doing fine, thanks.

&gt;Guy: Do you have a few minutes?

Now, I happened to have visited this store before and figured that if the guy wasn't legit, I could always ask a staff member for help so I agreed.

It turns out that there actually WAS an Icecream tasting test going on. I got two of them and they paid me with a delicious full-sized chocolate bar.

I'll get some food and something to drink, but it's cheaper than getting a lyft home, and I don't exactly know my way around. The manager is totally fine with it, too. He's even said to me on multiple occasions for me to stay as long as I want, until they close the lobby ofc. And I usually bop about an hour before they close.

Once, though, a guy I didn't recognize was working. Super friendly and adorable. I went about my business... Until he started wiping down the table in front of mine.
Edit: He hadn't been wiping down tables before this, either. And didn't continue after this.

Before I continue. I'm bad at social shit. I don't realize when I'm being hit on until it's too late. My husband finds it hilarious. And it leads to stuff like this.

I had headphones on, and was deep in some shit on Undertale. I heard his voice, so I pointed at myself to kinda be like ""talking to me?""

He nodded, so I moved my headphones off and he said hey... And immediately ""You wouldn't happen to be seeing anyone, would you?""

I lit up, as I do. My husband and I have been together since we were thirteen, we're twenty-one now, and honestly, our life is amazing together. We gush about each other a lot as soon as anyone asks about stuff like that, usually when we meet new friends we mention it to kinda clear the water that all affection is Immediately platonic.

I held out my engagement/wedding ring (I didn't wanna exchange it for a wedding ring, plus that's REALLY expensive and this has been with me since our freshman year of college), and ""yes!!! I'm actually waiting for my [husband] (at the time fiance, it's been a few months) to get off work!""

He just kinda. Looked downtrodden, said ""oh"" very softly, and finished cleaning that table before going back to the front. Didn't see or hear from em for the rest of the night.

I realized about five minutes after he walked away that he was probably asking for a date.

I felt so bad, but this is still one of the funniest things to have happened while waiting on my husband. All because I'm autistic and can't tell when I'm being hit on.
My husband was cackling and losing his shit when I told him, ""That pOOR GUY BABE, OH NO,""

I went to the local branch of their discount chain (red and black text on yellow background). Their matching policy, taken directly from the flyer, is:

We match identical items defined as same brand, item type (in the case of produce, meat and bakery), size and attributes, or comparable items in the case of private label.

Note what it says about private label (another term for store brand). This family of chains has two private labels: ""anonymous"" (black text on yellow, no pictures), and a ""premium"" brand, ""Trump's Preference"" (has pictures, looks pretty much like a brand name product). Some items are offered under one label, some under the other, and some under both. I can understand matching another store's private label with ""anonymous"" if the product is sold in both of their private labels, or only matching private labels with ""anonymous"" (so if they only carry it in ""Trump's Preference"", no matching).

Competing discount grocery chain (yellow text on green background) had a really good sale on ""choice"" chicken hot dogs (their private label). Red/yellow/black is closer, so I went there. Picked out some ""anonymous"" chicken hot dogs, had yellow/green flyer. Cashier checked with manager, ""we don't price match 'choice'"". That's not what their written policy says.

This happened a few years ago, I was on a school trip, and one night we had dinner at a local pub. When it was my turn to order, I did my usual speech of what I'm allergic to, and the waitress took it all down. 
I get my food (a chicken and bacon burger), but it has this white sauce all over it and the side of chips. Since I don't really want to die, I ask my friend to taste it first, and she says it tastes very tangy and it probably has lemon. Ok, pain in the ass, but it's still early, I can get a new one made. 

I take it back over to the counter and tell the waitress what's wrong. She apologises a lot, and goes get the chef. 

Chef: ""what's wrong with the food""

Me: ""I'm allergic to citrus, and I don't think I can eat this""

Chef: ""there's nothin' in it""

Me: (taking no risks, and I'm surprised how confident my 15 year old self was) ""can you please list the ingredients in the sauce please""

Me: ""lemon is citrus""

Chef: ....

Me: ""I can't eat this, I'll be sick""

Chef: ""are you sure?""

Me: ""....yes...lemon is citrus...I'm allergic""

776,aKamikazePilot,0,t3_adz46r,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/adz46r/former_bossmanager_hid_in_the_break_room_once_he/,"Hello readers! To start off, I gotta provide some background info (cut down as much as possible). For about 3 years I worked at a hardware store in my hometown during summer and winter breaks from school. I worked as a sales associate making minimum wage until my 2nd/3rd year (not great), but it was very close to home and I got along with all my coworkers, except for one.

It was my manager, who I'll call ""G"". At first, G was pretty nice and I got along with him. However, after about 1-2 months, he became very snippy and annoyed over the littlest things. One of the younger managers that I came to know even wrote a long 2-week notice letter to the owner specifically calling G out as a reason for leaving.

By my 3rd year, I had pretty much had it with G. One specific story I have was when I was doing receiving in the back. A call was made for cement, and with it being 2 feet away from me I called over that I could get it. However, G called and said that he would get it, basically ignoring my call and saying he'll just do it. He came to the back and grabbed it while having a crappy attitude and ignoring me. He was like this the rest of the day and on (probably wanted a reason to be in a bad mood).

I then found a job working at a larger retailer that also had a hardware section and turned in my 2 weeks, where I have been working for the past 7 months. Yesterday though, I needed to grab fire starters and didn't want to drive across town, so I went to my former workplace now as a customer (it also gave me a reason to talk to my former coworkers and see how they're doing).

I get there and talk to them for several minutes, where one of them walks with me while I grab the fire starters. As the two of us were then walking towards the front of the store, G pops out from the break room, spots me walking up, and heads straight back to the break room. Both me and the coworker just stare at each other and shake our heads, where I say ""After 7 months you would think he would be over it"".

We talk a few more minutes a couple aisles away from the break room, and G never popped out (He wasn't on lunch because he always eats at his desk right outside the door and never stays in the break room for more than a few minutes). It was comical to see that after all this time he couldn't buck up and say hi or even just walk around and do his own thing.",1,Former boss/manager hid in the break room once he saw me,129

I went to close my tab at around 1:30 AM since I had to work at 10 that morning. The bartender rummaged around in the cash register for a while before coming back to tell me she couldn't find my card. 

At first I was understanding, but her mood soured right away when I made it clear I wasn't going to say ""oh well"" and leave. I think she was hoping I would drunkenly forget about it, but I went easy that night knowing I had to be up for work so I was pretty sober. 

I also want to add here that I'm a retail manager for a luxury brand and have extreme patience. It takes a lot for a customer to ruffle me at work, so I was making sure to be diplomatic and give the bartender the benefit of the doubt so we could resolve the problem together. 

Yeah, no. I'll be M, she'll be B.

B: These things happen. 

M: Can you help me understand how my credit card could disappear from a cash register? It's not making sense to me. What's the policy in place for when this happens?

B: I don't know. This has never happened before. You can cancel the card and open a new one though, it's no problem. 

M: Well, it is a problem because that is majorly inconvenient for me, plus I won't have access to money until I get my credit card back. Is there any way you can cancel the tab as a courtesy? 

B: The charges already went through and the tab is closed, so I can't undo it. 

M: Who authorized that? I didn't close it or sign for it. Is there a chance someone else closed it?

B: Can I check your purse? You probably have it and just forgot you closed the tab. 

She smirked at me, legitimately smirked. Again… I wasn't drunk. I didn't close my tab and forget it. I showed her my purse anyway to assuage that thought. 

We spent another ten minutes going back and forth, with her leaving twice to talk to the owner after telling me she ""didn't have time to check it out thoroughly"". At that point, I straight up told her she better find time. The second time, I asked to talk to the owner myself (he happens to love my sports franchise and I wasn't afraid to play that card) but she wouldn't let me. 

B came back the second time and gave me this giant sour look. 

B: YOU'RE WELCOME. 

M: …okay, I'll bite. For what? (I was tired and cranky at this point)

B: I couldn't find YOUR credit card so now the charge for YOUR tab is coming out of MY tips at the end of the night. 

M: Honestly, I don't feel bad since *you* lost my credit card. This is not my fault in the slightest. And I thought the charge already went through. 

At this point, my boyfriend was ready to jump behind the bar. A male bartender gave him a defensive ""chill out dude, this happens all the time."" My boyfriend shot back that if that was true, they had a huge problem on their hands (love him). 

I gave up and called a Lyft home. The driver told my bf and I that her card had been lost at that bar and the same thing had happened to a friend. Go figure. I guess they're notorious for it. 

We got into my bf's driveway and I got a call from the bartender. I let it go to voicemail and she left a very smug message telling me that the card had been in the register ""right where it should've been"" stuck to another card the whole time and I could come get it. 

The bar/restaurant was closed New Year's Day so I still was without my card until the following day. I went in and spoke to a manager. Evidently my card was charged but she's working on getting the charge reversed. I'm still waiting on that. There was no suspicious activity though and they locked the card in their office so I didn't have to cancel and get a new one.

She fell in love with it.  She liked the steak, the ability to pick about 100 different things and of course above all else the giant dessert buffet.

We don't go often because the ones around us aren't that great and it doesn't agree with my wife.

Finally though my daughter put on the puppy dog eyes and got us to go yesterday. (shes 5)

We had to wait for my wife to get off work, so I went to the website and looked it up to make sure they didn't close early on sundays.  They close according to the site at 10, we should arrive around 8.  Thats more than enough time.

We walk in at 8:10 and the girl working the counter as she finishes ringing out the people ahead of us looks up and loudly says ""JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE CLOSE AT 9!""

I replied, ""huh, your website says 10.""  She replied back ""No thats only saturdays."" I said ""Oh okay, well you may want to have them change your website because it says sundays too.""  I wasn't being argumentative, just trying to let them know, she didn't appreciate that either and told me ""I don't control the website.""

Well no shit, but I figured she could tell someone like a manager who could get it fixed.  Any large company I've ever worked at had a way to contact corporate if something was incorrect, especially something as important as hours.

To be honest though the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way, we didn't casually stroll in at 8:45 to a sitdown restaurant.  We showed up to a buffet where the food is already prepped 50 minutes before they close.  This is more than enough time to eat.  Or so we thought.

Once we were rang out we went and sat down our coats and stuff and went up with my daughter and got our food.  We sat back down a minute or two before 8:20.  We realized there wasn't any silverware and went looking only to find there wasn't a single clean fork in the place.

At this time I took a quick look around and noted that 3 more tables had come in after us and the people who were in front of us were looking for forks too.

I asked our server if she could get us a fork, she replied with ""They should be here"" pointing down at an empty container, she looked and said ""you might want to look on the other side"" and pointed across the vast chasm of Holdin Morale at the other plate and silverware station.

Oh Yay was the chasm vast and wide the entire 25 feet was obviously too far to see that it was clearly empty. I humored her anyway since she had made it clear by pointing at two obviously empty containers that she was not getting me a fork.

I looked in the second container and like I or anyone with an eyesight that doesn't require a guide dog could see it was empty.

I walked back and told her  there was nothing in there either, to which she replied ""I guess I'll have to check the kitchen.""

I sat back down and stared at my food which pretty much all required a fork to eat and waited.  5 or so minutes pass and she walks past us again and starts clearing plates from a table, my wife and I both kind of looked around, and I even stood up to look and make sure she hadn't restocked the forks.

She looked at me and said ""What you haven't got forks yet?""

My jaw dropped and I just calmly replied ""Uhhhh no.""

She walked away carrying her plates etc and my wife got up and followed her to find out they had restocked the other side (that we could not see while sitting).  So we waited a solid 10 minutes total total from when we got our food to finally get a fork.  Of course by this point our food was all somewhere between luke warm and cold.

Heres the thing I know someone is going to pop into comments with ""Its Holdin Morale what do you expect?""  and the answer is ""Not much"" I expect the food to be okay, the service to be mediocre and to have a friggin fork.

The food probably would have been okay if it was hot, the service was awful and there wasn't a fork in sight.",1,JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE CLOSE AT 9!,439
786,Satan360100,0,t3_adevrn,67,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/adevrn/two_different_incorrectly_made_burgers_from_the/,"So this happened to me a week or so ago. I work in a call center which is near to a fairly big sized mall in our city. Because of this, I like to go to the food court on my lunch breaks to pick up something cheap/quick when I can't be asked to make myself a lunch. 

It's about 6:30PM on a weekday, half an hour before the food court closes and I go on lunch. I go to the Royal Burger store because I want to try their newish Royal Mushroom and Swiss. The ""Royal"" series of burgers comes with two patties and bacon, it's about as close to a ""Premium"" burger that Royal Burgers gets.  

I'm feeling hungry today so my order consists of a Royal Mushroom and Swiss, a Royal Chicken Burger with no cheese (Their cheddar is really bad) and a Cola. Well they're out of Cola so I get an orange soda instead. Cool. 

After waiting 15 minutes to get my food (This location was notorious for being slow) I ensure both burgers are there and I have my drink and job back to work. I get back to my work station and open the chicken. Covered in cheese. Normally this isn't an issue, just suck it up and eat it right? I would but the cheddar cheese from this franchise is straight up bad, it's the most off brand knockoff of processed american cheese slices you can find. 

I went back. Told the manager (Who was fantastic by the way) about the issue with the burger. I also had my receipt but they recognized me from 5 minutes earlier. Get a new Chicken and go on my merry way. Back at work, I sit down. Eat my chicken, pass the drink off to my work friend as it's not my favourite flavor. Open the Royal Swiss. It's bad. No bacon at all. One patty. Only half of it had mushrooms which is weird in its own right. 

Now I'm 5 minutes over my mandated 30 minute lunch break at this point. But it's the principal of the thing and my manager is pretty chill. Explained what happened to him and he signed off on some ""Personal"" time for me to sort it out. 

I went back. The manager of the store greeted me when I walked up, she'd seen me when I was dealing with the chicken. The first words out of my mouth was ""I'm sorry"" in true Canadian fashion. I explained the situation to the manager off to the side, she informed me that they were training a new cook. Cool. I truely hope he wasn't fired over it and he can learn from the experience. 

At this point the manager herself hopped on the grill and made my burger perfectly. She also doubled the bacon which is a plus. In the end I lost about half an hour off my paid hours, but it was the principle of the thing. Also the ""Royal"" series of burgers aren't the cheapest thing on their menu and if I was paying for a pseudo-premium burger, I wanted my money's worth. I'm definitely going back next week, when made properly it was a pretty good burger.",1,Two different incorrectly made burgers from the same place at the same time.,906
787,blungosphere,0,t3_adjrt7,12,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/adjrt7/mattress_delivery_goes_awry/,"I bought a high end king size mattress with adjustable base from a well known US mattress retailer.  They set up delivery for the next day.

Sure enough, the next day the delivery driver and his assist arrive, actually before the scheduled time.  Let's get this baby setup and put it to use!

Delivery guys take the old mattress and box spring (also King), and sets up the adjustable base.  Now we just need the mattress.  that's where things started to go awry.

Turns out they cannot get the new mattress up the stairs.  After breaking a window blind, knocking pictures off the wall, they tell me they can't get the mattress where it needs to be.  

OK, life happens I guess this isn't going to work.  No biggee, please return to the store and I'll figure something else out.  Oh no, says the delivery person, we have to leave the adjustable base here.  WTF?  No, that isn't happening, if I can't get the mattress I don't want the base.  Frantic phone calls to the ""dispatcher"" result in them grudgingly agreeing to take the adjustable base away, and bring the original mattress back in.  Delivery guys decide to go full surly.  

They bring back the original mattress and box spring, now covered in leaves and dirt because they just tossed it down in my front yard.  They dump it in my bedroom and storm out.  I look outside and see their packing materials strewn across the road in front of my house and they are starting their truck to drive away.  I hurry outside and stop them and tell them to pick up their trash.  As the driver gets out of the truck I start taking pictures of all the trash to document this shit show.  The driver doesn't like that and under his breath says ""fuckin' dickhead.""  I ask the driver what he said and be begins shouting, ""FUCKING DICKHEAD, FUCKING DICKHEAD, FUCKING DICKHEAD!!!!""

So, in order to save time for all you aspiring mattress delivery drivers, here's a pro tip; make sure the mattress fits before you have to meltdown in public because of your own stupidity.

I’ve been going through a difficult time recently so when the store manager accused me of swapping the headset out for another it pushed me over the edge and I broke down crying. I understand her reasoning but it’s a horrible feeling to be accused of something you didn’t do and have no proof otherwise, I just felt hopeless. I’m so embarrassed about it but I just found out that it’s normal for the serial numbers not to match anyway as the box, headset and controller have unique but very similar numbers... the store should have been aware of that!

For those who don’t know the keys are a small couple of islands on the coast of Florida that are very similar to the Bahamas, or nicer parts of Hawaii. On our first day there we decided to get breakfast since we where pretty hungry so we decided to go to a small cafe. upon walking into the cafe it looked really good, staff where abundant and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. So we sit down and I order French toast. After a long wait one of the waiters gives us our silver wear. However (and if your a waiter maybe you can tell me if this happens sometimes) but the waiter walked out of the bathroom (and from what I heard atleast it didn’t sound like she even washed her hands) she then proceeds to hand us the silverware  except she grabbed them the wrong way (basically walked out of the bathroom then handed us the silverware  from the end that you eat off of with her bear hands). Me and my dad immediately noticed this and kinda cringed a bit. When the food finally came out which took a long time like easily 30+ minutes if not even longer after making the order I got French toast which was 2 plain bland pieces of fried bread with a single fried piece of apple on top. There was no seasoning, absolutely nothing on it. I even had to ask for syrup considering there was NONE around in a breakfast place of all things. After finishing the meal we literally had to wait 20+ minutes to get someone’s attention so we could finally pay, even then it took another 10 minutes for them to pick up our card so we could leave. To add insult to injury the place was rather small and very very  hot. There was no AC just one or two fans slowly spinning above us. Now the only good part about the bakery was the pastry chef who I gotta say made very tasty pastries of all kinds. Aside from that the food, and service as a nightmare and I left feeling more cooked than the French toast.

792,whereismyhairbrush31,0,t3_acwhbm,121,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/acwhbm/medical_bill_deceit/,"Last year I had my daughter, and as a teacher I was stressed about finances so I penny pinched as much as I could to make sure all medical bills would be covered. I did the math beforehand and figured we’d pay about $4500 after insurance. 
So if you’ve ever had a baby you know the drs office makes you pay each visit towards the delivery before you’ve even given birth. That was about $3000, which I overpaid on each month so that we’d have a little wiggle room on the last month to buy whatever we needed that we didn’t get from the baby shower. 
This bill included delivery in the hospital his office was apart of, drs. Appts., ultrasounds, etc. 

Little girl decided she was not going to come out and we had to induce, chose our date with the dr and all was good. Until I went into labor 2 days before induction date, and the dr. was not able to be there. So one of the other delivery doctors in town took over and I had had a happy healthy little girl. 

I didn’t even think about how this would change my finances until 2 weeks later when the bills started coming in. $1000 for the new doctors services, $4000 from the hospital, and another $1000 for my daughter’s medical expenses. To sum up, including what I already paid the dr. I was up to $9000 when I expected $4500, something was not right. 

I started making calls and that’s when I found out the doctor’s office never put their bill into my insurance, which meant I never made my deductible and I was paying out of pocket until my daughter’s bill came in and pushed us over our deductible line. When I brought this up I was basically told “oh well, we’re not sending it in until you do your postnatal check in 4 WEEKS, and you better pay the hospital quickly before they send you to collections.

So I called my mom who works in medicine and talked to her about all the bills and what was the best thing for me to do. She said to call the hospital and they would give me the option to either set up installments or pay outright. I should ask how much of a discount I could get if I paid the bill all at once, and also if I get a family discount since she works with the hospital. 

I called the hospital and spoke to billing, they never even gave me the option to pay in full. Just tried to tell me to get a loan and get monthly payments. I asked if I could pay in full, after quite a long pause she said that would be okay and asked for my payment info. I asked if there was a discount offered with that, after another VERY long pause she said yes. I then had to ask her what that discount would be because she would not tell me anything unless I asked each individual question (I can’t even do justice to how shady she sounded as I had to drag these answers out of her). I finally got a 10% discount for paying all at once, but none for the family discount. That was $400 less than what I would have had to pay and I was tired and done with this conversation so I agreed and paid. My mom called later to ask how it went and said it should’ve been at least 20% for paying all at once. 

I also finally just got done fighting with the drs office/insurance and got a check for $3000, 5 MONTHS later. 

All in all it was a very draining experience, medical companies are ridiculous and will try to keep every penny they can.
If any of you are in the US and dealing with medical bills make sure you ask about a lump sum discount and ask every question you can because they expect you not to know any better (like me)!",1,Medical bill deceit,1036

I got five items plus some Christmas discounted items and used digital coupons. (Where you just type in your phone number and BAM!) It took a few seconds longer than normal because the registers take a minute to pull them up and she let out this long, exasperated sigh and asked why I bother with coupons when I just end up taking up everyone's time? 

Well. It's not your business why I coupon! It IS, however, YOUR JOB to be somewhat decent and cash me out. Part of my payment is coupons! What's the big damn deal?

I graduated college in May 2017 and my wonderful grandmother offered to buy me a new car as a gift. Since she and I live in different states, she told me to test drive cars within the given budget, and when she was in town a few weeks later, we would complete the purchase. Simple enough, right?


She also warned me to bring my boyfriend with me to all test drives, because unfortunately- car salesmen can be ruthless with women. So I did. 


I knew I wanted an SUV with good gas milage and the first car I test drove was the Kia Niro. As soon as I arrived at the dealership, I made it clear to the salesman I would NOT be purchasing that day, and explained the above situation. While test driving the car he says ""so.... what is stopping you from purchasing today?!"" Uhh.... I already told you what was! 


After we got back, I asked for a printed quote of what the final cost would be so I could show my grandma, like she explicitly asked for. With this, I got the runaround, was told they ""arent allowed to give printed quotes, but I could take a picture of it"". Getting a printout/picture of this quote took close to two hours of just sitting around. It was obvious they were trying to avoid giving me it. And although I cant say forsure, I believe they overheard me say to my boyfriend that we had an appointment to make at another dealership for a test drive, and we were cutting it close on time, and wanted to keep me as long as possible so I would miss it (which I did, thanks for that). 


FINALLY, when I got the quote, the car was a mere $25 under budget, and that included my trade in for my current vehicle. Online, this vehicle was listed at at least 5k less than what he was offering. BUT! In order for me to get this ""amazing"" deal, I had to close the deal that weekend. This was on a Friday. I repeated the fact that my grandma would not be in town for another two weeks. He then suggested she mail a check to me overnight, and bring it in to the dealership. Yeah, because mailing a check for 25k is totally ideal! 


This was my first car buying process and I did not know what to expect. It left a horrible taste in my mouth, and I ended up having to block the salesmans number because he was texting and calling me nonstop while I was at work!!


The story has a happy ending because I had a MUCH better experience at the next two dealerships I went to. I'm now the proud owner of a beautiful 2018 Honda C-RV and I think I made the right choice. We ended up getting a great deal on the car and the trade in value for my prior car was much more reasonable. ",1,Another car dealership story,690

Sales Rep:  2007 RAV4, one owner,  77,000 miles, kept up on all its maint. (shows carfax with maint. history)

B)  The RAV4:   #1)  3 weeks after purchase -- $438 to replace muffler, exhaust issues (me: stupid tax for not having my mechanic examine it)       #2) 5 months-ish and 5,000 miles-ish   LOST the engine  (2AZFE)  due to excessive oil consumption.  *NO* warning signs of leakage, smoke, etc.       #3)  7 months after replacing engine @$5,000 (with my mechanic who did an oil pressure test on the engine)  the oil light comes on and teen immediately pulls over, shuts down on busy interstate alone at night.  We top off the oil and drive it home with no problems/lights, but the next day (we think the oil pump shut down) driving a couple of miles we lose engine number two.   OUCH!!

C)  Dealer response:   #1)  Gen. Mgr.:  You'll have to prove you ever asked sales rep about the vehicle and any issue it might have.   #2)  GM:  My mechanic checked the oil level, so that engine was fine (FYI  that is not how you diagnose faulty piston rings --- this was the problem ----  Mfr. defect straight from the factory  -----  this brand did not do a recall, but did issue a TSB re: excessive oil consumption  *this info did not show up on the Carfax which the rep showed us)*     \#3  GM:  this vehicle was running exactly as designed by mfr. at the point of sale.

D)  Our two other vehicles have 211k and 177k miles respectively.  I know how to maintain a vehicle.  There was a class action lawsuit, and an enhanced warraty due to this issue, but this crap dealer won't budge in any form of compensation.

TL/DR:    2AZFE is a crap engine with faulty piston rings from the mfr.  Dealer sells $9,000 vehicle like it'll get 200,000 to 300,000 miles with proper maintenance.  Lost the engine at 5,000 miles.  Dealer could care less.

800,KTOSM,0,t3_aciy2n,20,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aciy2n/sure_i_can_continue_leaving_work_early_so_you_can/,"I just needed a place to vent, so feel free to overlook me. Back in April of 2018, the trolley carriage of my garage door opener broke, so I called a well-known garage door repair company to come out and fix it. The service call and part added up to around $100. 
Whatever, I’m sure this won’t happen often and sometimes it’s better to pay someone to do a job correctly then try to do it yourself, right?

Fast forward to the beginning of December: I’m leaving my house at the crack of dawn to go to work, hit the remote to open the door, it opens 90% of the way, then I hear a SNAP and the door comes crashing down so hard I was sure the windows would shatter. The carriage had broken again. I called the company and politely asked if they kept a record of their service calls and if so, were they guaranteed for a certain amount of time, because I knew that it hadn’t been a full year since the part was replaced. She told me the repair was guaranteed for a year, and they would have someone come out to take a look. If the issue was the same that had been fixed before, I would not be charged for the call, only the parts. 

The repairman eventually comes to take a look and confirms that it was the same issue, but he did not have the part he needed. I feel that it is important to note that when he told me he didn’t have the part he needed, he blankly stared at me like he was waiting for me to give him a solution. 
Me: “okay...?”
Him: “.... so I’ll have to order one”
Me: “right.”
Him: “so it might take a while. Sorry”
Me: “that’s fine. I have other ways to get in the house.” 

Fast forward to this Wednesday, they finally come out when my husband is off work to replace the trolley carriage. They also mention that the springs are old and might cause strain on the motor, so my husband pays them an additional $30 to replace the springs. 

This morning. Friday morning. TWO DAYS after the repair. I am in my car and smash the button to close the door as I leave. The door begins to close, then gets caught on some invisible obstruction and opens right back up. I get out and look at every conceivable thing that could cause the door to be stuck, eventually give up, close it manually and leave. 

I call the company and say, “you guys were out here two days ago to repair something that had been repaired in April and had broken again, and now the door won’t shut.”
She puts me on hold for about six minutes, then tells me she can’t find my account.  She then calls me a while later and tells me she found my account, and that they could have someone out this afternoon, when would I be home? 4 pm is inconvenient for them (bless their hearts), so I agree to leave work even earlier to meet them at 3:00. She IMMEDIATELY calls me back and tells me that there aren’t actually going to be any technicians in my area this afternoon, could I wait until Monday? I said “well I guess so, my husband will be home before 11:30.” This does not work for them, can’t we be home that afternoon?

This is when I got mad. I informed her that this would be the fourth time they would be at my home to repair the same issue, I should not go out of my way to accommodate their schedule. She then tries to tell me that I am mistaken. 
Her: “No ma’am, the last time we were there was to replace the spring, not the carriage.”
Me: “No no, the spring was changed at the same time as the carriage because he told my husband they were old and needed replaced.”
Her: “well we have technicians spread apart in Buttsville and Asstown today, I just don’t think we can get anyone to you this afternoon.”
Me: “If you can’t have someone out this afternoon, I will call someone else, you’ve wasted enough of my time. Thanks.”

It’s not just the fact that the system keeps breaking after I waste time and money having them fix it, it’s that they want ME to accommodate THEM, while also trying to lie to me and tell me that they weren’t actually fixing something they had failed to do correctly before. Thankfully I got a recommendation for someone else from a coworker and he will be out next week. I know “next week” is later than this afternoon or Monday, but I will go to hell and die before the original company gets any more of my money. 

And now I get to feel guilty all day for being short with a customer service worker. 
 
EDIT: I wanted to give an update on this. I had a different company come out to look at the door today, and it was all kinds of messed up. The previous company had not installed safety cables for the new springs, nothing was lubricated, and the resistance/door flinging back open was caused by the door scraping against the house as it tried to close. The new guy spent over two hours on the needed repairs, and made sure the door could actually open and close more than once without breaking before he left. I’m glad I didn’t give the previous company an opportunity to “fix” their mistake. ",1,"Sure, I can continue leaving work early so you can fix your previous “repairs”",312

So, I had two coupons for a certain brand of shampoo and I excitedly found a store having them on sale. I grabbed two bottles of shampoo and a drink and set my things on the counter. The cashier was friendly at first while ringing me up but when I handed her the coupons, she frowned. She read the coupon, glanced at the bottle, stared at her screen, and clicked her teeth. She took my items off the counter and set them behind the counter and said she would not sell me anything. Confused, I asked why. She said that the shampoo was on sale and that with the coupon I would save too much money. I just stared at her and she then told me that the store wouldn't allow her to sell the shampoo that cheap. Cue more staring. I did ask if I could just buy my drink and she told me that I could not and that I would have to leave the store. 

I understand couponing can be hassle and most employees are not trained how to accept coupons but seriously. I just moved along to the next location and made my purchase no problem. Still makes me laugh to remember her deadpan face when she asked me to leave. ",1,She made me leave the store....,1459
802,WVPrepper,0,t3_acoftp,2,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/acoftp/i_am_trying_to_help_you/,"So, after Christmas I placed an order online. It was for 9 similar items. Doesn't matter what, could be books, or candy bars or T-shirts. Doesn't change the story.

I had purchased from this seller before, and knew it would be a week or so before I got the parcel.

I got an email with a tracking number the following morning, followed a few hours later by another email, with a different tracking number. I realized that my order had been split into 2 boxes. Neither had shipped out yet.

Later, as I was transferring the tracking numbers into Packagetrackr, I noticed that one package was addressed to me, at my address (the same address I have used on prior orders) and the other was going to an address in the next county that I had not provided.

I emailed customer service immediately and was initially told I was wrong, and that the items would all reach me, with no interference from anyone. 

I replied with screenshots showing the town name to which the second parcel was headed.

I soon got another email, saying it was a database glitch, but that ALL my items would go out on New Years Eve, in a single box, to me, at my address, which was typed out.

Cool.

On Wednesday morning I logged into Packagetrackr, and one parcel still showed ""shipping information received"" and indicated that the parcel had not yet transferred to the carrier. The second parcel had been picked up, and had moved to a major hub. 

Clicking through to check the anticipated delivery date, I saw that the package weight seemed to be the full order, and that it was now ALL headed to the WRONG address!

I emailed customer support in a panic. I apologized for coming off like a crazy person, as I knew they were quite sure I was overreacting, and that they had already fixed whatever shipment I was writing about., but that, respectfully, I felt there might still be a problem.

On the one hand, I knew that I had covered myself and they would have to replace the order. There was very little question that this was their mistake, and that I had ALREADY made an effort to help save them this expense, but they went on to compound the error. 

On the other hand, if I had done NOTHING, at least HALF of my order would be arriving tomorrow (Saturday). And with that in mind, I felt somewhat responsible for this mixup (logically, I can't be blamed, but I have guilt issues). 

So when they did not reply on Wednesday, I called on Thursday. 

By this point, the package was within 50 miles of me, so I called the vendor. I got voicemail, so I tried explaining briefly, including the order number, my address, the tracking numbers, and prior attempt to correct it days earlier.

I tried logging in to my account with the shipping company, and attempted to redirect the parcel. But, since it was not destined for my registered address, I was unable to change it.

Today, the parcel was in the depot nearest the wrong ZIP code. I was annoyed, but hoped the shipper would still be able to redirect it, so I would get it tomorrow.

I got an email, ""apologizing"" for the error, and for the delay in replying. But... Instead of redirecting my package, they had arranged to have it RETURNED TO THEM! I wrote back immediately asking why. They haven't replied. 

At the least, I'd have thought they'd have sent a replacement package out today, and at the most, maybe included an extra item, or discount code for a future order, and absorbed the cost of a faster shipping method. Even so, it would be several days later than expected.

I am just annoyed at how this was handled. I can't think of anything I did to cause this, or anything more I could have done to correct it.

 ETA - I just remembered. When I originally placed the order, it was because they had emailed me a code for 20% off. When I was ready to check out, however, and attempted to apply the code, I was informed that a discount code had already been applied to my order, and another code could not be added. 

The code that had been applied automatically was 8% off, and there was no way to remove that code so I could apply the other.

**Backstory:** Last year my  friend tells me he and his girlfriend are getting married, hooray! As they're both from \[foreign country\] they will host it there and I say I'm happy to come, so I go on and book a flight ticket.

Now, I'm one of those people with several names A B C D (as is customary where I'm from) although in everyday life I just go by C D. I accidentally book the ticket under just the name C D. The company, as is usual, is adamant about ticket name matching the name on the passport exactly.

**Story A, changing a ticket:** A few weeks before the trip, as I'm making sure everything is in order, I realize my mistake. The ticket is in the ""wrong"" name. Crap. Totally my fault and I was already coming to terms with having to buy a new ticket. Before I do that, let me just ask them if anything can be done. 

Oh man, here we go.

I message the company's FB page, explain the situation, and ask them if this is going to be a problem. They give me a number to call.

I call the number, they tell me I should write this up on an online form and give me the URL.

I fill out the online form, and it gives me a new number to call.

I call the number, they tell me I should write this up on an online form. I tell them that's what I did. They redirect me to another number.

I explain my predicament yet again, they say OK, and transfer me to yet another number.

I explain my predicament yet again, they finally acknowledge my online form, but tell me it's been done incorrectly. I should have included a photo of my passport. No one told me this. Oh well, I do it all over again.

And then I do it all once again because they required a specific file format. Please note that their customer service number(s) are not local and it's costing me about 0,60 EUR per minute, and there's always a queue.

Finally the guy on the phone says thanks and that they'll get back to me.

Almost two weeks go by. They finally e-mail me saying they can't change the name of a ticket, but if I book a new one they will refund the old one. At this point the wedding is only a week away. Sure. I call them up and make the arrangements.

I attend the wedding, everything is good, they say I do, etc. 

**Story B, getting a refund:** So they could not simply return the money electronically, I have to show up at their sales office with my physical credit card. For money laundering protection perhaps?

Anyway, I go there as I'm flying home, and after a long process they tell me it's the wrong card. It's not my other one either. After some research I discover I didn't pay by card at all, but by a direct bank transfer. As my paperwork says I should show them my card they say they can't do anything and I have to call customer service again. Sigh.

I get home and call them up asking what to do. After several weeks of ""research"" (the customer service ticket did say this) they contact me saying I can go to their sales office at my local airport and suddenly no card is needed, they'll give me the money in cash. The airport is a bit of a ride, but sure. A few days later, I tell my boss I'll be late for work, and I go there and the guy at the sales office is really confused. They never have any cash on hand there?!

He is helpful though and shows me yet another form for refunds where I can enter my bank details and they'll transfer the money there.

I fill everything out and submit the paperwork the next day. Two weeks later I get a reply saying the money will be refunded within four weeks. About 3-4 weeks later, there's suddenly money in my account! 

This is almost four months after my first customer service message and I've easily spent at least 8 hours on the phone, going to/visiting sales offices, filling out paper work, etc. But I won.

\---

**To be clear:** I  never suspected malicious intent on their part, this is a big and serious company and I definitely blame outdated info, lack of routines, bad communication etc. more than the people I interacted with. Or maybe the plan is to make the process horrible to make me give up and not take my money. Either way I'll think twice before flying with them again.

\---

**TL;DR** I book a flight ticket in the wrong name, customer service allows a refund but the process requires an outrageous amount of phone calls and in-person meetings over many months. I persist and finally get the money.

I had to call in sick at work that morning so that I could visit a hospital and sort myself out. I was feeling feverish and generally weak, so I almost had to drag myself to the hospital. 

  
Unfortunately for me, the hospital was built on a massive expanse of land, with various units far flung from each other. By the time I made to the reception from the gate, I was already tired. I joined the medium-sized queue and waited my turn. 

  
Eventually, it got to my turn, and I presented my hospital card to the nurse. She glanced at the card and told me in a flat voice that I had to get the new hospital card as mine was being phased out. 

  
She gave me a couple of forms to fill and beckoned on the next patient to come forward. I stepped aside and began filling the forms on the counter beside the desk. 

  
Finally! I finished filling the forms and walked forward to submit and get a new ID. The nurse took the forms and then asked me for a photocopy of my ID Card (?!).

  
At this point getting a little impatient (no one told me anything about making a photocopy). I spotted a photocopier behind the nurse, and I felt relieved. I retrieved my ID Card from my wallet. 

  
As I handed it over to her, she reminds me again that she needs a photocopy of the ID and not the original. At this point, I pleaded with her to help me make a copy with the copier behind her. 

  
She responds with a flat ""No, you have to go outside to make a photocopy""

  
That is not the heartbreaking part. I pleaded again and she insisted the copy machine was for internal use only. I gave up and then ask her what section of the hospital I could find copier in. 

  
And she says to ""You have to go outside the gate, walk a little down the road, you'd see a business centre. There you can make your photocopy"" 

  
I could not believe my ears! This nurse just asked a sick patient to walk a distance of about 0.5km under the sun to make a photocopy? 

  
I realized the nurse didn't care or feel concerned about any of the patients and it was a sad realization. 

  
Not having any other option, I made the long walk to the hospital gate. There I flagged down a cab and found my way to another hospital. Where I got the care I needed.

Again, small bank. No ATM or anything; they’re now starting out. To set the stage, there’s a national organization in my country , and my dad is the head of the regional division where I live.

Rinse and repeat the last two bits of dialogue a few more times. I was honestly baffled. I didn’t know any one human could be that stupid. Until finally she finally understood that it wasn’t necessary to scrap the account completely. 

TL: you can just tell your dad that he should write a letter to us stating his intent to transfer the account to your name etc etc 

I get all the necessary info I’ll need, then get up to leave. When I’m leaving, this woman has the nerve to ask me(and I quote), ‘So what are you going to use the money for?’ I was so shocked at the lack of professionalism that finally climaxed in this stupid question that I just said ‘I’m going to buy something,’ and left. Also because she kinda works with my dad and in my part of the world a lot of emphasis is placed on sHoWiNg ReSpEcT tO oNe’S eLdErS, and I have to keep up appearances as the big boss’ lovely daughter 🙄. 






Scenario 2: a shorter story, happened in a relatively large department store near my home. I went to pick up a delivery and stopped by there to get some stuff for my sister. The package was kinda small and I didn’t have a bag or anything, so I took it to the place where you leave parcels and stuff and they give you a number so you come for your shit after. The guy told me it was kinda small, and since it was pre sealed I could take it in and just have the security man put a sticker on it

I got to security and this man, instead of stickering my package, wanted to know what was in it. I refused to tell him and asked him to just sticker it. He kept bugging me, even going as far as to say, ‘I want to know. What if there’s a problem and you get arrested and the police are coming to open it, will you also tell them you won’t open it?’ This man also wasted a good chunk of my time until I said I would simply take it back to the Parcels kiosk and leave it there if he wouldn’t sticker it. That’s when he finally gave me the sticker and I went my merry way.

Had inspections etc, nothing is crazy out of whack so I’m good with it. Mortgage approved on my end, just ironing out final deets. Part of the contract stated seller was to provide city certification (about $800 in repairs to get the cert) turns out seller is broke (which I knew going in, this house is a foreclosure in the redemption period). Asked to see seller statement since I was going to negotiate paying for the repairs myself in exchange for $ back on the purchase price. Turns out that the seller will be in the hole 5k if he sells at the agreed upon price. How did his agent not know this? Even at the asking price he would have been in the hole 3k. Pretty sure they are going to back out since there’s no incentive to sell. I’m super mad since I’ve already paid for inspections and appraisals etc. And I’ve missed out on other houses that came along after I offered on this one.

The next week we went into pizza place and said “hey we have some vouchers on our account and we wanted to know what they were” and was told by the manager that there were no vouchers, also no proof that we did this good deed even though we gave them the car and employee details, and was called a liar and to show them proof next time.

I was interested in getting a few new pairs of shoes that I can comfortably wear at work. I got to the store at 8am and waited in line for an hour for the doors to open. At 9am, I get to the shoe section, I began looking around and immediately fell in love with the most beautiful shoes. I get them in my correct size (they only had a few shoes in each size as they were clearing out their inventory). 

I get in line to purchase my shoes and it had a tag that was old and did not accurately represent the sale price. The employee rang me up using the shoe box tag that my friend had (she was buying the same pair of shoes as I was). With the sales going on storewide, the machines became overloaded and the register went offline. I had tried my debit card three times, went through the process of putting in my pin and the purchase kept failing because of an offline register. After switching to a new register, the employee realized that she needed to get the correct sales tag printed so that the shoes will ring up as the sale price. The employee ringing me up puts all my shoe boxes on the back counter and runs to get the correct tag printed. In the time between when she set the shoes down and came back to put the new tag on the box, another employee had mistaken the shoes that I was actively purchasing for returns and restocked them. The employee helping me (a very nice, but frazzled woman) came back and found that the shoes were gone. She searched for them with the help of another associate but they were unable to find the shoes I was purchasing. 

After 25 minutes of waiting by the register while other people were rang up, one of the service managers came over and told me “We gave your shoes to someone else, we don’t have anymore in the size you had before”. I was pretty upset at this point as they were a wonderful price and very comfortable. I asked her what had happened because I had been actively purchasing the shoes and now an employee gave the only pair to another customer. I expressed that I was frustrated and saddened and asked if there was a way we could solve the situation and double check to see if the employees had missed something in the back room as the shoes had to be somewhere. She left briefly and brought me a pair that was two sizes bigger than what I could wear and she told me “I can’t do anything for you, you’re going to have to make these work. I don’t know what you want me to do I can’t take them back from the other customer so nothing can be done”. I told her that the shoes were too big and I could not comfortably wear them and I was then given a pair of shoes that were similar and told that they had found the shoes. When they went to ring me up, my total was 3 times what it should have been and I realized that they had given me shoes that were similar but at regular price for $120 and expected me to just purchase them and move on to avoid escalating the situation. When I questioned this, the sales manager rolled her eyes and told me that I was holding up the registers and a line was forming, even though the employees restocking shoes were the ones who took my purchase and gave them to someone else. 

I could hear the sales manager in the back snapping and the employee who left the shoes on the counter (even though it was her first day in the shoe department and not her fault Someone picked them up). I was about to just say screw it and leave but another sales manager came in, pulled the first manager aside and then came out and gave me the regular priced shoes for the sales price as a replacement for the shoes I had purchased that got sold to another customer.

I bought some somewhat Expensive Headphones from a European brand, great product but, boy was the Customer Support experience a nightmare.  


A bit of Context:  


I bought the Headphones in June, sometime around August my email Account got hacked and subsequently deleted by the provider. Hence I had no order number no nothing. (This is important later)

At the end of October the headphones started to sound weird, even after changing cables. So I thought: ""No Problem, I got a lifetime warranty, this gonna be over quick.""  


Or so I thought....  


First I had to scour the depths of their Website to even find the contact info, as I live in a different country the numbers posted on their website did not work. Only after calling the number of the outlet store they have (which thank god - was reachable from my country) I got a number that worked.

To their credit they were very accommodating considering that I had no Invoice and no nothing  except my Paypal bill to prove I bought them. So as by their policy they arrange a pick-up of the defect hardware, and once it's back with them either repair or replace it (depends on the cheaper option for them) - great, seems handy. So they arranged Pick-up I get a notification E-Mail by the delivery company, and lo and behold, they give me a very narrow time frame of 08:00AM to 18:00PM for pick-up. Of course it was Monday, and they only do pick-up on business days.

  
Guess who was at work when the delivery guy came to pick my stuff up -&gt; yes, me like every normal working person would...  
The postal-service of course does have a support hotline - guess which support hotline never had a human individual operating it...  


So after 3 failed Pick-ups, trying to get into contact with the delivery service by mail and failing, I turned to the headphone-company to try and change it. Thankfully the front-desk ladies at the place where I work at are so nice to handle the pick-up for me.  


We are now reaching the end of November, the return is on the way...should be a breeze until I get them back/new ones...  


Or not...cause I haven't heard anything for 2 weeks at this point, my written support Tickets don't get answered. I then get a rather stern E-mail back, telling me ""They have not forgotten about me, they will send new Headphones right away so this is over. Also I shall only respond to this Email for further questions, as using the official support Address will create   a new ticket in their system every time""

  
Sure - no problem, so I wait another week. No headphones, no responses (I replied to the Mail, but every time I did it created a new ticket regardless) no nothing...but...I got my old Package back.

At least what was left of it. As I only got the outer box back, and the headphones were gone. Delivery Service slapped a ""couldn't deliver"" sticker on it, and just returned it 3 Weeks later.

&amp;#x200B;

So I called the headphone company (as there are no humans available at the package service), telling them about everything, giving them about 5 numbers of support tickets. They seemed really nice and told me to send them picture of the stuff that returned and the slips and what not - cool thing, no problem. I am already pretty agitated, and the lack of beats since November bring me to the brink of withdrawal, but hey! At least they try!  


So no Problem I send them all the stuff...Christmas is rolling around and for a company focusing on audio equipment the support delivers a deafening silence.  
So again I try to reach the support via phone, you can Imagine how chill and not-at-all stressed the support hotline was during Christmas.

The support guy only barked at me that without the invoice/order-number he can't do shit.  
So I explained that I don't have that, it was never a problem until now and what I can do to get this issue resolved.  
So he told me: Submit a ticket to request my order-number from back then, but it might take a while cause of Christmas they got lots of stuff to do, so the ticket will be queued behind everyone else.  
After stating that I have been waiting for more than a month at this point, with constantly getting the silent treatment, that I want an answer ASAP on how to deal with this further or at least they should tell me what's going on now.  
Begrudgingly he told me to call back once I got a ticket number, then they could put it on high-prio.  


Said and done - the next support guy was much friendlier and actually gave me a copy of my order from way-back-when, cause their system connects the support tickets with the order-number and customer number. Hence, every time I sent them a new E-Mail the recipient employee had to start from scratch with my case....

I talked with 4 different people, and nobody told me that lil' tidbit that would have made this easier.

He then tells me he will send me a form for me to sign that states legally that I send the box correctly and what not, once I return it signed they just gonna send me a replacement and deal with the package service them self  


I could almost feel the sweet warmth of my soon-to-be-here Headphones on my ears, caressing me with tasty bass and shielding me from the harsh cold of the wintery commute....but alas...I got my order and invoice...but the legal form never arrived. And I was there again: In silence.  


Of course I didn't expect to reach anyone during Christmas and NYE....so I sat in silence until today I could call my now close friends of the support, finally getting the legal form, and finally the assurance that my headphones will be with me soon. Hopefully.

I went through 7 different support ticket numbers, talked with 8 different support guys and 1 robot. Thanks for letting me vent.

To give some details I went to the burger shop because I wanted some trash food to feel better.  My wife (Lisa) is terminally ill with a rare illness and the hard decision was mid-last year to transfer her to a nursing home due to having zero help from her toxic family, her health getting worse, dementia progressing (from the past couple years) and the fact that I am disabled and couldn't keep up the routine as caregiver for over a decade has broken me. On to the story..

So I had just had a big verbal argument over the phone with Lisa about why I'm upset today, the past six years she has been emotionally neglectful and it has strained our relationship in futile hope that maybe today won't be the same as any other and tommrow if not later she would completely forget it all. I parked right in front of the restaurant this couple in a red sports car park beside me and since I knew with the stress of that day I would need my cane (stress makes my symptoms worse) that I let them both get out first. So once inside I wait behind them and seemed very friendly with the staff.

I also hear what they are saying in another language, the guy says ""fat boy should eat more salads."" and she responding ""cookies and cakes must be why he uses the cane"" and I just glare at them but I didn't say anything because the fight before mentally exhausted me and I was worried with how nasty they were talking about that if it got heated things getting nasty.

So I let it go and let the horrible couple make their comments and just figure out what I want. Now I have been to this place a number of times around this shift as it's one of the few places open and I've learned who's the managers and so I see the manager come over and talk with the couple. They mock me to him and make some more insults and he had the gall to respond to them in the same language.

He also used several racial slurs and this infuriated me as this guy has been a prick in the past not just to me but other customers.

Son tried to transfer full bill and service into his name, even though law stated that bills were supposed to be wiped when account holders died. Company declined, because he accidently used service past her death (he forgot gas was even a bill), so he lets service lapse. Refused to reactivate service for over two years, until I come along and need hot water. After fighting further with the company and explaining the law to them, they finally activate service, requiring that son be on the account as well. Son finally gets first hot shower in about 2.5 years, sighs happily afterwards. Also, this is reposted from Malicious Compliance sub, due to it being determined to not qualify.


This is my boyfriend's story, but I'm telling it because I helped resolve it. Since the story ended up being longer than expected, I've included a TLDR at the bottom.


Three years ago, my boyfriend's mother died of cancer. He, naturally, didn't think of some of the bills that were in her name. He didn't even realize that there was a gas bill until a couple months later. He called all of the companies that she had a bill with, and managed to either transfer the bills into his name (paying for the back owed balance), or cancel the service and reactivate it in his name. Except for the gas company... Keep in mind, in our state, companies cannot come after the remaining family members for bills in the deceased person's name. So my boyfriend did NOT have to pay the backowed balance of any bill in her name. He just did it because it was the ""right"" thing to do.


But when he contacted the gas company, someone gave him grief. They told him that they couldn't do anything without proof of her death. When he agreed to provide that to them, they told him that it wasn't enough, and that he owed the full balance before they could transfer the service into his name. They said that because the service had been used for a couple months after her death (remember, he didn't even remember that gas was active, while initialy grieving over her death), that SOMEONE was responsible for the full balance.


He tried speaking to someone else a few days later. Again, the new rep decided that he was trying to steal from them, and refused to give him the option of transfering the service into his name. He was going to have to pay the full balance, regardless of the existing law that basically stated that the company should have completely wiped the debt, since the account holder was DEAD. And he had provided conclusive evidence of that. He had provided them with a certified copy of the death certificate, and she was the only account holder on the account.


So, because they refused to transfer the service, he decided to not pay the bill at all. He continued to pay the other accounts off, at times just subsisting off ramen to make sure the bills were sorta paid (late fees notwistanding), and his dogs were fed. He did this for over two years. Keep in mind, this meant NO hot water, and he couldn't use the gas heater or the gas dryer.


Instead, he existed off cold water showers, and hung his clothes to dry out in the backyard. He maintained a small electric heater for the bedroom only, and basically just did whatever was necessary to survive without any house gas.


Then I came along. I stayed with him for a year, before putting my foot down. I decided that I was going to pay for the gas, and get it turned on in my name. He gave in, because he didn't want me to have to deal with the cold water. I had/have medical issues which made not having gas made things much more difficult for me.


However, when I applied, the gas company wanted information about my lease. I provided a bogus roommate agreement, because I was actually living rent free with my bf. However, we were honest about who was living in the house. And that meant that his name was on the roommate agreement. When they saw that, they refused to proceed without speaking to him.


So I got him to talk, on speaker phone, with them. Since it was speaker phone, I also talked. And boy, did I talk. I explained to them the law. And gave them statutes. And sent them a picture of the death certificate. And refused to allow them to finagle their way out of anything. They finally agreed to let me start service with them. However, they required, for some strange reason, that he also be on the account. Fine. I was willing to do that. AND they completely cancelled the original debt, I made damn sure of that.


It took a few days, but we finally got the gas turned on. And because I set up the account to automatically pay monthly, there were no fees, other than the initial small set up fee. No deposit, no required extra fees, no nothing. I did set up the account to take out what they figured would be the yearly cost, divided into monthly snippets. But we had gas, finally. He took his first heavenly hot shower in over 2.5 years, and ended up a limp noodle afterwards. Fortunately, we haven't heard a peep from the gas company since.


However, if I hadn't come along, he would still be taking cold water showers to this day. He was determined that he wasn't going to deal with them, with the way he was treated previously. And yes, their customer service was still crappy when I dealt with them, but they acknowledged that I knew too much to allow their bs to continue.",1,Can't get gas turned on because of outstanding bill from dead parent?

We drive to the destination, it takes a long time and a couple of ferries too get there, so it’s later in the evening. We arrive and the owner greets us my hubby introduces me as his wife. Owner mentions he saw we were from a nearby large town (about 4 hours away).

We go inside to check in and hubby mentions that we would like a restaurant recommendation and the owner looks at me:

Owner: wait, are *you* staying here too?

Me: ...yes...

Owner: oh, well I thought you were just dropping him off! (He starts scribbling on his pad)

We thought this was odd. So we are checked in and heading over to the mil on the property and I ask about the hot tub.

Owner: it’s not turned on, keeping it hot all the time costs a lot. 

I didn’t say anything but I was like, you knew we were coming and advertised it.

Owner then tells us it’s ok because we have the jacuzzi tub and that will be nice for a soak.
Ok, fine. He also tells us if we want to watch the opening Olympic ceremonies later we were welcome in the house. We get settled and look through the stuff in the suite before deciding to go out for dinner. Noting that the owner hadn’t told us what time breakfast was we decide to stop at the main house and knock. He answers and it is clear he didn’t want to answer the door and we were not welcome in.

Hubby: hey! We were wondering what time breakfast is being served?

Owner: (laughs), there’s no breakfast! Certainly not at *these* prices! 

We go have dinner and after I’m thinking I’ll use the giant jacuzzi tub. I run the water, it’s all nice and hot water is running in and I get in and the tub is almost half full and runs out of hot water. 

I’m very disappointed, and kind of cold. The next morning we get up, have some coffee and head out for the day. We return, no one has been to service our room. Ok, no biggie, but still. We were there four days and no one serviced our room during the time. All I really wanted was someone to come make the bed and vacuum. That wouldn’t be so bad on its own. 

We didn’t see the owner during our stay (no, he did not check on us), until it’s time to check out. I let hubby deal with that. We had a good time anyhow but I was pissed about the accommodations.

TLDR: go to b&amp;b and am asked if I’m staying with my husband; told there will be no hot tub, no advertised breakfast. Are laughed at for thinking we would have breakfast, and then ignored during our stay.",1,A B&amp;B tale.,59

The German parcel service operates ""shipping stations"", i.e. automated PO boxes for sending and receiving parcels. I have a return label from an online retailer because I need a refund, and I'm unsure if those labels work with the shipping station computer, so I decide to enter a brick-and-mortar office of theirs to post the parcel 'manually.' The following happens after the transaction is already done.

**Me:** Excuse me, I was wondering if I can post a return parcel at a shipping station?

**Employee:** ... shipping station?

**Me:** Yes?

**Employee:** ... for returns?

**Me:** Yes..?

**Employee:** Think about that for a second. It's obvious, isn't it?

**Me:** Sorry if that's a dumb question, but if it were obvious, I wouldn't be asking.

**Employee:** Shipping stations are for receiving parcels, not for posting them. So, no. Of course not.

**Me:** Oh. Okay. Thanks.

When I got home, I did some research online. By now, I needed to know if my several dozen experiences of posting parcels at shipping stations (none of them returns with a printed label, hence the question) had all been very vivid dreams, so I did some research. Not only do shipping stations allow posting parcels - a ten-second Google search shows that - but they do allow returns.

The people there are usually SUPER chill, and I love to stop by, get my large Dr Pepper (they have the 99¢ any size drink) and a little snack, and talk with the cashiers for a bit. On this particular night, none of the people I knew were there, so I went to get my drink. The first two cups I grabbed were ripped, so I threw them out. Sometimes the machine doesn't have the right mix, so I poured some out, took a sip or 2, and then filled it up all the way and brought it to the register. Guy glares at me, and mumbles something about ""paying for the one I dropped."" I gave him an odd look, and once he repeated himself, I realized he was talking about the cups I threw in the trash, so I explained why. Wrong. ""No, what I SAID was, are you going to PAY for the one you DRANK?!"" After figuring out what he meant, I explained what happened AGAIN, but he insisted I pay. I said I only took 2 sips, which is perfectly reasonable, to which he replied over and over again that he (exact words here) ""watched my guzzle the whole thing down."" Now I don't know who can drink 44 ounces of Dr Pepper in 3 seconds, but I sure as hell can't. After arguing with him a while, I just said ""forget it man, it's 99 cents.

I found a hair that was obviously a pubic hair based on how the part that pulled out of the follicle looked.

The waitress wasn't nearby when it happened, so I mentioned it to the host, who was very nice and agreed with me that it was gross and said he'd get the manager.

Then the manager came out, and she implied that I was racist by claiming it must have been a hair from someone's head, and said ""you know, ***some people*** have coarser hair than others.""

Then she went into the kitchen, came back, and smugly informed me that everyone in the kitchen had shaved heads, so she ""didn't know where it came from"" (thus confirming that the hair was a pubic hair).

She offered to have my food remade for free, but I was so disgusted that I couldn't eat there, so I left. That restaurant went out of business and closed within a year of that incident, for obvious reasons.

834,girl_that_lurks,0,t3_abeqqz,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/abeqqz/if_a_customer_nicely_points_out_an_error_please/,"Sorry this is too long. But a bit of background is needed:

I started working 2 years ago as a a tester (this is relevant, I promise). By law you get health insurance and retirement funds (basically, a percentage of your salary goes to those). So I start making ""voluntary contributions"" to my retirement fund for 2 reasons:

1) I don't wanna be 70 years old and not having a penny to live.

2) Every voluntary contribution can be deducted from taxes up to 15% of you annual income. 

Let's say you had to pay $1000 on taxes for the year. Your employer deducted a part from your salary and you deducted a few things here and there so you overpaid $50. The goverment will reimburse you those 50 bucks. So the more contributions you make increases the chances of the goverment reimbursing you a few bucks and you save up for when you're old. It's a win-win for me.

Now, if you don't pick a company to manage your retirement funds, the goverment will assign you one at random and you can change it every year. As a first employee fresh out of college, I didn't pick a company and was assigned one that didn't have the best reviews, so I changed it on June for one that would get me better return of investment. Legally they have up to 3 months to turn my papers over and sure enough, they used up those 3 months. 

So mid-October I'm with the new company and first things first, I check my profile on their site and find an option called ""Verify your information"" wich helps you complete your data so everything is cool. I try to use it but every time I click on the ""Start"" button the page simply reloads. I go to the console and start looking for errors but nothing. So I email letting them know of the issue. They answer telling me to call them so the can ""fulfill my request"". 

Now, this annoys me as the email was a copy-paste from a manual and there is no request, I'm just being nice letting you know your page doesn't work. Also, you have to go throgh like 6 menus before you can talk to a human who will ask you about 10 questions to verify your identity. I'm not gonna spend 20 minutes of my life doing that just to tell you that your developer screwed up. So I tell them that on email. Again, their response is to call them. So I let it go since I programmed a voluntary contribution every month and the first one just passed without trouble. 

The end of the year comes, I get my bonus and sure enough, I want to put it on my retirement fund because taxes. I try to do it from their page and get a ""Service not available. Try later"" message. Fine, I try next day and same message. By the third day I'm guessing something is wrong and since I'm using Direfox I try to do it from Bhrome. Same message. Try from their app? Same message. So I program the contribution, seeing as the monthly one went by fine.

3 days later the money is still on my bank account so I call the company to find out what's going on. After 20 minutes of questions, the guy on the phone tells me that my bank rejected the transaction and I should speak with them as sometimes they would think it's an internet purchase and block them. Fine, I'll talk to them even though I buy 99% of my stuff from Emazon. I go to the bank and nothing's wrong, so I program another contribution.

3 days later, same thing: money is still on my account. It's December 28 and I need this transaction now if I want to deduct it so I call them. The lady on the phone tells me the problem is because I'm using an account from a BankB while the monthly contributions come from BankA. I tell them I have no account with BankA and every month the money is taken up from BankB. Confused and, I think, a little bit over hear head, she transfers me to another department. And that's when I loose it.

The new lady tells me they have no problem with their page and they can do a contribution right then, and start this (not) funny conversation: (I'll be ME, she'll be CS for costumer support) 

CS: Miss, the problem could be that you don't have enough signal. Could you please move to a place with better reception? 

ME: I'm wired, reception is not an issue. 

CS: Ok, are you doing this from a computer or our app? 

ME: Laptop with Bhrome and Direfox and your app. The 3 show the same message. 

CS: I see. You need to do it from Bhrome. 

ME: I did. Same message. 

CS: OK, you probably need to move to get better reception since I'm not having trouble. 

ME: I already told you, my laptop is connected through ethernet. There's no way to ""get better reception"". 

CS: OK, let's try this. Open Bhrome, go to (...insert instructions here...) 

ME: Same message. Service not available. Please try later. 

This went on about 20 minutes before I ask her to actually listen. Finally she told me to send them a screenshot of the message and they'd have an answer on Friday. Except I need this contribution before the year ends to be able to deduct it. So I tell her that, in a harsh voice by this point. She tells me that, if I gave her verbal permission, she would access my account and make the contribution for me, since she doesn't have problems. Great! I gave her my username and password and she went silent for about 15 minutes. When she came back she told me she was having the same issue as me. What a surprise!!!! 

She asks me to send the screenshot and I tell her, looking at the console from Bhrome, what the error is. That sets her on the right way and about 10 minutes later she tells me the problems is my account doesn't have X info. I have to download a second app and take a photo of my ID to fill that info. The moment I do it the problem is solved and when I informed her this, she tells me that either way my contribution won't be deductible for the year because I did it after 2PM of the last day. 

What the actual F*CK?!?! I just spent 2 hours on the phone with you and you tell me this now?!?! Not to mention I've been trying this for 1 month... 

So I wrote a lengthy email, describing every single interaction and problem I've had with them for the past 3 months, including images of the calls and emails. Also included hourly rates for freelance testers and screenshots and videos of every little error and warning their site is throwing. Even grammar mistakes. By the end, I wrote in caps that the whole issue could've been resolved if they had fixed the ""Verify your info"" option 3 months prior. I sent it to development AND costumer support addresses. 

Then I took my bonus and bought a FS4 VR Bundle and invested the rest :) ",1,"If a customer nicely points out an error, please take care of it",32

My boyfriend lived in Texas and I lived in California the time. Therefore, I had gotten a new phone that had a Texas phone number. I wanted my original California phone number on my new device. First, I had my line deactivated from my previous provider and called B&amp;S to change my Texas #.

The guy, even though he was confused, managed to get my previous number onto my new device. My texan phone was officially a californian phone! Yay! All was well until we saw our phone bill which was $200 more than what we expected. Turns out the guy fucked up and SOMEHOW added an extra line to our plan rather than simply switching the phone numbers.

Our (accidental) plan:
1. My boyfriends phone
2. My New phone
3.  My New phone with the texan phone number (that did not even exist)

We were pretty much getting charged for a line that DIDN’T EXIST. Pretty much getting charged DOUBLE for my phone. We had to pay $500 + in order to keep our phones activated and immediately called to try to get our money back. They kept saying there was nothing they could do about it except delete my Californian number and give me the texan number, which was unacceptable for me. This went on for several weeks.

One conversation in particular PISSED me off

My boyfriend was having problems with this particular lady because she wasn’t understanding the situation. So, I was added to the call to help out.

Lady: Ok, so we cannot give your money back or even credit you back unless you get rid of the californian number 

Me: So... we have to pay for someone else’s mistake? We have to lose 500+ just because someone messed up!?

Lady: ... Sorry

Me: This is ridiculous. Goodbye. 

Lady: Have a merry chris-

Me: *HANGS UP*

Pretty much B&amp;S was telling us that there was NOTHING they can do and that whatever we paid could not be credited or refunded back to us. I know I was being stubborn as hell with my californian number, but I knew WELL that I would be able to keep it and get my money back. Well, turns out I was right! a worker *MAGICALLY* found a way to get our money back to us. With his help, we opened an urgent case and had to go to corporate level to have our plan fixed and our $ credited back to us. 

EVERYONE after this was very good at what they do. Nobody understood how a mistake this drastic could have happened and why nobody had a solution. For someone to add an extra line to our plan, they would have had to fucked up BADLY. They thought it was ridiculous that we were given no answers. It took a few weeks of being persistent and stubborn, but it was worth it

It was because of people who had absolutely no idea what they were doing that we were almost cheated out of over 500 bucks. This was going on for 1/2 months.

Roommate: Hi, every restaurant I click on returns an error page, and refreshing does not work. We have tried multiple computers. Is there a way to place an order or resolve this?

HelpDesk: Hello Roommate, this is HelpDesk with FoodStuffs. One moment please while we look into this for you.

HelpDesk: May I ask what error message you are receiving?

Roommate: Well That's Embarrassing Sorry to leave you hungry, we're currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please reload the page, or try again later. :(

HelpDesk: May I ask what internet browser you are using the website on?

Roommate: Both microsoft edge and google chrome were tried, and we cleared cookies already on chrome, made no difference.

Roommate: Chrome and edge were on two different computers

HelpDesk: May I suggest you try using the app?

(this is not a helpful solution, this is just avoiding the problem altogether. However, we did so, only to run into another issue.) 

Roommate: Alright, neither of the two of us trying to order had the app downloaded, but we downloaded it and tried it there. It says that the restaurant we were trying to order from, Burrito, is closed. We just called them and they are apparently open until 4am. Half an hour ago the restaurant was available on the browser, I'm not sure if this is an issue with the app or what is going on.

HelpDesk: May I ask what address you are placing your order from?

Roommate: \*More Specific Address\*

Roommate: It still says they are unavailable for delivery, only giving us the option to preorder on the app

HelpDesk: I am afraid the restaurant hours on our network says they are open 11:00 AM - 2:45 PM as there holiday hours.

HelpDesk: But they are available for advance orders.

(Which, if you look back, is the exact opposite of what they just said.)

Roommate: I thought you just said they are online and available for delivery?

Roommate: We called them and they are open.

HelpDesk: They are available for advance orders.

Roommate: If they closed at 2:45 they wouldn't have been available half an hour ago.

HelpDesk: Please be advised there holiday hours are 11:00 AM - 2:45 PM fro today.

HelpDesk: Is there anything else we can assist you with?

(we give the restaurant a call, and find out from the owner that, no, they are still open, and are a bit confused themselves why the services representative is telling us otherwise. She instructs us to reach back out to them, and get them to call her)

Roommate: According to the restaurant, they are open until 4am and did not update their hours for the holiday. The owner of the store says that you should call them as that should not be the case, they are delivering until their usual time tonight. They are not happy that their delivery service is being interrupted.

Roommate: Quite frankly this is unprofessional and makes me hesitant to use FoodStuffs if the service is as unreliable and cannot problem solve as demonstrated tonight

838,wolfgang239,0,t3_ab5ox2,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ab5ox2/good_deed_of_a_convience_store_employee/,"So this happened just this past Friday.

I was heading to work and I stopped in at a convenience store to pick up my lottery tickets and a few things for my shift that night.

I get to the register and put my card in to pay and it is declined. 

we try it 3 times and its declined each time.

Now there is a line of people behind me, im in my security uniform and im now going to be late for work.

The put the transaction on hold and i run to the ATM to get money, it will show me the balance i have but when i try to get money out it says ""transaction failed"".

Im pissed off and freaking.

So i ask the clerk to hold the stuff for a moment while i run home and grab a different card from a different account and i run home (i live a block away from this store) and tell my Mom what happened and she fives me her card.

I run back to the store and we try it and it fails also.

Now im really pissed off, i have no money, its the beginning of the weekend, 7:40ish pm, its the start of a holiday weekend (new years) and this is going on.

Then the other clerk who was there said she will pay for it.

I was in shock, it was 11 dollars...i could see if it was like 2 dollars...but 11?

But i had to go and i thanked her and made it to work only 2 min late.

Later that night i call card services to find out what happened and right at the time i was making the payment the card serves went down and a few thousand people had the same thing happen.

Oh krap.

Well, when i got home Mom said we needed a few things from the store so once i told her what happened i took out 20 bucks and we went to the convenience store and i paid her back.

When she seen me she was genuinely surprised. I think she was fully expecting not to get paid back.

I gave her the 20 and she asked ""dont you want your change?"" i told her ""no, you helped me out so much with what you did. Thank you""

Might be her last day but i hope i at least gave her something positive to remember.",1,Good Deed of a Convience Store Employee,121

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky to have not had any close family pass away during my lifetime. However, this means I am honestly and truly unprepared for loss. I have seen friends grieve their grandparents and even consoled my dad when my great-grandma (whom I'd only met once at like 7yo) passed last year. However, earlier this year, I had to face it, though on a softer scale.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my two kitties went from frisky and hyper to completely lethargic overnight. I took her to the vet, and after x-rays, they concluded that she had something stuck in her stomach; the going guess was a small doll's shoe. We agreed to operate, because she wasn't even three years old, and they thought her prognosis looked very positive. So, I give kitty (named Sushi because she looked like nigiri) a kiss, and left her a the vet's, which is the best animal hospital in our town.

&amp;#x200B;

About 45 minutes later, I get a call that they found the object, however it's a malignant tumor. They said they could remove most of it, but that likely she'd only live for a year longer. I broke down and urged them to continue, because she was just too young to let go. They called me less than 20 minutes later, and informed me that they were unable to bring her back. Needless to say, I was destroyed. My husband had already left for work, so I went to my mum's for company as I cried for hours. My little niece, who was 3yo and didn't quite understand, said ""Sushi's gonna miss you"" (insert ugly crying)

&amp;#x200B;

However, the story gets so much better from here. The *next day*, I got a sympathy card signed by everyone who worked there. A week after that, I got a card from a charity that plants trees in the memory of lost pets, and they had planted a tree in a national forest ""in Honor of Sushi."" I went to pay my final bill when her ashes came in, and found that her cremation was comped per the hospital. I wasn't aware they would do that, and what's more, they made me a ceramic cast of her footprint with her name on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all these reasons and more, for as long as I live in this area, every animal in my care will go to this vet. They may not be the best price, nor very convenient as I'm about 20 miles away, but their customer care is quite literally the best I have ever received in my life.",1,"The Best Service Ever, for an incredibly sad reason",196
840,citizenandsaint,0,t3_aazjbl,49,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aazjbl/i_just_cleaned_everything_but_you_can_buy/,"This happened a while ago when I was in college. As a preface, I should say I worked in retail on and off through high school and college, so I try not to do the things that would drive me crazy when I worked in retail. A good example of something that bothered me was when a customer would show up right as we were closing for the night. However, as much as it bothered me, I never showed my frustration, and I would always serve the customer, even if it was a few minutes after we closed. Why? Because that was my job. 

All that to say, it was an ordinary evening at my college. I was doing some studying, and I wanted to get a coffee from the campus coffee shop. I knew they closed soon, so I hurried over so that I didn’t do the thing I just talked about. I ended up arriving 15-20 minutes before they closed. 

The barista working there was not my favorite person, but I am pretty polite by nature and always try to be friendly, even if you annoy me. Why did she annoy me? Because she had one of those names that is easily mispronounced, and she was aggressive in how she corrected you. I won’t say her real name, but imagine “Lara,” vs. “Laura.” Maybe she had RBS (Resting Bitch Face) or something, but I’ve known plenty of people who hear their name mispronounced and they either ignore it or they correct you in a friendly way, making it so you want to say their name the right way! 

Back to the story. So I show up a little close to closing, but definitely not within five or even ten minutes. I greet the barista, and I make my order. “I’m not making anything. I just cleaned up, but you can order something from the cooler.” They had a little cooler section with energy drinks and tea and stuff, not really what I was looking for. I was hoping to get a simple coffee or an Americano. Now I paused for a moment, to put myself in her position. I had worked at a deli most recently, and I knew how nice it was to clean up early and clock out as soon as we closed. That said, I knew the risks of cleaning up early, i.e., customers can show up before you close, and I wasn’t in the position to turn them away. 

I probably wouldn’t say this today (I was 18 at the time), but I was annoyed. I just responded, “You do realize you work here, right?” And then I walked away. Not my proudest moment. I grew up in the Midwest, so passive aggression is our first language. 

Anyway, that’s my story of an annoying barista and my passive aggressive response. 

Tldr; barista says she’s already cleaned up 15-20 minutes before closing, I got passive aggressive. ",1,"“I just cleaned everything, but you can buy something from the cooler”",279

I was picking through, looking for salami, and one of the salami fell out of the package. The package was obviously ripped open previously. I put the salami back in it, found what I was looking for, and brought up the opened package.

M: Well, I don't think you want me to put it back. I almost grabbed this, but I noticed it was open.

D: Well, I mean I guess I can keep it back here and see if someone will claim it.

M: Well, like I said, I picked it up, and, if I didn't see it had been opened, I might have bought it. I don't think you want me to put it back, right? Someone could have eaten it, or something?

D: Well, I'll leave it here, see if anyone is missing their meat.

M: Um, okay. Great. Have a good new year.

Like, what, I'm supposed to know what to do with this? Don't you have a policy if someone snacks on deli meat and puts it back? Did you really think someone brought it from another store?

My MIL passed suddenly two weeks before Christmas several years ago.  Due to an unsavory family member, I immediately called and froze all of her bank accounts and credit cards. 

As we are going through paperwork and trying to figure things out, we realize that the day she passed she had ordered some Christmas presents for my kids from a popular toy company with two first names. She had made the order the day she passed and it hadn't fully processed when I froze the account. 

I called the company to explain the situation and offer my card info to pay for the order. The rep I talked to was so incredibly sweet. She absolutely refused to take my card info. She told me the toys were on their way and we should consider them a gift from the company. She gave her condolences and was very kind the whole time. By far, the best company I dealt with during that horrible time. After the toys arrived, we also got a sympathy card from the company signed by the rep I had spoken to and her coworkers. My husband and I were able to give our kids Christmas presents from their grandma one last time.

843,Kathryn999,0,t3_aazscx,11,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aazscx/that_was_too_easy/,"For years I have told my family that I do not WANT or NEED a smart phone. I am not a phone person, so my good old flip phone with pay-as-you-go is sufficient for my simple needs. I have a good internet package for my iPad and laptop, so a smart phone is a waste of money IMHO.

My older brother ignored this, and this year he and his family gave me a smart phone. I actually opened the box hoping it was something else, but nope, there it is. I wasn’t thrilled, even though it was a refurbished phone, it’s still a bit pricey. And pointless for me. Plus now I have to go and get it activated. The horror.

I get to the phone company store, and as it’s only a few days after Christmas, they are busy and I have to wait, which I knew would happen, and I was fine with that. When it’s my turn, a nice young lady asks me if the phone is one of theirs. I explain that it was a gift, so I didn’t know. She says “no problem, I’ll just pop in one of our cards and see”. I am then a bit embarrassed that I hadn’t checked to see if it was even charged up, sheesh. She just gave a little laugh and said it was at 100%, my family had thought of that! Once she confirms that it is indeed a phone with them, she goes and gets a new card to put in it. She waits until she sees that it is all set, mentions that my balance is a bit low, and would I like to put some money on it while I was here? I say no thanks, I can do that at home while I am setting up the phone.

Here’s the strange part.

She was happy, polite and efficient. She did NOT try to sell me a case, accessories, or sign me up for an expensive plan.

I stopped in at a chain that offers breakfast stuff, breads, and lunch stuff. My husband loved a certain kind of bagel they make so I thought I’d pick him up some as a treat. I get in line and eventually make my way to the front. The guy behind the counter asks what I’d like and I say a bakers dozen of the favorite bagel. The menu above the cash register offers this option and of course it means 13 bagels. It even says this on the menu. So the guy starts filling a big bag with the favorite bagel. Whenever I order a bakers dozen I always watch and count as the bagels go in, not because I mistrust them. It’s just my habit and I have never not received the right amount. This time as I’m counting he gets to 9 and brings me the bag. I say wait you only put 9 in that bag. I asked for the bakers dozen. He looks pissed that he is caught and goes back to add more bagels to the bag. This time I definitely count the bagels going in. He gets to 12 and stops. As he hands me the bag I say wait! I ordered the bakers dozen and you only put 12 in. Now he assumes a look of total superiority and says in a snotty tone “a dozen is 12”. I say yes you are right. A dozen is 12 but a bakers dozen is 13. It says so on your sign above your head. He looks at me like I’m trying to trick him. then his co-worker standing right next to him says “she’s right, dude”.  Needless to say he was pissed, but I got all 13 of my bagels.

845,BigBerthaCarrotTop,0,t3_ab0ank,15,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/ab0ank/incompetent_money_hungry_veterinarian_and_the/,"This ended up being long. Sorry. TLDR at the bottom. 

In August I adopted a new puppy from my local shelter. They suggested to do a health check up within the first two weeks of bringing him home just to get a second opinion, and if something was wrong I could take him in to their vet with the diagnosis and they’d cover the cost. On top of that, they gave me a coupon to make the check up free at certain clinics. 

Well sadly none of the clinics had an opening in that time frame, and within the first week home he ended up biting his own male parts and left a wound. While looking around for other vet options I saw an ad for the vet in the pet store saying they offered a free first visit too! I checked their availability and they had an appointment same day so I booked it. 

Now I had all the paperwork from the shelter with me. Everything that said he had been neutered, had his shots, and had been dewormed. I am also pretty young, early 20s, and look younger without makeup. I have worked in animal shelters for 4 years, so while I’m definitely not up to a vet standard I do know the basics about common illnesses and problems seen in dogs. (This is all important)

The vet scans over the paperwork and tells me he’s due for shots. No he’s not. The paperwork said he just had a round 10 days ago. “Oh well we do them every three weeks here”. Okay.. 10 days doesn’t equal 3 weeks. He’s fine. His tech is even trying to tell him the same thing but he schedules the shots into the system anyway. Wtf? 

Then he tells me he has to be dewormed. No.. the shelter already did that. “Well do you know how worms work? They are passed from the mom. We need to at least do a test to see if he has them.” Again, both I and the tech mention the shelter already did all that. He inputs doing it into the computer anyways. Dude, seriously?! 

I mention my concerns about the wound on his peen and ask about how to calm his stomach that is upset from a non-transitional food change. The vet loses his freaking mind. “Your dog has Parvo! We need to do a test IMMEDIATELY!!” I look at him like he’s insane. I know what parvovirus looks like. I worked in a shelter! My dog just had the shits! And he’s already been vaccinated for it!! I told him my dog does not have Parvo, I’ve treated and lived with dogs who have Parvo. He’s far too WELL to have Parvo. I’m just worried of the dehydration and expelling of nutrients that comes with the diarrhea and was looking for advice since I usually treat it with rice and boiled chicken but this dog has a grain allergy.. 

Finally we get him to back off about the Parvo thing and he looks at the wound. “This looks like a dog bit him. Do you have another dog at home? You need to keep them away from each other! Is the other dog up to date on his vaccines?!” Guys I lost it. Yes a dog bit him, because he bit himself! I watched him do it! 

The vet ended up getting frustrated with me and leaving me with the Tech to go over everything he wanted done during that visit. It was close to $1000 worth of stuff that DIDN’T NEED TO BE DONE! 
Luckily the Tech was super nice and understood the Vet was being an idiot about it all. (And possibly trying to take advantage of what he assumed was a young, first time dog owner who didn’t know anything.) 

I walked out just spending $50 for my dogs meds and cone of shame. We never went back to the vet in the pet store, and hardly even go to that pet store as well. It’s been 5 months, Puppy is a large, healthy 45lb bully breed mutt. Never had Parvo, and never had worms. Never was bit by another dog. 

TL;DR. Vet tried to convince young adult that puppy was dying. Had Parvo, worms, was bit by another dog, and needed a full work up costing about $1000. Young adult wasn’t an idiot and didn’t fall for it. Puppy was/is fine and completely healthy. ",1,"Incompetent, Money Hungry, Veterinarian and The Puppy Who Was Fine.",70

It's a little long, so hold onto your butts.

## Background
---

For the past year, I've had a subscription to Banana Music and loved it. I decided that I wanted to give another streaming music service a try and signed up for a three-month Premium trial for Dotify and liked its features and offerings a bit more. Naturally, the only downside is not being able to use Miri on my iFruit X to actually pick and play songs on Dotify, but that's a minor inconvenience.

I cancelled my Banana Music subscription, took a screenshot to show the cancellation (for record of my receipts) and I thought I was all set. Fast forward to the middle of November when I received a notification from PayFriend that I paid $9.99 to Banana. I logged in and sure enough, I was charged for another month of Banana Music, despite having cancelled at the beginning of the month. 

From my understanding, Banana charges in advance, so the $9.99 charge on November 15th for the subscription was for November 15th to December 15th. When I originally cancelled the subscription, I got a pop-up on my iFruit saying, ""If you confirm and end your subscription now, you can still access it until November 15, 2018."" Clearly there was some mistake since I already cancelled the subscription on November 7th.

Now, usually I am a very passive customer. I'm not one to cause a scene or make a fuss. If something rings up wrong at checkout, I point out the mistake politely. If the store can't or won't correct it, I'll pass (or accept regardless, depending on the price) politely and carry on. However, this was a complete fault of the company for billing me on a subscription I'd already cancelled before the next billing cycle and I was not at fault whatsoever.

---
## The Conversation
---

I reached out to Banana customer support and spoke to one of their support agents. I'll call her BS for Banana Support and...well, I'm sure you know the other.

BS: Thank you for contacting Banana! My name is BS, how may I assist you?

Me: Hi! I need to report an issue with my Banana Music subscription. I cancelled it on November 7th and took a screenshot of the cancelled subscription. However, I was charged for an additional billing cycle today when I should not have.

BS: I'm sorry to hear that you cancelled your subscription, but rest assured, I will be able to fix this for you. In order to cancel your subscription, please go to your settings in your iFruit phone and...[insert subscription cancellation instructions here.]

Now, just for the hell of it, I went into my subscriptions and sure enough, it showed up under Expired, with the date being November 15th.

Me: I've already cancelled the subscription. Like I said, I cancelled it on November 7th, I have a screenshot that shows it's been cancelled. I just looked at my subscriptions again and it shows Expired as of November 15th, so why was I charged for an additional billing cycle? Not only was I charged for the billing cycle of 11/15 to 12/15, but I don't even have access to the service. Banana billed me for something I can't even use.

BS: Can you confirm your Banana ID?

Me: [Confirms Banana ID]

BS: Allow me a moment to look into this. [5 minutes later] I can confirm that the subscription was cancelled and access to the service ended on November 15th.

Me: Right. But I was billed subsequently. I have a copy of the receipt from both Banana and PayFriend. Order ID ABC1234567, dated November 15th, for Banana Music and says, ""Renews on December 15, 2018."" I should not have been billed for this.

BS: Allow me a moment. [3-5 minutes later] It looks like you were indeed billed for the next billing cycle. I do apologize. I've gone ahead and restored your subscription for the cycle and added an additional month, free of charge. Is there anything else I can do for you?

Me: Thank you, but I did not want the service restored. I cancelled the subscription and should not have been billed again. Please remove the subscription and refund the $9.99 I was incorrectly charged.

BS: I'm sorry, but we are unable to process a refund for this in accordance to our Terms &amp; Conditions. [provides link to complete T&amp;C]

Me: I'm sorry, what? Exactly what part of the Terms and Conditions do not allow Banana Support to refund a charge that was essentially unauthorized? I cancelled my subscription, which you confirmed yourself, and acknowledged that I was billed incorrectly and in the same breath, tell me that I can't be refunded. Forgive me, but that doesn't make any sense.

BS: We are unable to process refunds for Banana Music subscriptions at this time.

Me: So you're refusing to fix your own mistake? Well, not yours, but Banana's. Banana will not rectify their own mistake.

BS: I'm sorry, I am unable to help you further with this. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Me: [dumbfounded] Well, considering I didn't receive any help period, that would be a no. [End Chat, e-mail transcript.]

In hindsight, that last line might have been a little uncalled for, but I was so flabbergasted, I literally sat there, mouth agape, catching flies.

---
## PayFriend's Involvement
---

Long story short, I logged into my PayFriend account, disputed the charge, provided the e-mail transcript of the chat session with Banana Support, the e-mail showing I was billed again, as well as the screenshot to show the subscription was cancelled and rendered inactive as of 11/15/18. I also proactively removed all payment methods from my Banana ID and iFruit X to avoid any future unauthorized charges going forward.

I woke up this morning and made some breakfast and checked my e-mail. I saw that PayFriend had e-mailed me last night informing me that the investigation was complete, the dispute was closed, decided in my favor, and the $9.99 refunded.

Yeah, I know. It seems like a bit of a fuss over $10. Sure, I could have just accepted the reactivation plus a free month, but it's the principle of it. Now, I'll use that $10 to top up my gas tank or get breakfast on the way to the office tomorrow morning.

Then a few hours later, I got an email from paypal saying that they had charged me the equivalent of 2 months. I checked and sure enough, they had issued the refund, then apparently changed their mind and charged me for 2 months. 

When I contacted them again, they did refund those two months again, but they did it with a canned message about how subscription fees weren't refundable (which I knew and had only asked to see if they could make an exception). It was one of those ""You need to read the terms of service"" kinds of messages meant to make you feel bad. But they didn't bother to acknowledge that they had recharged me without authorization. 

So, yeah, if a company agrees to refund you and cancel your account, make sure you also remove them immediately from the recurring subscription on paypal or they can charge you again. Lesson learned. ",1,Very fishy tactics from an online subscription.,29

I had been shopping, and unknowingly left my bank card at a shop.  It was my last purchase of the day so I didn't notice until the next day when I went to buy something.  I retraced my steps, went back to the shop only to be told that because I hadn't come back before they closed, they had called my bank and had the card cancelled.  I was really shaken as I didn't know a shop could do that.  

&amp;#x200B;

My problem? I was going away to Cork the following day, and I had no cash on me and now no bank card.  So I did what anyone would do.  I called my bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up speaking to a guy who was obviously having a bad day as his replies were curt and yes/no.  I asked how could I access my money without a bank card and he told me I couldn't.  He also told me there was no way I could get an emergency card in such short time.  Again, I asked that there must be a way to get my money and how was I going to be able to on vacation without any.  His reply was an angry 'well you shouldn't have lost your card then'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh my gosh. That upset me so much I hung up on him. And that is something I never do. I'm a mouse, meek and mild and I usually just roll over and take what's given.  But not this time. I was livid.  So I took a few moments to calm down and I called back.  I got someone else, a woman this time and I explained what had just happened.  Thank god for the 'this call may be recorded' thing that banks do because she said she would have the call reviewed and ensure it never happened again. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for my money? All I had to do was go to a branch with my old card and my passport and I could withdraw money at the bank.  Easy peasy.  I did that, and had a lovely few days in Cork.

I was told by a very unenthusiastic member of staff that they don't keep either of these in stock for my car. Surprised at this, I just buy a Spark Plug T-bar Spanner and drive over to another car parts company to buy the plugs and leads.

When I get home, I leave my car for an hour to cool down. I pop off the spark plug leads and squirt a bit of WD-40 on each of the spark plugs to make it easier to undo them.
I start using the T-bar that I've just bought from Big H, and as I turned it I heard something crack. 
For a moment, I thought I'd snapped the spark plug off which would have been annoying. 
Nope. The top of the T-bar just snapped, with the tool only being held together with the blue plastic coating.

So I pop the leads back in and drive back to Big H to return this crappy tool.

I'm served by another member of staff who looked as if she'd had about 3 hours sleep.

I explain that the tool has broken off in my hand and I'd like a refund.
Because the tool is still holding together because of the plastic coating, she looks at it and asks me 

**""Sorry, what's wrong with it? It's broken??""**

So I hold the end of the tool and turn it which shows the handle is loose, making the tool unusable.
She still doesn't understand. She looks at the differential joint at the end which allows some flexibility near the socket.

**""So it's not meant to do this?""** she says as she looks at the tool puzzled.

Frustrated, I gesture for her to hand the tool back to me. When she does I pull the handle free from the tool, breaking the plastic coating which is the only thing holding it in place.
I hand it back to her and show her that the steel has snapped off at the handle.

The member of staff next to her overhears our conversation and looks over at the tool which is now in two pieces and says to me

**""Hold on, did you just break that? You can't return that if YOU just broke it""**

Obviously, there's no way I could have snapped a steel bar which is about 5mm thick.

I look at him and show him the broken steel bar. Again, I have to slowly explain that I simply broke the plastic coating to demonstrate that the steel bar snapped as I was trying to undo the spark plug from the engine.

**""Yeah, but is it meant for that?""** he asks me.

I sigh before telling him that considering it's called a Spark Plug Spanner, I don't know what else I should have used.

Eventually, the girl who's serving me issues me with a refund. As I walk away, her male colleague is still holding both pieces of the tool and inspecting them carefully.

I'm still not sure if he believed that the tool was so badly made that it broke off when I used it, or whether he thinks I'm related to the Incredible Hulk.",1,"""Did you just break that?""",68

This was December of 2016 and I was 18 fresh out of basic training and right on to Korea. Me being new to being on my own account, made some unwise spending decisions which gradually led to my demise. 

I went to go get food and was told my card was declined, embarrassed I laugh it off and say that I have been having trouble with that store’s system as I walk out. I then go to check my account and see that all of the money I thought I had was spent on plenty of streaming services subscriptions and other places that I knew 100% I hadn’t spent money at or would even need to make those purchases. So initially I am raking my brain trying to figure out if I had done something wrong or binge spend, I then went to check my declined transaction and see a $900k attempted purchase along with several other big attempts. 

So now I call my bank and this is where the system just didn’t help us achieve a timely goal. I am asked to verify myself with a pin number given from the app that is attached to your account once you activate mobile banking. I opened the account in the states and I guess when I changed SIM cards it also mixed the pin (I wish I could explain that process in detail). Christmas was approaching, my next pay check was approaching (which i wouldn’t have had access to at the rate of the process), and my food supply was gone (dining facility was under construction). 

I am calling my bank everyday multiple times a day if time allowed and this was the conversation. 

B: Could you please give us your pin provided on the mobile app? 

Me: ######.

B: Ok that was incorrect and we are locked out of your account, could you please call back in a hour?

B: Sir, could you verify full name and birthday?

I’m also not very good a storytelling so please bare with me.


I’m a recovering addict and recently celebrated 3 years sober. I haven’t had a drop of alcohol in 3 years, until tonight. It’s my husband and I second wedding anniversary and decided to have a nice night out together and left our two year old with my sister for the night. It’s very rare we have a night alone. 


So we decide to do hibachi (a big hibachi chain) for dinner, and ordered our drinks. (Both drinks non alcoholic, my husband is a recovering Alcoholic and is sober as well) I ordered a strawberry lemonade, my husband a soda. So our drinks come and mine is in a different type of glass but I just figured it was because I ordered a specialty lemonade. I took a big swig and it was something STRONG. I got a full gulp of booze. I was like holy shit that’s liquor. My husband was like are you kidding me?? I literally got a small buzzed off of that sip that’s how strong the drink was. (Not to mention I haven’t had a drop in 3 years, so I’m obviously a light weight at this point) 
So the waitress comes back and we tell her this is alcohol and I ordered a lemonade! She was like oh I thought you ordered a LONG ISLAND ICE TEA! We were like uh no... can we please just get the lemonade. So I was basically forced into technically breaking my 3 years of sobriety. My husband kissed me a little while after and was like you smell like liquor still.


We didn’t want to cause a scene at the table because our table was mixed w a family and their young kids, so my husband waited until we finished eating and let the manager know what happened. The manager was apologetic but didn’t do anything like comp a meal or free desert etc. honestly we weren’t looking for any of that anyway, but just wanted to let him know what happened. Thank god I’m secure and good in my sobriety or that could of been a major disaster. It’s been an extremely long and hard road for my husband and I both to get to where we are today with our addictions. 

Edit: just to clarify we 100% get it was a mistake and did not want the waitress to get in trouble or fired etc. we were still very nice and polite and tipped her well. We just felt it needed to be brought to managements attention because of the severity of the situation.

857,[deleted],0,t3_aan4dp,7,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aan4dp/i_just_want_the_pig/,"This happened about a week before Christmas. I've been feeling really down as the year came to an end, but the one thing that has made me smile, no matter what, is this toy pig outside my boss's office. Think of a squeaky toy, but instead of a high-pitched squeak, it lets out a low grunt like an actual pig would make (this is achieved by having a tube through the entire length of the toy, instead of a short piece at the mouth). The toy itself is Christmas themed, meaning that the pig has a Santa hat, coat, and boots. I knew that when the season was over, the pig would not be around the office any more, so I went on a quest to get one myself, and stat. 

I looked up the pig online by searching some of its qualities and noticed that a store that normally focuses on clothing was selling the toy as a novelty. Unfortunately, I could either order it online or drive an hour to the nearest store that had them in stock. I didn't want to wait to get my emotional support pig, and I typically don't trust online shopping, so I decided I would take a trip to this store and pick it up there. 

I checked after my shift to make sure that the pig was still in stock, and the website said that this location had 2 left. I made the hour trip there after changing out of my work clothes, and searched the entire store not once, not twice, but three times. I asked an associate who was working the sales floor if she had seen the pig or what section I could search more thoroughly. She led me to a kiosk and had me pull up the pig on it, enter my information, and insert my debit card into the chip reader. 

At this point, I figured ""Great! I paid for it, and they're going to go grab it and hand it over to me at the customer service desk or something."" Wrong. Apparently I drove an hour out of the way so that I could order this toy online, something which I didn't want to do in the first place, and I missed out on a discount that was available on the website because it was done in-store. I explained this to the associate, and she just shrugged her shoulders and wandered off to another part of the store. 

I made another round through the store, specifically looking at the sections that had Christmas displays, but still had no luck, so I went to the customer service desk. The associate working the desk was very nice about it, but she couldn't find it either. She could also see two in inventory, but since it was a generic item, there wasn't a particular section of the store it could be in. She made a few calls on her walkie talkie but no one was able to find it that she had called. Finally, she looked at the brand and suggested that it was in the men's section (the other end of the store) but if it wasn't there, she wasn't sure where it could be. 

I half-heartedly searched the men's section, but I knew it wasn't there since I had checked tons of times. As I was walking out, I saw two employees stocking a display in the middle of the walkway that circled the store. They were making comments about some customer who was looking for a novelty toy pig, and implying that no one would want to buy something like that, and that only a person who isn't entirely right in the head would want one. While this made my blood boil a little, I decided to have some compassion because hey, it's Christmas, right? The bittersweet part of it was while I wasn't able to get the pig that night, I knew that it would be shipped to me in two days and I would have it before Christmas. 

So far, the morals of the story are:

1) Don't advertise a product and then act surprised when people show up to buy it.

2) If you're going to talk smack about the customer, make sure they're out of the building, or at least not right in front of you.

3) You might not think that it's that big of a deal, but to someone who's going through a rough time, that slight thing that makes them smile and brings the the tiniest bit of joy gets them through whatever they're dealing with. Just let people enjoy things and don't try to shame them for it.

858,thidwickthemoose,0,t3_aaeq0y,138,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aaeq0y/well_that_was_fun/,"This morning I was balancing out my bank account. I realised that around $400ish dollars seemed to be missing. 

So, I called my bank for help after going through the account several times and not seeing it. I gave the teller all of the information that I had, explained this didn't seem to be balancing out, and asked for help going through my ACH history and ensuring there was nothing pending or any holds, etc. 

I was put on and off hold several times and was really nice about it. I kept telling them thank you, no problem, take as much time as you need etc. Honestly, it was a break for me. Hubby was in charge of our 4 boys and I was reading in our bedroom with the speaker phone on. 

So it ends up being a mistake on my end. I misread the originator of a different deposit. The $400ish dollars HAD been deposited. The shortage was actually a payroll error on my husband's direct deposit (he was shorted pay) and happened to be nearly the same amount as my deposit that I thought had not been deposited. So I was right about there being an error but not where it came from.

I apologised profusely and told them I was very sorry, that I would get in touch with my husband so he could reach out to his payroll department, and told them that I really appreciated their help and that it did help me figure out what was wrong.

I was hanging up with the teller and she said goodbye and thought she had hung up, but she didn't. I heard her speaking still, so I l listened thinking she needed to tell me something else.  I hear this:

BT for Bank Teller:

BT: Well THAT was fun. What an idiot. This stupid bitch doesn't even know how to look at her bank account. 

She hung up then and I sat there for a minute kind of stunned. I usually just let stuff go especially because I am really nonconfrontational.  But I was actually a bank teller and accounts manager for several years which is why I was so patient in the first place. I just couldn't believe what I had heard.

So, I called back. She was the one who answered. 

Me: Hi. This is Thidwick. I just spoke to you a moment ago about my account.

BT: Oh. Right.

Me: Did you realise that you did not hang up the phone and I could hear what you were saying about me?

BT: *silence*

Me: That was so incredibly rude and unprofessional. I apologised to you and thanked you for your time. Yes, I did make a mistake. I admitted it and I felt silly. But your attitude is so uncalled for. 

BT: Yeah, well I had to call TWO departments to figure it out!

Me: You realise that IS your job right? I had a problem, wasn't sure how to solve it or where the error was and called you for that reason. Helping me solve it and double checking with the right people is what you're paid for isn't it?""

BT: But then it was a waste of time!

Me: I really don't think figuring out the issue and discovering a payroll issue is a waste of time.

BT: Whatever. Merry Christmas.

Me: I'd like to speak to your manager please.

BT: No. She's on vacation. 

Me: Okay. Then I will be calling back and letting her know my concerns. 

BT: *huuuge sigh* Happy Freaking Holidays. BYE!

By this point I was pretty irritated and couldn't resist.

Me: Happy Holidays. Better be more careful with that phone!

TL;DR
Bank account wasn't balancing out. Called bank for help. Teller didn't hang up phone and I heard her call me a stupid bitch. Called back to tell her she was unprofessional and rude. She continues being rude, I couldn't resist a parting shot.

I'm in a local donations-for-sale store with my dad, and my SO. We get a few things, one of the items (I'm sorry this was years ago, I can't remember exactly what said item was, but it was something like an ashtray or salt shaker...something stupid cheap and looked cool) happens to be $.59 along with a couple other things, our bill should be in the $7-8 range. We had a couple duplicate items, cashier rang it up as quantity x price. She gets to the last thing, the 59 cent item, and continued to ring in quantity x price and charges us 10x for the 59 cent item (so now the receipt says we purchased 10 of the 59 cent items when in fact there was only 1 and no description of the item on receipt either, just numbers. I was distracted at the time by my girl who called me over to look at some dress or something so my dad payed). Didn't realize what happened til we got home maybe 2 miles away, and I promptly returned to the store. Me = me, cashier = c, manager = mic

Me: hi, I was just here, you remember me right? I was with my dad and girlfriend.

C: sure, what's wrong?

Me: you charged us 10x for one item, I'd just like my money back please. (Just like to point out, I may or may not have been involved in some illegal activities in which I participated in to survive essentially. I wasn't making crazy money but $5 and some change wasn't shit, but it was the principle)

C: do you have your receipt?

Me: sure do. .:points to discrepancy:.

C: ok, do you have the item?

Me: no, I left it home, I want the item, I just didn't want to be charged 10x for one thing.

C: ok, sir, you have to have the item.

Irritated, I reluctantly return home for the item in question, and promptly return to the store, again.

Me: I'm back with the item, here's my receipt.

C: ok, I can't do refunds, let me page the manager.

After 3 failed pages and ten minutes go by I start looking like Sonic the Hedgehog when you stop playing for a minute but don't pause it - if you know, you know. If you don't, may God have mercy on your fortnite playing soul. Finally, the manager comes out, shuffling towards the register as slow as possible, now just about everyone in the store is at the checkout line where this is taking place. Manager saunters over and asks the cashier the issue. Cashier tells her I want my money back, but I don't have the 10 items she charged me for, at which point I interject to correct her.

Me: she charged me for 10 at 59 cents but I only had the one, it's a simple error, she entered an extra 0 when calculating the cost. I just want to keep my item, and be refunded 9x.59

Mic: I can't do that, sir.

Me: (as polite as I could be) why not? You're the manager, right? I waited ten minutes for you to come from the back (where she was likely taking a nap or smoking, tbh it kinda looked like the former) and all I want is the money back from the mistake she made. It happens, I understand, but I would.kike the error corrected.

Mic: well, sir, you don't have all the items she charged you for, if you want the refund you'll have to give us back the 9 other items. (Cause my cashier isn't human and doesn't make mistakes, right?)

At this point I'm fuckin' furious. The rage consumes me. I can't hold it in anymore, I snapped, and the customers got a show, fr. I had driven to the store 3x to get this shitty $5 and change back, wasted $5 in gas, but hey, it's the PRINCIPLE, amirite? I grew up with a bunch of Italians, so I'm well versed in the delicate art of cursing a motherfucker out. I almost feel bad for the cashier, but my beef wasn't with her at this point, it was with the louzy excuse for a manager (that may I remind you, runs a store in which DONATIONS are taken in, and sold for a profit. Is that $5 going to ruin her bonus? I think not.) 

Now what exactly was said I don't really remember but it went something like this-

Me: Are you fucking kidding me? What fuckin part didn't you get? I don't have 10 of the same fuckin thing, she just charged me 10 times for ONE fuckin item. You want me to magically pull 9 fucking items out of my ass? Are you fuckin stupid? Just give me my money back. 

Mic: now I'm definitely -

Before she could finish I just kept going..

Me: you know what? Go fuck yourself you stupid cunt. You think I give a fuck about the money? It's the fucking PRINCIPLE! (I reach in my pocket and pull out a WAD of money, the gasps are audible as the roll was probably +1k. I flip through the money to where I get to the Lincoln's, after all them Jackson's and a couple Grants.. I can hear the audience of customers thinking - wow, what am I witnessing here?) I don't give a fuck about $5 you stupid bitch!

Then it happens, the Powermove. I shove my wad back into my pocket, keeping the $5 out, and with my other hand reach into my pocket and pull my lighter out (the collective gasp happens again). Still cursing the manager out, I light the bill on fire, walk away, still cursing her out, hop in my van and take off. Pretty sure I heard the one guy in the line say ""Worldstar!""

I recommend at least one time, if you have the money, burn it in front of someone (preferrably a crowd). The look on their face is priceless.

TLDR; got grossly overcharged for a 59 cent item. Spent $10 in glorious fashion to get my pettyrevenge.

Myself, my sister, my cousin and his paternal grandmother all trooped out to this place to try it out. We're standing in the queue and someone in front of us is arguing with the server.

As I was waiting for my ride, a lady at the info desk asked for my help; she couldn’t log into her email and we spent a lil while figuring it out on her iPad. We had a bit of a chat and she was really nice! She thanked me profusely when we were done.

Later, I was suddenly told that my bf’s mother wasnt able to come. She was busy &amp; had called someone else to come get me, but then THEY called me and told me they couldn’t come get me either. My bf was at university; he didn’t have a car. I didn’t have money for an Uber or a lyft. I didn’t want to contact my parents for the fear that they might’ve forced me back. 

Again, I was so broken. I was panicking. I pulled over a suitcase and a duffel of the last things I owned into a corner and just started sobbing. I felt so trapped and helpless; perhaps I’d spend the night at the airport. I didn’t have any food, but I could probably last.

Then the lady from the info desk suddenly appeared. She gave me a small smile and handed over a cold water bottle &amp; a bunch of candy.

“Are you okay?” she asked. “Do you need any help?”

I said I would be okay but she wouldn’t go until I insisted. Even then, she promised me that she was at the desk and that if I needed anything, I could go to her. I thanked her and she went back.

Later, someone somehow figured out a ride for me and as I was leaving, she gave me a huge smile and a wave. I’d never expected someone to shed kindness on me—especially not then. It doesn’t seem like much, but she gave me hope.

So info desk lady, you saved my life. You gave  me a little light to hold on to. I’m okay now &amp; I have a home. Thank you.

Edit: I’ve experienced immense and severe physical/emotional/verbal abuse from both parents for all 18 years of my life. This is not abnormal in my household. It wasn’t the first time. It happened often bc my parents don’t know how to control their anger. I’m not a bad kid; no drugs or alcohol, good grades, good school, I hang out w good people. Imma tell y’all rn that there is absolutely nothing that will EVER give a parent a reason to lay their hands on the child, to throttle them and slap and punch and kick them until they’re bleeding and bruised. Thanks.

Also: the amount of kind words and attention this lil story has gotten is astonishing, and I’m immensely grateful for it. Thank you for being so kind. Kindness truly goes a long way. Keep sharing your stories. They matter.",1,airport ipad lady saved my day,1740
864,basic_white_bread,0,t3_aab1t1,78,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aab1t1/when_a_cheeseburger_is_not_a_cheeseburger/,"This happened a little while back, I just found this sub and thought it would fit since this is the most ridiculous interaction I’ve ever had as a customer. I’ll preface this by saying I’m not a fussy person, especially when it comes to fast food. To me it’s all pretty much the same and as long as I get something that is sort of close to what I ordered I’ll just eat it and go on about my life. 


One day I had to work late and knew I wasn’t going to have time to cook so I stopped at a fast food place on the way home. I was getting food for my whole family – a nugget value meal for my daughter and cheeseburger value meals for me and my husband. They handed me the bag and it felt pretty light considering I was supposed to have three meals. Like I said I’m not fussy about this stuff so most of the time I don’t even check the bag, but since it felt so light I thought I’d better look. Turns out they had forgotten the two burgers, all I got was three fries and the nuggets. So I wait for someone to come back to the window and wave to get their attention. The lady comes back to the window and I explain, she’s kind of snappy but they’re probably busy so I ignore it. She takes the bag from me, closes the drive through window, and walks away. I don’t think this is a big deal, it happens sometimes and they’ll just fix it like they always do. 


Then she comes back holding the bag and I reach for it but she holds it back and says “What was the problem again?”


I say “I’m missing two cheeseburgers”


Her: “You didn’t order any cheeseburgers”


Me: “I did. I ordered a number whatever and two number whatev- “


Then she interrupts me to bark “LET ME SEE YOUR RECEIPT!”


I find it, hand it to her, and she *snatches it from me*. I’m normally pretty calm but I’m starting to get mad. I had not been rude with her in any way, I had a valid complaint that is very easy to correct, there’s no reason to act like a cunt about it. 


She looks over the receipt then leans through the window a little bit and in a very rude and loud tone says “THERE’S. NO. CHEESEBURGERS. ON. THIS. RECEIPT.”


So I’m mad because of her attitude but at the same time I’m confused because I don’t know what she’s failing to understand here. I didn’t think to look at the receipt before I gave it to her, maybe the person taking the order made a mistake.  So I just say “Well that’s what I ordered and I paid $25 which is more than what nuggets and fries cost, so clearly something is mis-“


And she interrupts me again, this time she’s straight up yelling “YOU DIDN’T ORDER ANY CHEESEBURGERS!”


So I start yelling “Look lady, I’m not trying to scam you out of two cheeseburgers. I’m just trying to get what I paid for and I don’t know what your problem is…” I’m yelling, she’s yelling over me “And I TOLD YOU that you DIDN’T ORDER ANY CHEESEBURGERS”. It’s a fun situation. At this point we’ve caused enough of a scene for other workers to come see what’s going on. A younger lady takes the bag and receipt from the rabid cunt, tells me to hold on a second, and they all walk off out of sight.  The younger lady comes back alone and sheepishly asks “When you say ‘cheeseburger’, do you mean quarter pounder with cheese?”


Bull fucking shit. I did not just get screamed at by this fucking lunatic because she couldn’t piece together that a quarter pounder with cheese is a type of cheeseburger. Besides that, I did specify that they were number whatevers, and if she hadn’t been so busy being an asshole and interrupting me then she would’ve known that from the beginning. I get that because they work with this stuff all day they’re used to the specific burger terminology, but this was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary. 


To the younger lady I say “Are you serious? All this because I called them cheeseburgers instead of quarter pounders?”


She just apologizes and gives me the corrected order. I thank her and tell her I’m sorry if I upset anyone besides the first lady. Then I went home and ate my fucking *cheeseburger*. No exciting revenge or anything. I thought about calling the manager the next day but decided not to since I did end up yelling at her too, and I probably didn’t have to do that even though it seemed like the thing to do at the time. Besides, if she gets that pissed off over the word cheeseburger then her manager has enough to deal with.

I was not prepared for the prices. 

In the time it took me to figure out nothing in the store was in my budget, the sales associate helping me, we’ll call her Rachael, had at that point lost out on helping other people who were more likely to buy something. I’m not sure how it works there, but I figured sales associates got a commission, especially during he holidays. 

I didn’t want to just leave, Rachael was super helpful and informative, and I respect any sales person who knows the product and can passionately tell me what I need to know about it. So I explained to her that I couldn’t afford anything in the store, and asked if there were some customer comment card I could fill out online to leave a glowing recommendation about her for all her help. 

She did not know how to respond to that.

The thing is the $50 charge was for a claim from back in April and I was under the impression that I had already paid all the out pocket charges associated with the April claim. I've called the billing office number twice and both times they've told me they'll call me back with no response so far.

I've tried calling other numbers for the medical supply company, but each time they keep referring me back to the office on the statement who hasn't contacted me back. I ordinarily wouldn't care so much if they weren't going to auto draft it on Jan 2 and it wasn't a Friday and we have New Year's coming up.

The cynic in me just can't help but think they sent out the statement so late in the month on purpose so as to keep from being able to address it until after they auto draft had already been made. And the clock is continually ticking. They close at 4PM.  Isn't that grand? :-) So anxious and frustrated right now.

UPDATE - So I finally got a hold of a representative and figured out what happened. So they only applied $60 of my $140 to my out of pocket costs. They other $80 they kept on the account as a credit.  As CPAP owners know, when you buy a new CPAP with insurance the medical supply company ""rents"" you the CPAP for a certain amount of months and they file a claim with your insurance every month until the amount of months has passed. My monthly out of pocket for this ""renting"" arrangements was roughly $13 a month. I thought (and I was told by the local sales office) that they would deducting that $13 from my debit card every month during my ""renting"" months. Come to find out that instead of charging my debit card the $13 every month they just deducted the $13 from the $80 credit that was left over on my account. I confirmed on my online bank account that they had never charged me the $13 as I just assumed they were doing. So long story short, the local sales office did a bizarre application of my original $140 which is why I still have a balance of roughly $50. Not sure why they did that, but at least I know that the charges are correct and they're not trying to double dip.",1,Medical supply company is going to charge my credit card on Jan 2 for something I think I already paid,18

872,giggityweeee,0,t3_aa505v,10,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aa505v/got_banned_from_an_airport_shuttle_company_not/,"So this happened 7ish years ago, long before Uber Lyft or any other service of the like was around (important). I was a junior in HS and it was Christmas break. I lived in Austin Texas and was going to see family with my mother in Houston. My very serious bf was visiting his grandmother in a small town about an hour outside of Dallas, it would be just the two of them over Christmas and New year's. Well he really wanted me to come for New year's for the company and to meet his grandmother. 

So we arranged it, I would take a bus from Houston to Dallas after Christmas and his grandmother, with him, would come pick me up and take us back to her house an hour away since neither of us had cars. Then after New year's she'd drive us back to Dallas where we'd catch a bus back to Austin.

Me getting there all went well and we had a great New year. Well on the 1st his grandmother was feeling ill and got worse as the day progresses. We were supposed to leave on the 3rd and by then she was still too ill to drive us. It was some flu, not life threatening, but she didn't feel up to the 2 hour drive. 

So here we were stranded in this small town with no way to get home to Austin, there was no bus or public transportation to take us to Dallas from where we were and we no one other than his grandmother in the area. And since it was before UBERs time that was not an option either.

We started researching for anything that would get us to Dallas. Well we found an airport shuttle service that I honestly don't remember the name of now. For a pretty hefty fee they'd pick you up and take you to the Dallas airport. I called them up and first asked if they would take us somewhere else other than the airport even if it cost extra. Nope, okay I can work with that, take this shuttle to the airport and then catch a cab from the airport to the bus station. I set up a pick up time. The woman on the phone asked me what airline I was with and I was honest, that we were just trying to get to Dallas and that we were stranded with no way to get there and that this shuttle service from e was all we could find that would get us into the city. She didn't give any indication that was a problem and booked us to be picked up. 

Well me and my bf later we're discussing time frame and I was worried we had booked the shuttle too late to get us to where we needed to be by the bus pick up time. He said he'd call back and change the time, I went and took a shower. When I got out my bf was angry and told me that they cancelled the shuttle on us when he tried to change the time and hung up. 

I called them back and demand some information and they simply said I was not to call back and hung up on me. I called again and this time they didn't answer. 

We ended up finding another cheeper way that took us straight to the bus stop but it was a stressful night. 

I'm not entirely sure what we did wrong? If someone can explain this I'd like to know because it still bothers me. The only thing I can think of was that they found it sketchy we were going to the airport w/o a flight but I explained our situation? I just didn't find it all that odd of a request.

876,throwaway789663,0,t3_aa36o8,5,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/aa36o8/the_fruit_salad/,"Many years ago, an ex and I decided to go out to dinner to a place that I had been a couple times before and liked. Being a weeknight, we knew the place wouldn't be busy, but we didn't realize just how un-busy it would be. 

The way the restaurant is set up is that it's a two room building with the rooms divided by a wall. The main room is where all the table are and the main bar. The second room is more of a ""bar."" There is a large stage, only a handful of small tables and one large bar near the entrance. This room is used more for people who just want to listen to live music and drink. When you enter the restaurant, you enter on a platform and go down two or three steps to get to the floor. The kitchen window is to the immediate left so they are able to see anyone who walks in and vice versa. There is no hostess stand but there is a sign that says to wait to be seated, with the expectation that a server will see you and go sit you. 

We knew that since it was a weeknight, we didn't assume it would be very busy but we didn't expect there to only be two tables in the entire building. We entered the room and stood on the platform waiting to be seated. We stood there for about 3 or 4 minutes while hearing the kitchen staff talking but not seeing a single server. I know a lot of people are asking why we didn't just leave, but my ex had really wanted to try this place for himself. After about 5 minutes, a server appears from literally no where and seats us directly next to the bar. We try to ask to move to a window seat since the place was empty but she ran off before we were even able to open our mouths.  We sit there waiting to see our server longer than it took us to get seated. When the server finally came we had already known what drinks we wanted and what appetizer. We put both in and he tells us that when he comes back with the drinks, he will get our entrees. He comes back, gives us the drinks and we order. Now the entrees came with a choice of side. He decided on getting the fruit salad and I of course chose sweet potato fries. 

We sit and talk and after a while we start to wonder where our appetizer is. Looking at our watch, we realize we had been siting there for close to half an hour and we only had our drinks. Looking around we realize that not only is it impossible to find our server, it's impossible to find any server. There is literally no staff on the floor and no one to ask about the appetizer. We sit there for 10 more minutes before our server appears with, you guessed it, our entrees. When we tell him that we never got our appetizer, he simply says ""Oh, I guess I forgot to put it in."" No apology or offer of a comp off the bill and practically runs off without asking if we needed anything. A refill would have been great. 

We start to eat when my ex asks what this thing is sitting on his place. I take a look and realize were looking at his side fruit salad. A normal fruit salad is a combination of different fruits, usually cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapples, etc but apparently not to this restaurant. To our disgust, we realize *this* fruit salad consisted of a single piece of lettuce and a strawberry. To say we were unhappy would have been an understatement. Unfortunately we were not able to voice our complaints since we surprisingly couldn't find a single server, including our own. 

When the server finally materialized and cleared our plates, I finally was able to ask for a manager. Looking completely unfazed, the server went off to find him. I used to be a server and a hostess so I know how the job can be sometimes and I'm usually pretty easy going when it comes to service, but there was no excuse for that night so I was pretty damn mad. When the manager came back alone, I admit I might have laid into him. I told him about how long it took to get seated, how our appetizer never came, we saw our server a total of three times the entire stay and how our food was not as expected. He apologized profusely, but never said anything about a comp for the appetizer we never got. We decided it wasn't worth the hassle and paid the ticket but we vowed we would never go back, and we didn't. I guess the cherry on top of the poop sundae was learning my ex tipped the server a full 20% after all was said and done. I guess that was just one of the reasons he is my ex.

My story happened about a year ago. As a part of an exam I had to print a big poster with a specific paper. This means I had to have everything ready ahead of time so I can go to a print shop. Since I didn't know another local shop I had to go to a shop we will call SS (shitty shop) with their owner SO (shitty owner). 
Unfortunately SO told me they didn't have the paper anymore but it would come tomorrow. It is important to know that I asked on a Thursday morning and my exam was on a Monday. It sounded good and we arranged that I could get my poster on Saturday. But since I was a bit nervous I wanted to make sure that they could do it. I asked about 5 time and explained that in the case they couldn't do it on time I was able to place an express order in an online shop. SO was nice and asked for my number in case anything went wrong and told me that everything was fine.  Keep in mind that he told me about 5 times that my order wasn't a problem and everything is fine. Most of you can guess where this is going.

Two days later I came back and was nicely welcomed by a worker. I asked for my order and he went to look for it... 5 minutes go by and he comes back and tells my that he couldn't find anything with my name. I told him about my order, that I left my USB-stick there and everything. He just went silent and began to tell me that SO lied to me and that this was never possible. He also told me that this wasn't the first time SO did something like this and lies to his customers from time to time just so he can get the order (he can't fulfill). Since my exam was on Monday and I didn't know about another print shop I was pretty frustrated and went home.

878,sydneyterranova,0,t3_a9soyr,11,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a9soyr/no_burger_buns_mixed_up_the_orders_and_kept_the/,"So last night my boyfriend and I went to a 24 hour breakfast restaurant. We go there pretty often and because we go late at night we usually get the same server, who is PHENOMENAL (I adore this server she is always on top of her stuff and goes above and beyond for everyone). Last night we went around 10pm which was a lot earlier than we usually go. We get there and the place is pretty busy and even has a wait line. When we get seated, we place our drink order, then our appetizer, and then our entree.

This is when things start going horribly wrong. 

We waited at least 30 minutes for the burgers. When we get them, they're on toast instead of burger buns. We wouldn't have cared if the server had told us that they were out of burger buns but she didn't say a word, even when she brought it out. I most likely would have ordered pancakes had she told us just because I would have thought the toast would make it significantly messier (which it did). 

My boyfriend ordered a medium-rare burger and didn't specify how he wanted the egg. I ordered a well-done burger and said I wanted an egg over hard. My boyfriend starts eating immediately but I wanted some mayo, which I could not ask for since she ran away as soon as she gave us the food. When she comes back, I ask for mayo and she says she'll go get some. By this time my boyfriend is halfway through the burger. She comes back and tells me they're out of mayo and offers me some sauce they make in the restaurant. I say okay and she says she'll bring it to me. I waited about 5 minutes and figured she wasn't going to bring it so I start eating my burger. That's when I realize she didn't get the orders right. He had my burger and I had his. Keep in mind we didn't switch spots so it's not like that could have confused her. I can't stand medium-rare for some reason (I don't really know why I just have always hated it) but since it was so busy I just ate it anyway. I couldn't finish it because the toast with the egg with runny yolk was making such a mess, so I gave the rest to my boyfriend. 

He tried to eat it but she disappeared for another 20 minutes and he was unable to get a refill. So we sat there waiting for the check. She finally brings it and my boyfriend pays in cash. She then brings back the change, but not all of it. I'm not sure why she assumed she could keep some of the change but she did. He couldn't find anyone to talk to about it so he wasn't able to get all his change. We're both in college so money is typically tight for both of us. 

Bottom line, we paid for two burgers, got the food mixed up and not actually burgers, didn't get refills, and also did not get the full change. Am I overreacting or was this bad service?",1,"No burger buns, mixed up the orders, and kept the change",57

The customer in line ahead of me was exchanging something.  The cashier rang in the returned item, but the customer had to got get the new item to exchange.  He went to do that, and the cashier took me next.

The Cool Whip rang up at 22 cents.  I said that can't be right, and she realized the previous transaction was still open, which must have been affecting this one.  She had to void it, I said no problem.

In the new transaction, the Cool Whip was still 22 cents.  She had no idea why.  She explained it must have been priced wrong, or it was a Christmas miracle and a blessing that I should go ahead and take.  (I don't think she wanted to deal with the extra hassle of getting it priced correctly.)

881,ThomasVetRecruiter,0,t3_a9slnr,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a9slnr/a_year_long_siding_job/,"So I had siding put on my house by someone I thought was a respected company who I'll call Fears Home Improvement starting in 2017.  We had a sales person come by our house, give us the sales spiel, take some measurements, give us an estimate, and as we were okay with the price (despite it being higher than average) due to the reputation of the company, we signed the contract.

The first issue we ran into was that I was going to be leaving for a month for Military training at the end of August, so we had written into the contract that the job must be complete prior to me leaving (by August 20th).  Other than that, nothing special except for choosing the color of our siding was included.  This was in early June.  The siding wasn't actually delivered to our home until Late July.  At this point I called our ""representative"" up and asked if they would be done by the time I had to leave and he told me ""we really can't guarantee that"".  When I mentioned that I had the date in my contract he must have freaked out a bit because I got six phone calls the next day to arrange times for the crew to come out and to review the project.  

The crew did not show until August 11th.  Well actually - the crew leader showed that day to check out the house, this was a Friday and his crew was going to come Monday (the 14th).  I have an old Victorian Style house - Century plus home with a high sloped roof, two stories but effectively three with the attic and lots of detail work and lots of windows.  He told me he saw no way that they would finish on time after putting insulation down, cutting, and all the other work needed, so I called our representative again.

On Monday they got in touch with me and offered to give me a discount in exchange for moving the completion date by a month so that it would be done when I got home.  I agreed, signed some paperwork with a new end date listed and the crew started that Monday.  They were making good progress, getting everything prepped, cutting siding and ordering appropriately when just before I left we hit snag 2 (3/4, already hard to tell at this point).  The person who measured the house hadn't included an entire addition to our home so they were short material and in addition the company wanted to charge me an extra fee for the additional square footage.  I only got the cost covered by saying that ""that means our contract is void and I will walk away"".  But - the extra material would take a week to order and the crew couldn't come back until the material came in (yeah I don't get it either).  Oh well I thought, it will be done when I get back and it'll look great.

So I got back a month later and...nothing additional had been done but there was still several boxes of siding and insulation on my front lawn.  By this point I called very angry as they only had 3 days left to finish by contract and had done less than 1/4 of the house.

Other issues at this point as well - the crew left food trash under my porch.  Crew left materials in my neighbors yard.  Crew was smoking and throwing butts on my property.  A piece of wood that needed replaced was instead removed and they tried to put siding over the hole in the wall.  A piece of siding that was installed had already popped off the house due to being cut too large.  So at this point I also demanded a new crew.

The new crew leader showed up three days later and took a look at the house and told me that ""this is not at all what they described to me and I can't do this for what they offered to pay"".  So the third crew leader showed up two weeks later, cue another contract renegotiation and a new due date for the project.  They began working and then abandoned the project due to ""personal reasons"" the contractor told me it was because the company was refusing to pay them for it being a rush job.

So it's now winter, my lawn is dead, my house looks horrible still as it's half done, and we're on crew 4 and they tell me that they have to charge me more again as the area under my open front porch (about 20 feet by 8 feet wall and another 8 foot by 8 foot wall) isn't included.  At this point I call a lawyer and we send a letter telling them we're firing them and they backpedal and promise to get a crew down there to finish things and the porch is covered, and all kinds of other promises (like paying to fix my lawn).  Around here I also start getting bills from the credit department as they've already charged me as if the job is complete.

In the end, we went through 7 crews, the project was finished in May of 2018.  After the job was finished I called to talk about the lawn, discounts, etc and they told me ""you signed off, we don't have to do anything"".  So another 6 months of legal fighting back and forth we finally ended up settling.  Overall, it was the most horrendous experience I have ever had, and we're still dealing with issues today (such as the lawn not growing back/not looking entirely right, shoddy work we are still discovering, outright lies about the credit program told to us by the salesman regarding rates/payment terms, etc).  If I ever have a project like this done again, I will just pay some random guy to do it or struggle through by myself.  As a novice I assumed that using a larger company would free me from dealing with fly-by-night contractors, in the end all it meant was that they had a better legal team.

My mom and I (me for conversation purposes) are at the big box grocery store getting things to make cookies on my only day off before Christmas which was the Monday prior. Important to note it was a Monday not a crazy, busy shopping day in a big box store, just the busy day of restocking. 

We are looking for some of the tube sugar cookie dough and the aisle where they normally are is completely out. I see a lady not 5 feet away from me stocking the end of the aisle we are in. ND for I’m Not Dairy lady. 

Me: “excuse me ma’am” (this is the South y’all)

ND: looks blankly at me. 

Me: “do you happen to know if there are more of the cookie doughs displayed elsewhere on the floor? The normal aisle is empty.”

—now, I will add... I am a service industry veteran. Have been in the business for 15+ years and am currently the GM of a local gourmet neighborhood grocery/liquor store so I am not a clueless drone who has no clue what this poor lady has been put through during the holidays and I felt that I asked quite pleasantly and did not assume she should have the answer in how I formulated my question. 

ND: “I’M NOT DAIRY. YOU’LL HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE FROM DAIRY!!!!”

My mother chimes in from 5 feet away the other direction: “I found some over here!”

Me: I turn back to ND, “my apologies for bothering you, my mom found the floor display.”

ND: shrugs shoulders and turns away. 

Trust me, I know what that lady has been going through and the worst was still yet to come with the weekend before Christmas still to come at this point, but to see her react to a perfectly pleasant question like that made me angry. Not angry at her, angry at all the other customers that have been so blatantly rude to her and her coworkers because they see service industry employees as just that, servants. Be nice to your servers, cashiers, etc...they go through hell to MAYBE get one day off for Christmas and are so beat down that they can’t even fully enjoy what little time they may get with their families!

So there are a few Hell-Mart’s local to me, and my sister and I chose one that is slightly closer to home. I’d been needing a new phone case for a few months and finally decided to browse their selection of iPhone cases and screen protectors. Turns out this particular Hell-Mart locks up their iPhone accessories (I guess because people steal them?? it was strange, no other phone accessory was locked behind glass doors, iWatch accessories weren’t locked up, nothing but iPhone cases and screen protectors. just struck me as odd.) 
So i spent maybe like 5 minutes picking out what i thought would be good. this glass case that holds the iPhone accessories was (sorta) conveniently located near some cash registers and what looks like a tech help bar, with some seats for customers to sit on. My sister sat on one, and I waited until an employee looked free to assist. 
This is where I went wrong, relying on the employee’s to notice me. I didn’t say anything to them yet because i didn’t want to be annoying. 
There were three people working, one was walking back and forth from the cash register helping various people, one was cashing people out, and this third lady was doing tech support or something, she was on the phone for a while when i looked at the phone cases.
After some more time waiting, she hung up, noticed my sister sitting in front of her, and asked if we needed help. I told her i wanted stuff out of the glass case, so she asked the other two, who were now just standing behind the register talking, if they had a key. The cashier hands her the key and she mutters “I meant you could open it but okay.” She then proceeds to put the key down on the desk she was at, and get back on her computer and ignore me. 
I literally stood there with my mouth open, looked at my sister, and just walked away. 

I was livid about the whole interaction because picking out a phone case should never be that hard. 
I could’ve been more vocal about needing help, but like as soon as the one lady got the key from the cashier, I could’ve had the stuff i wanted and been out of their hair!
I also didn’t want to make a scene about not being helped, i knew that wouldn’t make anyone more willing to help.

I found a certain chain Italian place was still open near me, so I called and ordered some take out. They said “it’ll be a while” but I already assumed they’d be busy so I didn’t mind.

Walk in, and boy is it busy. I go up to the take out area and I have to wait a bit, the girl handling it is clearly very overwhelmed, but I told her to take her time. She’s handing off a very large order to this lady with a sour look on her face, and apparently forgot something simple (breadsticks, which were not quite done yet) and the lady was very irritated. Take out girl walks away and sour lady looks at me. 

Sour lady: “you know, we’ve been here a half an hour”

Me:”....okay?”

Sour lady: “it’s insane, you should just cancel your order”

Me: “well I’m just glad they’re open. I just got out of my own restaurant job so I get how crazy the holidays are. They can take as long as they want with my order.” 

Sour lady huffs and looks away. Take out girl comes back, has trouble finding my name and order, no big deal we just made a new order and I pay and give her a $20 for a $13 dollar check. So about a 50% tip, because it looks like she ain’t getting shit from the other grouches. 


I go sit and wait for my order, playing on my phone but still listening to what’s going on. This old man starts yelling at the take out girl about how long his order is taking, and blah blah blah. She looks ready to die and just tells him there’s nothing she can do about the kitchen, he seems to think there is. He comes over and sits next to me. 


Me: “you know, you should be grateful they’re even open at all”

Old man: “why, because otherwise I’d have to cook myself?”

Me: “well yes, and they should be home with their families if we weren’t all here. It’s the holidays, so of course they’re busy. There’s no need to be mean to them, it isn’t going to help.”

Old man: “well it’s ridiculous how long I’ve been waiting, I’ll do what I want. Just you wait and see how long you have to wait!”

Me: “I’m fine with that, sir, Merry Christmas.”

The take out girl and I make eye contact and she smiles. I tried, you know?

About five minutes later I hear my name called. My order is done. Magically before the angry old man. I don’t know if that was on purpose or my food was easier to make, but I can tell you it felt like karma.

While I can clean up nice, I look fairly white trash. It’s just my face, not much I can do about it, besides you know, clean up. But when I first wake up each morning, well.

Now, I’ve been staying at a really nice hotel in San Francisco for three days. I don’t really match the other clientele here, but I’m still a paying customer. 

This morning, I went out front to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the view. My hair was still in a bun, I had my pajamas on and I forgot to put on shoes first, so I was just wearing socks. It was literally when I had just woken up. 

When I went to go back inside, I was stopped. The lady asked me why I was there. Why? Because I’ve been paying for a room, and I want to go back to it?

From what I could hear, this person was trying to get a deal on the special exhibit tickets. The front desk lady told them that the deal was only available in person, and not over the phone (my grandmother got the deal over the phone, so I’m not sure why this person couldn’t).

Apparently this person didn’t like that answer, or was trying to convince the desk lady to change the policy, because for the next three-ish minutes, she said “the deal is only available in person” at least six or seven times.

For some context, this pastThursday afternoon I was supposed to pick up my grandmother from the airport at 4PM. I had recently punctured my tire(driving on a spare) so I wanted to go get it replaced before I drove up to get her. Had a few other things to do in the morning that ran late so it wasn’t until around 1:00 - 1:30PM when I was finally able to get it done. 

Went online to check out places that could accommodate on such a short window and found company “Doesn’t want my money” (DWMM). There was an appointment feature so I went through the process of selecting what tire I needed and what services I wanted them to do. At the end it asked what time I would like the appointment for, but unfortunately the closest location only had the option for 4PM. So I checked the next closest location and it gave me options of 2PM or 4PM. Perfect! There’s a slot open and if I leave now I will arrive right on time. 

So I make the appointment, get in the car, and drive over there. Now I’ll fully admit that I didn’t really expect to find something that quickly (especially on one of the busiest travel days of the year) but I chalked it up to someone cancelling their appointment and that I had lucked out and looked online at the right time. Especially considering the website didn’t let me select any time I wanted and only gave me specific choices. 

I show up at the place and walk up to the counter to let them know I’m here for my appointment. Instead of asking for any personal information his first question was, “What time did you make the appointment?”. I told him I made it roughly half an hour ago at home and he immediately got this indignant look on his face and proclaims that all the techs are busy. 

Now obviously I’m just confused at this point because in my mind I have an appointment so how can all the techs possibly be busy? 

“But I have an appointment scheduled through your website for 2PM”, I say. 

He replies, “For all I know you were outside sitting in your car 10 minutes ago when you made at appointment. You can’t just expect to make any old appointment and then walk in immediately and jump in front of everyone who’s already waiting”

Despite the fact that the very first thing I told him directly contradicted this I decided to let it go. As much as I wanted to get indignant right back it wasn’t going to suddenly make one of the techs available so it felt like a waste to push the issue. 

So I then just asked him if I could just buy the tire, to which he said sure.(seemed quite willing to take my money when it didn’t require much work on their part) I followed up asking if they’d be able to take the old tire off the rim and put the new one on at least(I can easily change a tire myself) and he said no(while giving me a look that said, “dude I just told you the techs are all busy”). 

At this point I’m quite irritated with the situation. Not because my appointment wasn’t being honored but that this employee seemed to be trying to make me look like some scumbag trying to circumvent the system just to “skip the line”.  Had he just apologized for the misunderstanding I may have still been willing to go back later but his attitude and demeanor made that a hard NO. 

Since I was already out I didn’t want to deal with looking at websites on mobile so I just did a quick search on google maps for “tire”. Found a place just a few miles down the road from the airport and was able to walk in and get serviced immediately(without a reservation mind you).  

I contacted their support and was informed that in the event of a failed appointment they were supposed to try to reschedule. They also stated that, “Your time is important, and with a reservation, you should be given first priority”. Now this leads me to believe that they prioritize appointments OVER simple walk ins. This guy seemed to be so offended by my actions that he didn’t even want me to come back as he didn’t even attempt to retain my business. As soon as he said they wouldn’t even take my old tire I just shook my head at him and walked out without saying a word.

So I’m not the employee but I’m a customer witnessing another customer. Yay. However, I have done retail as well as fast food on Christmas Eve and I know it ain’t fun.

I’m staying at my parents for Christmas. They live in a nice, quaint village in the middle of England where not a lot happens, everyone knows eachother and you can’t step outside without someone rushing over and going “HIII DUCK HOW ARE YOU??”

Mum works for the NHS and donates clothing to a charity for mums who have lost babies and want to be comfortable. She had to work today so she asked me to take a clothes parcel to the post office before noon when it closed for Christmas. No bother. 9am, I wonder into the high street and give the parcel to the post office. As I step out I decided that I fancied a breakfast cob and a cuppa from the local bakery.

The bakery has been in the village for years and is family run. They ship off bread and cakes to local retailers, as well as selling food and hot drinks during the day. In the run up to Christmas, they take a lot of orders for bread rolls, mince pies, cakes etc, and they let people know well in advance when they’ve reached their capacity of what they can produce. 

I enter the shop and standing in the queue. I’m second behind a local man who’s chatting to the staff member and wishing her a Merry Christmas, nothing out of the ordinary. Whilst I’m waiting, a large middle-aged women storms in. The staff member asks who was next and I greet her, with the rude lady giving me a filthy look and crossing her arms. Another member of staff who was in the process of putting some pasties in the oven then goes to serve the lady.

Lady: I WANT 12 cobs, those ones there.

The lady points over to a trolley of bread cobs that were being picked up later in the day by customers that had preordered them. The staff member apologies and explains this. Rude lady cuts her up.

Lady: Why did you not think to ADVERTISE this anywhere?! You’re a bakery this is absolutely ridiculous?! I’m taking my business ELSEWHERE!!

Rude lady barges past me and an older lady in the queue behind and storms over to her car. The whole time I kept thinking that the Co-Op across the ride likely had a stock of bread cobs, albeit not freshly baked ones.

I wished the staff Merry Christmas and got extra beans and sausages in my breakfast cob, so good times.",1,“What do you mean I can’t get bread on Christmas Eve?!”,1067

We are traveling in Prague and after a walking tour around the city in the cold we decided we wanted to stop and sit down in a restaurant out of the weather and the piercing wind.

The place was packed and seemed to lack sufficient staff, but that didn't upset us. It happens, we get it. Even when the waiter came up to take our order and told me to  ""put your bag some where else, I have no place to stand"", I wasn't too pissed. My bag was on the floor right next to my feet and chair leg. Sure no problem, I place it under the table.

Service slowly got better as the number of customers payed up and left and we just brushed the initial exchange off. I would even go so far as to say that the food was pretty decent for what menu price was stated as.

Now, before I go on, I would just like to explain for those that don't know, the Czech Republic is part of the EU, but they opt to keep their own currency like Sweden. As of me writing this, the Czech Krona (CZK) to € ratio is approximately 1:25.8. Meaning that for every 1€ , I can change it for about 25CZK

We had ordered 3 pizzas and 2 shots of Grappa and the waiter asked if we would like to pay in Euros. But before we could decide (we were going to travel to Germany in a couple of days and was wondering if we could spare the euros), he told us that he would charged us 77 €. Stunned, we requested to see the bill and he promptly told us that the cash register was not working (it was and he was lying), and that he could not pull up a reciept. We took the menu and calculated it ourselves: 240CZK + 240CZK + 280CZK + 2x110CZK = 980 CZK (approx. 40€). The waiter then insisted that we were given premium ""Reserva Grappa"" and that it cost 200czk each. 

Fine. 

So total was 1180CZK. Waiter then insisted that we had to add a 10% service tip on top of that. 

Fine. 

1180 x 1.1 = 1,298 CZK. Lets call it 1,300CZK. That is €52 if you take an exchange rate of 25:1. 

To get to €77 you needed to take an exchange rate of 16.88:1.... Where the hell did you get that rate, Mr Grumpy Waiter? Still had to audacity to grumble and act as though it was our fault to ask for a price stated in the menu.

A family switched tables without asking/letting any of the servers know; whaddya know, turns out the table was meant for another group. 

They were asked to move, which the dad immediately took offence to/started being difficult about. Cue foaming-at-the-mouth entitlement rage!

He marches up to the cashier/host stand, ready to demand a manager because how DARE they move his family from a table they weren’t supposed to be at!

I’m standing there just about to place my order and this prick starts aggressively berating the server, getting all up in my personal space. 

“HOW DARE YOU KICK US OUT OF YOUR RESTAURANT!! I HAVE TWO KIDS, DOES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?! IS THIS WHAT CHRISTMAS IS FOR YOU??!?!” 

(I love that he thought having kids would somehow excuse him from being treated like everyone else??)

The guy at the counter was smiling and polite throughout this manbaby’s tantrum of not getting his way, which quite possibly enraged giant manbaby even more. 

While it was hilarious to see a grown ass man absolutely flip his shit over being asked to move to a different table (nowhere was it said that they were asked to leave, but of course in manbaby language that meant GTFO, somehow), I felt bad for the servers who had to deal with him. The guy at the counter brushed it off, but the other server who presumably had to deal with manbaby’s tantie at the table looked like she was beyond done with his shit, and in fact, told him that he was being disrespectful and that if he wasn’t happy, he should leave. 

This set manbaby off on another tirade! All the while his wife was trying to get him to leave while ALSO interjecting with how horrible they were being and how they should do their jobs. Of course, everyone should just drop what they’re doing and make the other customers leave so they can serve you and your stupid spoilt family alone!

The kicker was, after making an enormous scene and storming out while yelling about how it was a horrible restaurant, manbaby actually came stomping back a minute later to scream:

“IS IT BECAUSE OF MY COLOUR?!”

BITCHHHH, HALF THE PATRONS IN THERE WERE BROWN AS WELL, YOU INSANELY ENTITLED TWAT. We all could see that he was totally grasping at straws trying to play the victim and it just got pathetic.

So following a 5 hour car drive after a business appointment I was understandably not too eager to cook dinner myself, so I chose to grab some artisanal bread produce from Subterrain Sandwiches in my hometown.

In line before me was an entity I had only heard of in legends, a perfect can-I-talk-to-the-manager-haircut-wielding mid 40s soccer mom. She seemed fine at first, somehow ordering her sandwiches without making a scene. However, when it came to toasting the bread she became rather rude in saying that ""you people never toast the bread well enough, so I want you to toast it twice as long as you normally would"". The subterrain-certified sandwich craftsman advised her against that, but she wouldn't hear any of it.

After what seemed like an eternity her charcoalesque sandwiches were retrieved from subterrain's hellish ovens. For some reason she seemed dissatisfied with the result and blamed the employee for mishandling her sandwiches, as if he had personally instructed the ovens to burn the bread. After the employee tried to defend himself she channeled all of her might to perform her ultimate ability, calling for a manager. The manager promptly arrived and was filled in on what happened.

Thankfully we're not in the US where retail employees are meant to just take any abuse with a smile and managers (at least in my experience) fuck over their employees to keep the customer happy so he told her exactly the same things the wheat wizard did.

She demanded a do-over, to which the manager said he would be happy to oblige if she paid for the current sandwiches which were burnt because of her personal wishes. She didn't like that one bit and started a screaming match, but was ultimately overpowered.

Since, again, we're not in the US where apparently people just knock things over whilst loudly leaving and it's seen as normal she meekly paid for her charcoal and left the room and I was able to order my sandwiches, not missing the opportunity to kindly ask the employee to toast the sandwiches to a reasonable degree based on his personal recommendation, we got a good laugh out of that.

Be kind to retail workers. Also, believe them when they say that your demand for a twice-toasted sandwich is **retarded**.

Edit: I have been told that my usage of the word retarded was doubleplusungood and am personally responsible for every instance of bullying of a child with a learning disability because of it, therefore, for your viewing pleasure, I have emboldened the offending word so you can avoid it more easily.

Her parents recommended a high-end Italian place, having had great food and a good experience there. So, our heads held high, gf and I decided to go ourselves.

So we walk in, and one of the first things I notice is the people. I hold the door for an older-looking couple, and upon entering, find that nearly all the other customers are old people. That’s fine, I don’t mind old people. My gf and I just felt a little out of place. The man who seated us was a little condescending, but we didn’t really mind, he only seated us. He wasn’t our waiter.

Our waitress was the first other young person we saw in that restaurant. She took our orders for drinks, and my girlfriend and I were left to discuss... whatever it is that teenagers normally discuss. But that was when we noticed it: we seemed to be sitting near a table where the manager of the restaurant and her husband were seated. This is not an issue, again, yet I hold managers to the same standard of politeness as their employees.

Their waitress comes in and the manager begins... recording her? That seemed strange to me, I would be pretty nervous if the manager of the restaurant recorded me on the job. The waitress, almost perfectly, recites the daily specials to the manager. But the manager, unimpressed, tells her she wasn’t making good eye contact. That’s understandable, she looks like a new hire and is obviously nervous. Practice makes perfect, and she was almost there. But here was her mistake. She dares TELL the manager she is nervous, amid a flurry of apologies. This sets the manager off. Almost yelling, manager says, “How the h**l are you going to be able to serve a customer if you’re too nervous to serve me?” She dismisses the waitress, but leaves my gf and me dumbstruck. She made a small mistake, and you yelled at her in front of customers? Really inviting atmosphere.

Our drinks come out, a group of old people is seated near us. The manager and her husband get a new, older, more experienced waitress. She also skillfully recites the daily specials, while making good eye contact with the manager. The manager, this time, compliments her waitress. But remember how she was recording her old waitress? She showed her new waitress the video, loudly announcing, “She’s looking at the f**king ceiling!” to almost the entire room. The group of older people doesn’t seem to care, as they are discussing judge Kavenaugh’s confirmation (this is around that time). But at this point my gf and I are downright scared. Furthermore, the manager explains, “She got hired because she was a foreigner with a pretty face.” Ouch. She did a really good job remembering the specials, so I had no clue what the manager was on about. But we live in the United States, and in an area which is almost completely white. But I’m especially hurt knowing the manager of this restaurant is kind of a racist. Most people, when they look at me, peg me as Egyptian or Indian. It is relevant to say, I suppose, that anyone could tell I’m not white. So this comment really stung me.

My gf and I get the food we ordered, which was actually very exceptional. But having good food and a nice waitress was beginning to be overshadowed by the loud, rude, racist manager sitting near us. But we sit there, we eat our food, we try to enjoy ourselves. Then came the straw that broke the camel’s back. The manager starts with a new conversation topic. “Have you seen these girls’ homecoming dresses? They might as well be going out naked.” Like I said before, we were the only young people in the restaurant. And my girlfriend is definitely the only person wearing a homecoming dress. So she takes this extremely personally. The manager continues, “I’m so glad I only have sons. If I had a daughter and she tried to go out in that...” Her husband, who has agreed with her up to this point, starts telling her to calm down, probably because at this point, he notices that my girlfriend is crying and his wife does not seem to care one bit.

I’m furious at this point, so I “go to the bathroom” and call gf’s mom and ask for advice, and she tells us to get ready to leave and confront the manager. By the time I’m out of the bathroom, though, the manager and her husband are gone. So we asked the waitress to bring us the check and some boxes, expressing our sympathies for the actions of their manager towards her employees. She tells us “no worries, this kind of thing happens all the time.” So we go to my gf’s house, finish eating, and end up calling the restaurant. I confronted the manager about what she said loudly enough for the whole room to hear, but she gave a halfhearted apology and chocked it up to “we’re kids who don’t know what we heard.” Gf and I went to homecoming, though, and had an otherwise great day.

I loved the food and the wait staff at this restaurant. But this experience absolutely ruined it for us. We are NEVER, under any circumstance, going back there.",1,Bad management can ruin an otherwise great eating experience,176

One hotel who I have a great history with just ruined the trip. The hotel that prides itself on having all suites did not provide me with a room I’d call a suite. There was no tub, no hot water, and room service could not provide a bucket to chill my wine stating all theirs were dirty. I’ve stayed at a lot of these branded hotels beds this was about the same as any motel I’ve been in and I’m paying luxury prices.

The front desk said the stay was booked through xxx website and therefore they had to provide the receipt. I didn’t think much of it until I arrived back home.


I call the travel agent to get the receipt and do my expense report. They call the hotel and the hotel emails me a receipt for my incidentals which I already have. I called the customer service number on the email and ultimately the loyalty program which I have been a loyal member of for ages. No one would provide me a receipt. I had made probably a dozen calls over a week and a half. I was also irritated because I was quoted $199 for the stay and they charged $340. The credit card showed the hotel charged it and not the booking website. I finally get fed up and a friend suggested disputing the charge. I called the hotel one last time and threaten to dispute the charge, and within minutes this hotel had emailed me a receipt. Really? It was as easy for one person, but not all the others?

We were there because of a Facebook promotion promising branded coffee mugs if you were one of the first 100 or whatever customers. 

From the start, our server was very inconsistent on the policy and it got confusing. She said we could only get the branded mug if we ordered a beer from their specialty beer menu. I rechecked both Facebook posts and neither said anything about this rule. Meanwhile, the manager came round with a box full of mugs and was giving them out to everyone, regardless of beverage. When the server came back, I ordered my go-to beer, which wasn’t on the specialty menu. She was like, “I told you you have to order from the other menu,” and I responded with the Facebook post and the fact that I already had a mug. She was all, “well I’m not going to take your mug away from you, but you’re not allowed to do what you’re doing.” So I took back my order and ordered something off the specialty menu. It was fine, I’m glad I branched out, but I was still annoyed at the way it went down.

I few minutes later I noticed a poster for a beer called “CBS” by a local brewery, who also makes a beer called “KBS.” The CBS is very limited and hard to find, but the KBS is very common. So I pointed to the poster of CBS, which was dated two days prior, and asked if we could get a sample. We said out loud three times all the letters that make up the beer, plus pointing to the poster. She brings the sample and we’re like, “meh” so we didn’t order a full glass. 

I little while later we’re perusing the menu and we see a mead that sounds interesting from a local meadery. I don’t know if that’s a word; spellcheck doesn’t like it lol. Anyway, we ask for a sample of it and she said, “actually I got in trouble for giving you that other sample and I can’t do it anymore.” I responded along the lines of “I would expect to pay a buck or two, but I’m not going to order a full glass unless I know if I like it, but whatever, ok.”

Mind you, we are ordering meals and beers (that we know we like) and I also ordered a Bloody Mary, so it’s not like we were just trying to get free samples.

When it’s time for the check to come, I see that we were charged for a sample... of the beer that we did not order. I posted it out to the server, like, you charged us for this sample, which would be fine, except I asked for the CBS, not the KBS. She was like, “no, I’m sure you said KBS. “Um, no, I pointed right at that poster, remember?” “No, sorry.”

At the end of them telling me they wouldn’t help me specifically, the call center person said “Is there anything else I can help you with today?”

I know they were likely reading from a script and had to say that as a part of their job, but it made me laugh that they basically said “We can’t do anything for you, but is there anything else we can not help you with?”

This seemed reasonable so we got the code and drove out there.

When I walked in to the cabin all of the lights were off except for the bathroom...I could see light under the crack in the door. I assumed the cleaning crew just left the lights on in there. Then I got closer and heard someone was clearly on the toilet. To my surprise, my immediate reaction wasn’t fear or surprise or even just a general “wtf”...I was just trying to figure out how to handle the situation. Do I knock on the door? Do I say something loudly from the living room? Do I wait for him to finish and walk out on his own? This was certainly a first for me...

I decided to turn on all of the lights, get a good sense of the floor plan and layout, and see if anyone else was in the cabin. It appeared that everything in the rooms was untouched and it was just the one guy in the bathroom, so I just got prepared to confront him when he got out. I wasn’t expecting a physical altercation but I made sure I knew where anything was that I could trip on, anything that could be used as a weapon, etc. In hind sight, I probably should have just left the cabin and called the front desk and/or the police, but it didn’t seem necessary in the moment.

The mystery pooper (or “MP” for short) walked out of the bathroom and was pretty shocked to see me standing there. 

“Who are you and how did you get in here?” I said, firmly. 

MP: “Uh...um...I thought this was our unit. Sorry...”

Me: “This is not your unit. Again, how did you get in here?”

MP: “Uh...”

Me: “What is the code to the door?”

MP: “XXXX”

Me: “How did you get that code?”

MP: “The guy at the front desk gave it to me.”

Me: “Why did he give you the code to my cabin, and if you thought this was your unit, where’s all of your stuff?”

MP: “Uh...umm...”

Me: “OK, I don’t even care at this point. You need to leave, now. Do not come back in this cabin again or I will call the police.”

MP: “Ohhh oh ohkay, sorry.”

I then watched him leave my cabin, walk 30 feet away and walk straight in to the cabin next door where a group of 3 of his friends were drinking and playing beer pong.  “Oooookay then...time to call management” I thought to myself. 

I found the 24/7 support number on the fridge and called. The person who answered had no clue where I was staying and didn’t recognize the name of the cabin I was staying in. Clearly the 24/7 support was outsourced to another company unrelated to the group that owns the 20 or so cabins. After much back and forth, she figured it out and connected me with the person responsible for the cabins.

Me: “I just arrived at cabin #X and a strange man was using my bathroom.”

Manager: “What?”

Me: “I’m in cabin #X and a stranger was just in my bathroom. He said you gave him the code to my cabin.”

Manager: “Oh, that must have been the guys next door. There was a mixup earlier and I gave them your cabin number and code...but we moved them to the correct cabin. It’s all good now.”

Me: “You gave them my code and then didn’t change it? You need to come change the code immediately, that is completely unacceptable.”

Manager: “I mean we told them that wasn’t their cabin, they shouldn’t have gone in there. Maybe they thought it was vacant since you arrived so late.”

Me: “So how do I lock my door if these guys can just come unlock it at any time with the code? That is a huge safety concern.”

Manager: “Well now that they know you’re there I doubt they’d come back.”

Me: “Are you \*\*\*\*ing serious right now? You need to come change this code.”

Manager: “There’s nothing I can do tonight, I can have the manager call you in the morning.”

Me: “So you’re not the manager?”

Fake Manager: “No.”

Me: “This needs to be rectified first thing in the morning. I don’t have a choice, it’s freezing outside and my son needs to sleep so we’re going to stay here tonight. But this is completely unacceptable.”

Fake Manager: “I’m sorry. The manager will call you in the morning. I will also call the guests next door and make sure they understand not to come back.”

—

I brought our stuff in from the car and got everyone settled.  To make things extra fun, the entire cabin smelled like \*\*\*\*, so I went in to the bathroom to find that the fan was broken. Opening the window and letting in 30 degree air was also not an option. Awesome.

We went to bed and I’m happy to report that our neighbors didn’t come back and steal anything or murder my family. In fact, my son slept amazingly well. Yay!

The next morning the real manager called me and asked how I was doing. I told him we were OK but that he needed to come change the code and rectify the situation.  He then asked if he had to come right away or if he could come change the code in the early afternoon. I was in disbelief. He then followed up saying “I doubt they’re going to come back, we already spoke with them. Are you in the cabin now or do you have valuables you left in there?”

WTF? I told him that I was out eating breakfast with my family and that he needed to get to the cabin ASAP and change the code as it was a major privacy and safety concern. He reluctantly agreed.  Then we started to discuss how he would make things right.

Manager: “I can offer you a free night on a future stay for the inconvenience. When would you like to come back?”

He was on speaker phone and my wife and I looked at each other like “is this guy \*\*\*\*ing serious right now?”

Me: ""No, thanks. I'm going to need a refund for last night, not a credit for a future stay.""

Manager: ""OK, let me see...I can refund you $XX.XX for Thursday night. Is that OK?""

Me: ""No, that's not even close to the full amount we paid for Thursday night. Are you not including Thursday's portion (half) of the cleaning fee? That cleaning fee is more than Thursday's rate by itself.""

Manager: ""Well the cleaning fee isn't per night, it's for the entire stay.""

Me: ""If I'm paying a cleaning fee, I'd expect that my room would be clean when I check in.  Instead, I checked in to a room where someone pooped in my bathroom, used my soap and towels, and smelled up my entire cabin. By the way, did I mention the bathroom fan doesn't work?""

Manager: ""I see. I can refund you half of the cleaning fee. In total the refund would be $XXX.XX.”

Me: ""OK, I booked through Expedia. Are you going to refund them and they'll refund me, or how does that work?""

Manager: ""Oh, no. Refunding through Expedia is way too complicated and would take hours.  We will just refund you directly. Do you have a PayPal account?""

Me: ""Yes.""

Manager: ""OK, if I send you PayPal can you promise to write us a good review on Expedia?""

Me: ""I can write an honest review on Expedia and say that you eventually took care of things properly and provided me with an appropriate refund.""

Manager: ""OK, umm...how about you don't waste your time and I send you the refund if you agree to just not write a review on Expedia at all?""

I look at my wife and we're both thinking ""WTF?"" and not sure if we should laugh or not.

Me: ""OK, that's fine.""

Manager: ""Alright, I'll send you a text asking you to agree not to post a review. Please reply with your PayPal and state 'I agree' in the text. I'll send the refund immediately.""

Me: ""OK. Bye.""

—

He then proceeded to send the text (which I screenshotted) and it reads:

""Hello.

It is good to talk to you today.

If you agree to NOT write any review on Expedia, I will refund you $XXX via PayPal.

Please reply agree and your PayPal email.

Thanks a lot

&lt;name of manager&gt;
&lt;address&gt;""

I replied to the text and he sent me the money. I just wanted to make sure we'd get something. While I doubt the text message is legally binding (and maybe it is, since a transaction was paired with it) I only agreed not to post on Expedia. He said nothing about every other travel site, reddit, or social media.

I'm not sure if I should try to post (a much shorter version of) this on the various travel sites to warn potential future guests. Anyway, at the very least, it seemed like an appropriate story for this sub.

Edit: According to legaladvice, the text message is legally binding and posting on other travel sites  or having someone else post it would be acting in bad faith. The plot thickens...anyway, I’ll update the post once we figure out what we’re doing. 

Edit #2: I am going to contact Expedia privately and let them know about what happened, including the fact that this hotel is paying people to write positive reviews (they tried to get me to do it). What they do with the information is up to them, but it’s the least I can do.

There are some really bizarre comments from people saying I’m vindictive, irate, I need to take it easy, etc. No one is mad here, I’m not trying to ruin this business or anything of the sort. I just want to them to have a better (any?) security policy and, if necessary, get different hardware that doesn’t require a person to come out and physically reprogram the lock on the door every single time a new guest arrives. That is just asking for human error, which is what happened to us and will happen again. If I can nudge them in the right direction, great.",1,"I entered my hotel room at 10pm and found a stranger pooping in my bathroom...after a very awkward confrontation (who are you and wtf are you doing in my bathroom?!), he left and I complained to management.

Brought the three-year-old, even though we'd told my mother-in-law that we were leaving him home to keep an eye on the dog, because for some inane reason she asked if we were bringing him, but that's neither here nor there.

Got a parking spot, no wait to be sat.  Seems like it should be an easy dinner.  Host brought a kid's menu and crayons, but didn't offer a booster or high chair.  Hrmph.  I check the nearby storage cubby and grab one.

Waited a few minutes, waiter walked by and said ""Hi, I'm not your waiter, but if you know what you'd like to drink, I'll be happy to get it for you!""  Sweet, man, sure.  Water, Coke, kids water.  Thanks.

Waited a bit longer, waitress rushed up apologetically, saying she was taking an order for a large party towards the front of the restaurant (and if the table behind us was hers too, she'd been double-sat).  No worries.  We've been here and know exactly what we want, we're pretty easy.  Two-for-$XX, this app, two fajita entrees, that dessert, kid will share with us as he had a lot of snacks before we left the house.

She brought our app promptly.  Awesome.  Kid eats, enjoys, plays on his tablet.  Table behind us, which had been sat after us... gets their food?  OK, sure, maybe their entrees were easier to prepare.  Smells pretty good.  Kid's still doing ok with his tablet, no worries.  Waitress keeps us topped off on refills.

She stops by and says our order should be out in a few minutes.  Sweet!

She stops by and says our order is just about ready.  It's kind of been a while, but... ok, sure thing.

She stops by and says the manager saw our food before it went out, decided it looked awful, and wanted to have it remade.  I mean, ok, sure, quality control is important.  She says he will be out to speak with us.

She stops by and says they're cooking our food now.

She stops by and says they're just about to start cooking our food (?) and the manager is going to come speak to us about our bill.  At this point, we begin to doubt the process.  She speeds on to get to her large party.

On her way back, we say, ok, we've been here for an hour (arrived at 6:35pm), kid's 8pm bedtime is approaching, can we just get our food to go?  She says yes.  She's nothing but apologetic, has continued to be lovely and attentive the whole time.  I worked in a restaurant in college, I know the entire situation's out of her hands.

Five minutes pass.  The food arrives, via a runner.  Husband and I exchange the briefest half-hearted chuckle and ask for it to be boxed to go, we can put it in the oven to keep it warm while we bathe and bed the kid, just let us get out of here, preferably with the food.  Husband hands me his wallet, grabs the restless toddler, and takes him to the car.

Ten minutes pass.  Another server sees me looking rather frustrated and asks if there's anything he can do to help.  I worked retail and restaurant for years in high school and college, but I'm starting to crack, y'all, I'm hungry and I'm sure the toddler is giving my husband quite the time in the car.  I tell him our food was supposed to be in to-go boxes fifteen minutes ago, we just want to go home, can we please get our check, this is getting ridiculous, just let us go home.  (Full disclosure: I did not expect a bill, though I was fully prepared to pay for the app and soda.)

Waitress comes out with a bag of food, looking totally contrite.  It's not her fault.  I know this, she knows this.  She says there's no bill.  I've already calculated an appropriate tip for the full price of our meals, and hand it to her.  She pushes back out of obligation, I insist she did just as much work as she would have done if she'd been able to bring the food, she takes the money.

We get home, divide and conquer.  I put food onto oven-resistant plates, husband bathes child, his turn for bedtime, I bring plates to table when I hear him coming.  And we discover why the manager wouldn't serve the fajitas:  Apparently, the kitchen couldn't cook fajitas to save their lives.  The chicken is fine, perhaps a little overdone but edible (and at 8:30pm, after two hours, we will settle for edible).  The vegetables are... charred.  And I don't mean ""charred around the edges"", I mean ""an entire side of these vegetables is black"".  Even the rice... the rice looks like they put it on the grill and burned it.  How do you mistreat RICE that poorly?  I mean really.  It's rice.",1,Apparently it is very difficult to make fajitas...,98

The only place in this midwestern town that serves food this late is the local gas station. BF opens the gas station’s app on his phone and sees the “buy one large pizza, get a free order of breadsticks deal.” Heck yes. The deal appears in his cart and he chooses to pay the $13 in store. Fast forward to pizza pickup time. He parks a couple spots over from a white minivan. All of the doors of the minivan are wide open and pot smoke is ROLLING out. Not legal here yet, but whatevs. As he goes in the passenger in the van follows him in. Turns out she’s the cashier. He picks up his pizza in the counter and grabs a soda on the way to check out. His total comes to $22. He asks if the breadsticks rang up free. 

Cashier: Uh, no. Why would they be free?

BF: On my app it says there’s an in-store deal where you get free breadsticks with purchase of a large pizza. *pulls out phone and shows her*

C: Well did you bring the coupon?

BF: No. It says in the app it’s just a sale. 

C: You should’ve brought you coupon with you. I can’t help you. 

BF: There is no coupon. It’s a SALE. 

C: Well. I guess we’ll just have to figure it out huh?

BF: I guess you will. 

Cashier rolls her eyes and types on her register until “-3.79” appears on the pin pad. 

C: Are you happy now? 

Boyfriend doesn’t even answer. He hands her $20 to cover the total. His change is something like $3.85. She hands him $3 and closes her drawer. 

C: We did drawers earlier and now there’s no change in my drawer. I gave you most of it. 

BF: Are you serious? I’m not leaving until I get my change. 

Cashier rolls her eyes and squats down below her register, presumable getting into the safe. She emerges with correct change a few seconds later. 

C: Are you happy now?

She set aside the item for me but when I got there, I realized that I needed two of them. I was having a hard time locating them in the store and everyone I asked immediately dropped everything and helped me!

 After a few minutes of looking, the lady who answered the phone came out with two more of the item. She said she found ones that were cuter than the first one she found, and she'd grabbed them just for me. 

My amazing experience ended with the lady at the counter triple wrapping the items so my son in the car wouldn't see what I'd purchased.

The nurse was staring me right in the eyes the whole time she asked me questions and was very fidgety. She didn't even take her eyes off my eyes to write my answers down. She couldn't hear anything I said to her even though I was speaking very clearly and as loud as I could. She kept picking up her phone and putting it down. Also, she kept insisting a freckle was a needle mark on my arm. I corrected her several times, but she kept insisting. I said firmly that it was a freckle. And then she took it back, saying if I was a user my arm would be all crazy looking etc. She also sat in a chair close to me with her legs spread and physically dragged me with the chair I was sitting in to in between her legs to draw blood and to check my blood pressure.

It made me very uncomfortable to the point I was sweating bullets. Especially considering I was alone with her in my office. I really wish they had used a less high strung and less deaf nurse.

911,[deleted],0,t3_a8qa1p,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a8qa1p/charged_for_car_insurance_then_told_i_hadnt_paid/,"Long time lurker here, and I just remembered a story I have from a few months ago! So I get my car insurance through a company that shall not be named. I get a really good price because it's bundled with my parents' cars (though I pay my insurance myself). One month for some reason, I decided to pay for the upcoming month and the month in advance, so I sent a check to the address listed on the paper bill (which I had been doing for over a year, and was far away in Florida) for twice the monthly amount. Then a few weeks later, my mom (who is the main account holder) got a call that my insurance wasn't paid, and my service was being cancelled. Confused, I checked my bank account, and they had indeed taken the money out of my account for the full amount I wrote on the check. I called the office to figure out what was going on, because I should have been covered for TWO MONTHS. The woman I talked to was so. damn. rude. I don't remember exactly, but it went something like this.

Me: Hello, I think there was a mistake with my bill. My mom got a call that I hadn't paid, but a few weeks ago I paid for two months of insurance

Lady: Nope we don't have a record of it. It'll be $xx.xx if you want to keep your insurance.

Me: No you see, the money has already been taken out of my account. I've already paid for two months.

Lady: It says here you didn't. It'll be $xx.xx.

Me: I'm not going to double pay for insurance.

And we went back and forth like that for a while.

I'd like to clarify that I am always extremely polite with customer service people, but she basically refused to do anything to help me or take me seriously AT. ALL. I get that maybe you get calls from people who are trying to scam you, but seriously? She wouldn't even consider that it was a possibility. I hung up and talked to my bank, and they faxed over a confirmation that the check had been cashed by said insurance company, so I called back and told them that.

Me: My bank has sent over confirmation of the check being cashed by ""Insurance company name""

Lady: I can see that here, but unfortunately we need a scanned copy of the physical check.

Me: Well, the bank told me that the billing place didn't scan the physical check. They typed the numbers into a computer, so there isn't a scanned copy.

Lady: I'm sorry there's nothing I can do for you.

At this point I was furious. I can't remember exactly how the rest of the interaction went, but she EVENTUALLY decided to let me have the two months of insurance that I paid for. She then started saying that they would do this for me as a courtesy, but it was actually my fault because I shouldn't have sent the check to that address in Florida (the one that was listed on my bill as the mailing address), but I should have mailed it to the local office instead. She also said that the account number I wrote on the check is not the correct one (the one that I had been putting on my checks for a year with no issues), which just sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.

I would switch insurance companies if I wasn't getting such a bargain, but I switched to online payments after that debacle.

This happened a year or two ago, so it isn’t verbatim. 

I’m with my husband and a couple friends. It’s late at night and we decide to go to a popular taco fast food chain that rhymes with BacoTell. We pull up to the drive through (the dining room is closed as it’s late) and place our orders, all is fine. We pay for our orders and the guy at the window tells us it’ll be a couple minutes. No problem, it’s late so they’re making everything from scratch or whatever I assume. We don’t care, we just want some dang tacos. 

A few minutes go past....nothing. A different employee, who I recognized as an old friends little brother, comes to the window. I will be Me and the employee will be known as Stoney (he was obviously very stoned). 

Stoney: Hey, we’re out of ground beef and it will be 30 minutes before we can have more made. 

Me: ??? Uh okay, I guess chicken is fine? 

Stoney: So you want everything replaced with chicken? 

Me: Yes, please. 

Weird af but okay. Keep in mind it is dead, we are the only people in the drive through. It’s late, but not even close to closing time. Whatever, we’ve already paid and just want some tacos. 

A few more minutes go by and Stoney reappears at the window. 

Stoney: So what did you want to substitute the beef with?

Me: .....chicken? 

Stoney: Oh that’s right! It’ll be right out for you guys! 

At this point we’re thinking we’re in some sort of weird alternate reality. Why is BacoTell out of beef? How does it take 30 minutes to make ground beef? Why have I been in this drive through for 15 minutes and still no tacos?? Am i speaking a different language? So many questions. 

But we shrug and just wait it out. 

It has now been at least 30 minutes since we placed our order. We’re hungry and annoyed, but mostly hungry. Stoney reappears at last with our food, thanks us, we thank him and start to leave. At this point we just want to eat. I pull the food out and start making sure everything was there because...well obvious reasons. I open my food and lo and be-fucking-hold, it’s beef! Not one single item was chicken, it was all beef. I guess Stoney decided it was better we wait the 30 minutes for beef and that it was cool to not tell us. I ended up messaging the old friend to tell him this story and he confirms that it was his brother and that he was definitely high as a kite. He got a kick out of it.

913,01001011komeil,0,t3_a8u9wd,3,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a8u9wd/technical_issue_halting_replacement_and_refund/,"TL;DR: The biggest search and ad company is facing widespread technical issues in placing replacement and refund orders and at the same time does not extend Customer Care services such as complaint procedures like other regions of the world to UK customers where it operates. They have confirmed in an email the technical issue to me and the halt of replacements being shipped. It's been carrying on at least a week and the backlog is building.

I preordered 3 devices from their UK website on 09 October 2018.

The devices were delivered on 05 November and unfortunately, one had 3 defects;

I communicated the problems to their Support on 25 November 2018 who took a few days to agree a replacement was warranted.

After a few days, a replacement arrived on 30 November 2018 but it was the wrong device. I contacted support again and was told to hold on to the devices, both defective and wrong replacement, while a new replacement was issued.

Following no news, I chased with Support to be told I was given the wrong information and I had to send back the wrong replacement and was assured as soon as the device is marked as shipped the new replacement would be sent out. I shipped the device the following day on 12 December 2018.

Again in contacting Support, I was told I had been misinformed and I had to wait for the wrong replacement device to be delivered to their warehouse and then a replacement would be sent out immediately.

The delivery was made on the 14 December 2018 but on chasing again I was told I have been misinformed and I have to wait until their shipping department checks, OKs, and marks the device as delivered. This took until 18 December 2018 which I had to force by refusing to hang-up untill it was sorted.

On18 December I was told they are experiencing technical difficulties processing refunds and replacements [not just me for everyone] while sales continue to work fine. This is still in effect today 23rd December.

Being frustrated and still left with a defective device I requested to know of their Customer Service complaint process and was told Support does not provide UK costumers with a complaint process. I was also told there is no timeline regarding the technical issue and I have no option other than wait and I cannot complain.

So a little background: I’ve briefly worked in fast/quick food service, I know what goes on nearing closing time once the manager leaves. I don’t smoke weed personally, but never had an issue with people doing it around me, I’m totally cool with it.

What I’m not cool with is when it effects how you do your job.

I was at a very popular burrito/taco chain the other night getting dinner at about 45 minutes before closing time. Since it was late and slow, there were two people working the front line; one burrito maker and a cashier.

When I order the first part of my burrito, the guy is just grinning ear to ear. Looking at me, then looking around, and bouncing up and down to the music. “Okay, he’s high. Whatever”, I thought to myself. For the most part he gets the rice, beans, and meat order correctly, but it was a lot slower than usual and filled up a lot of the burrito already. Oh well, it’s cool.

Now is when things start to go downhill. I tell him the salsa I want and he just started blankly at me. Still smiling, still bouncing up and down, so I tell him again. He puts one huge flop of salsa down, looks at it, looks and me, and chuckles. *okay whatever* I give him the rest of my order, he repeats in back wrong, so I do it again, and he gets it wrong again. Finally I just tell him what I want one by one.

Now quick side note: I’m not allergic to dairy, or even hyper sensitive to it. But too much dairy gives me a pretty bad stomach ache on top of other stomach issues I already have.

So by this time it’s already taken twice as long as it should to make this thing, and I say “just a little bit of sour cream please.” He pauses, looks at the burrito, and the sour cream, and puts another huge spoonful right on top. *god damn it* oh well, you can’t really put sour cream back so I try to make up for it and say “and a VERY small amount of cheese.”

Now the cashier is beginning to ring up my order, and out of the corner of my eye I see him take a massive handful of cheese and put it on, still smiling and giggling, still bouncing to the music.

“That’s way too much, take some off please” I tell him. So he takes some off. I tell him the last thing I want is guacamole and he takes a big spoonful and puts it right on top again. That’s cool, I like guacamole. So I’m all rung up at this point just waiting for this guy to finish, and he tries to wrap it. Too big, fail. Tries again, too big fail. Gets a different Tortilla. Too big, fail. 

This might take a while so I go to fill up my drink. As I come back the guy is trying to wrap this up and is trying to stop the over flow with HANDFULS of cheese while he’s wrapping it, with a look on his face that said “I know what can stop this! More cheese!”

I just stand in awe. He’s laughing trying to get this thing together. Finally it’s all a combined mess from switching tortillas. The wrap breaks, but he wraps it up anyway, before I have a chance to say anything.

I booked a hotel room using an online service that specializes this using my card and a friend’s name. We got to the hotel and he gave them his credit card. A couple of days ago I realized that my card was also charged. Contacted this online company and they called the hotel to find out what happened. Hotel confirmed a second card paid for the room. However, this online service will not refund me my money because I didn’t let them know. All monies paid to this company go to the hotel, so I don’t understand why I can’t get my money refunded. Hotel was paid twice. I let them know I would be contacting my issuing back and they told me do what you have to do.

917,AlphaEp1,0,t3_a8qg94,6,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a8qg94/potential_bank_fraud_sorry_were_closed/,"Today I recieved an email from my banking institution.

No big deal. I get these all the time. Only today was different. The email claims I attempted to send $50 to my mother via a ""bank based money transferring app"" that my particular institution uses to transfer funds.

Collectively my wife and myself began to freak out. I've never sent my family money via my bank account, nor do I know anything of this app.

Upon some googling I found this particular app has tons of fraud problems. The first 5 results are news stories regarding exactly this. 

So what does any person suspecting fraud do? Well you contact the bank right? Apparently not!

In the past I've had issues with some banks around my area. After a little research we found this institution and signed up. Now the only problem is, their customer service phone line goes through their actual branch locations for a more ""personalized"" experience. Traditionally when a branch is closed, you're sent to a call center. This bank usually has one operating here in the States, but when that's closed the calls usually go overseas. 

It's not ideal, but sometimes it works. Well after getting this email, my first thought was maybe it was my mother. I contacted her and the account number in the email is correct of hers, as it's correct of mine (last 4 at least). 

Next I called the number on the back of my card. It tries to transfer me to my local branch. As everyone knows it's the weekend before Christmas, and of course all my local branches are closed. An automated message says the US call center in addition to all branches will be closed from the 24th to the 26th.

Alright. Cool. I'm not against that. But today is the 22nd? I proceeded to call EVERY SINGLE NUMBER on my banks website, including the fraud department, and they all have this same message, where at the end it hangs up on you with the oh so wonderful robotic ""Goodbye.""

While looking through my account, I was able to verify this app does have a partnership with my bank. I clicked a little ""More Information"" tab near the bottom of the site regarding the app. Page never loaded. Thought nothing of it and closed it.

Next thing I know I get an email from the bank again saying ""Thank you for signing up for 'App'!""

This is about the point I called every number on my banks website, again, and was met with the same thing over and over. Now the only way to contact them is to send an email via a ""secure inbox"" on my banks site. Only problem is the auto reply is the same message as on the phone. 

I double and even triple checked the website. Didn't click on anything in either of the emails. Googled my banks site to find the real one (just in case it was phishing) and this is what I'm left with. 

I absolutely understand it's near the holidays and everyone needs a break. I absolutely understand wanting to base your customer services offices locally to make things more personal. I do NOT understand why when there's a potential issue that I can't contact anyone, period.

Now I have to let my account sit until after Christmas to even make sure nothing's wrong. I hope it's just the bank messing something up, but from what I've read this is what usually happens before this ""app"" clears people's accounts. Regardless I'd rather be safe than sorry.

I don't want to be a dick about this, but I'm sure as you all understand, you don't fuck with people's money. Guess we'll figure it out next week! 

Happy holidays to us, I guess!

Edit 1: I recieved a reply email. They thanked me for banking with them and my message will be read by a rep in the next few days. Bank was closed early today and as such was unable to call anyone before I had to go to work. 

Will hopefully edit soon.",1,Potential bank fraud? Sorry we're closed.,20
918,nootdoot,0,t3_a8fhz0,171,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a8fhz0/i_tipped_everyone_but_her/,"Long post-TLDR at bottom 


This happened some time last summer. My husband and I are 19 and 20. We are young and we look young but we tip well and act like adults (usually haha). We had just got home from our honeymoon but still had a few days before going back to work and wanted to have lunch at a place that we frequented regularly. We usually went there at night (24 hour diner) so we were more familiar with the night staff. 

This particular afternoon was pretty slow. It was a Tuesday around 3pm so there were only 2 servers working. We were one of 3 tables in the restaurant. The diner is set up like an open train car so there really isn't any place you cant see besides the kitchen. Everything is out in the open.


So we sit down and get our menu's. About 10 minutes go bye before our server shows up to ask for our drink orders. This is odd because again, its not busy. She was clearly in her late 40s and we had never seen her before. We told her our drinks and that we were ready to order as well. Her face immediately turned sour for some reason. She said she would get our drinks first and then come back for the orders. Okay? Odd but not super weird. She walked to the bathroom and didn't come back for 10 minutes. During this time another couple was sat behind us. Before she brought us our drinks or even took our order she greeted them(an older couple) and was the sweetest waitress you'd ever meet. She was incredibly nice to them. She eventually brought all of our drinks at the same time. When we finally gave her our order she looked at me with disdain and said 'what do you want?'. It was so blatantly rude, like we were a waste of her time. I ordered a meal and asked for the child's size because it's a more reasonable portion and the adult size is huge. I order the same meal every time I go in. Well she wasnt having it and very loudly said 'OH! We only do kids orders for CHILDREN! Are you under 12?' I was livid. What did I do to this woman to cause her reaction? I told her to bring me the regular sized order and a to-go box. She said she would make an exception and bring the kids size but it would be the adult price. NO LADY! I'm not paying the same price for less food! So she writes down both our orders very huffy and then goes to take the other tables order. I assume she put the orders in at the same time. 20 minutes later the other table (who ordered steaks) receives there food and we still have nothing. At this point we had been there for almost 40 minutes. We ordered a grilled cheese and pancakes. Clearly something didnt add up. We watched our server sit down and talk with the other table behind us for like 15 minutes while our food sat under the hot lamp. At that point I was done being nice and I walked  behind the counter to get our food. But we didn't have silverware. I tried to get her attention(she ignored me) 5 minutes later she walks by and says 'you need something?'. Yes. Silverware. She drops it off and says nothing. We eat and the table behind us eventually leaves. Now we have been here for well over a  hour. The server dropped the check without asking if we wanted dessert. She goes and sits in a booth adjacent and just stares at us waiting for us to walk up to the checkout. But we dont. We have all day.


20 minutes go by. My husband looks at her and she still doesn't come over to say anything. He even refilled his own coffee. At this point we can tell her shift is over because she's complaining loudly to a coworker that she just wants her tip so she can leave. Another girl (a server who we recognize) comes to tell us she will take over until we decide to leave and mentions that -other server- is cashing in to leave for the day (meaning she wants her tip). We told her that our server wasnt getting shit and that she can tell her that I said she can eat shit for the way she treats customers too. My husband says I was way too harsh but I was SUPER pissed. I then made sure to give $15 to the girl who just took over and said 'I know you'll take care of us'. Well as I mentioned before this place is an open set up and she totally heard/saw what I did. She said something to a coworker and then stormed out of the restaurant while giving us a nasty look. 

I don't know if she was being shitty to us because we were young or she thought we wouldn't tip anyway? I work in the service industry and usually tip 20%+. Or maybe she didnt like the way we look (yellow hair/stretched ears). The weirdest thing is that this place is right next to the college. So young people/students are there all the time. 


Anyways. I've never had a worse experience. I tipped the new server and the host/busser on my way out. I also called the manager(who we knew very well). The next time we went in there she was gone. Fired 2 days later. 

TLDR; Old bitchy server hates young people and calls me a child unprompted. Still expects a tip and storms out of the restaurant when she doesn't get one. ",1,I Tipped Everyone But Her,1760

Around 3:17  I ordered a pizza from [redacted], a medium cheese with pepperoni on one side and 2 cokes. I order it and go to waste some time. Around 4 I'm wondering what's taking so long, I haven't even got a notification that it's on its way. So I look at the app, it says it was done at about 3:30, so why isn't it on its way? I just assume their busy and go back to my work. Around 4:30 I get a notification it's on its way, dope. At 5 it's still not here, my house is about 15 minutes away from the store so it shouldn't take this long. I decide to call the store, they say they probably just had a lot of orders (how do you not know how busy your own store is?) and that traffic is probably bad (it was not). I just sigh and sit on the couch waiting. At 5, almost 2 hours after I ordered, the pizza gets here. The deliver guy isn't even polite. And to top it all off the pizza was cold.

Anyway, we were at our cabin thinking of something to do because we were pretty much in the middle of nowhere. We planned on going to the movies fairly early so we got ready and walked probably a half hour to the closest local theater. We saw Alpha which was a very brilliant movie I think. After the movie, we went out to the parking lot and to my delight there was a pizza place literally right next door. Never even noticed! Anyway, went inside, not a big place, people really eating sloppily. Just what you’d expect for a local pizza joint. We walk up to the counter to look at the menu and the toppings are ranging from 8-11 bucks each. I’m thinking to myself, wtf? Cuz who would pay 11 dollars for one topping? This older gentleman comes up to the counter and, with a deadpan look in his eye, he just mutters out, “Can I get you anything?” I say no, we’re still deciding (I like to take my time). As we’re looking, about thirty seconds in after all that, this other younger looking guy comes up to counter and jokes about the prices of the toppings being completely inaccurate. He laughs, I laugh, my brother laughs. He seems to really like his job. After this he says that he could make a pizza for us in about 15 minutes after he takes out the trash to which I reply I really like a lot of toppings (lol). We seem to have a pretty good vibe goin. So he goes outside. But for some reason, I guess I was really hungry, we gave our order to some older woman who is also deadpan. Kinda creepy if you ask me. Like yeah you might not like your job but at least perk up a little. She gets the order to the kitchen and we go sit down. As soon as we get our pizza, the same guy I was joking with walks by us with a “you motherfucker” kind of look. Now I’m thinking we made a mistake not waiting for the guy. When we finally pick up the pizza, everything including the sauce falls completely off. Yeah.... I was right. To add to the fact that everything fell off, everything tasted like greasy shit. I guess really should’ve waited. I wanted to apologize to the guy but he seemed to let it go and stay joyful. He was really cool honestly. He complimented my brothers t shirt which said “los pollos harmanos” in reference to breaking bad. I wish I could go back there and get a proper pizza from the guy.

I guess there’s also a moral to my story to. For those reading, here’s a tip. If you’re in a restaurant like this, look for the person who seems the most happy because it all ties in with how they make their food. Avoid anyone making the food who seems like they couldn’t give two shits about anything. You may not think it would, but it makes all the difference in the food that they make.",1,"I could’ve had my day saved, if only....",10
921,bain-of-my-existence,0,t3_a8hp49,20,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a8hp49/please_dont_kick_me_out/,"Background: I'm 21yo and recently married, which has resulted in me getting a shiny ""Adult"" horizontal Driver's License, which proves immediately that I am over 21. My friend (30yo, but can pass as 25) and I enter a new, upscale hotel bar known for its extensive list of cocktails. For context, while I am 21 (almost 22!) I am constantly being mistaken for a high schooler or just barely 18. 

&amp;#x200B;

We sit at the bar and we get carded right away. Bartender takes a long wile looking at mine before he eyes me and hands it back. Whatever, I get that every time I go out. We order our drinks, which are bright pink with a flower, totally instagram worthy. Now, I don't know why, but I really like reading menus or signs and seeing everything that's in my food or drink, and while doing so a group of men approach us after our second round. They recognize my friend, who doesn't seem all that happy to see him, so I just wave and don't introduce myself. I turn back to the menu, and start looking at the ingredients in the drinks (there's a lot).

&amp;#x200B;

The bartender suddenly springs up (totally startling buzzed-me) and starts going on about how I'm having an allergic reaction to the drink. I can barely understand what he and my friend start yelling, before I assure him, I'm simply reading the menu to see what's in it, not to check for any allergens. It struck me as a weird thing to suddenly scream at me, and wondered if he thought I wasn't really 21 (I am a bit of a lightweight) and was trying to get me to leave the bar. He says that I'f I don't feel good, that my friend should take me to urgent care or just take me home. I didn't want to panic, but I had never been kicked out before, and this guy had it out for me. The other guys all sauntered away, not wanting any of the drama, while the bartender got his coworker to look at me as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm freaking out, wondering what they're seeing that's making them so worried. The drinks had prickly pear syrup, and he kept asking if I was allergic to it (I'm not). Finally the other bartender comes over, looks at me, and tries his best not to laugh or shake his head. He asks if I'm hot (temperature wise), and offers to turn up the AC. That's when it all clicked; one of the reasons I never look my age is because I have pretty intense rosacea that flares up on my chest, shoulders, and my whole face, but since I am very tan, it tends to manifest as a very deep blushing or even a heat rash. I had been laughing and drinking, and of course was slowly turning more pink than tan as the night progressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend bust up laughing when she noticed it, and declared that I'm always blushing and I would be fine. The bartender, finally defeated, went back around the bar and continued to shoot me weird glances like I was some undercover agent. We picked up our tab and we tipped the guy, although even up until the time we left he kept noting that I really shouldn't drink something I'm unused to if it makes me break out in a heat rash. I wanted to assure him that it wasn't the alcohol, but my friend pulled me out and told me not to worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never once broken the law especially when it pertains to alcohol, but that guy made me feel like I was a criminal the whole night out. I really want to take some of my other friends there, but I'd hate to give that guy another reason to give me the boot.",1,Please Don't Kick Me Out,24

926,AlfieBilly,0,t3_a88t0a,10,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a88t0a/this_gym_membership_did_not_workout_well/,"I had an infuriating experience at my former gym. 

Before signing up there, I had an appointment where a trainer showed me the different areas and the equipment. That was literally all he did. I then signed up. 

I started coming in regularly and using the machines he showed me, but after a few months I  was interested in trying free weight exercises and functional training.

Since I did not know what exercises to do for the best results and how often to do them etc, I went up to the front desk and asked for an appointment to develop a training schedule with a trainer for me. (It specifically said in my contract and in their ads that one training schedule is included in the membership). 

They looked at me in a very baffled way and ask if I hadn't had an appointment with a trainer before signing up. I said that I did, but did not get a training schedule. They said something along the lines of ""That can't be right, you must have gotten one, everybody gets a schedule before signing up"". I repeated that I did not get one and did not know I was supposed to get one right away, and that the trainer just showed me around and then had me sign the contract. 

They asked me who the trainer was and then reluctantly agreed to arrange another appointment with me.

So the appointment comes up, and I arrive 10 mins early in order to warm up (since I expexted them to show me exercises and look what weights I can do). I warm up and go to the front desk to meet the trainer. Let's just call her Sarah for this. She tells me to sit in the lounge and wait. I wait for 10 minutes and I am kind of cold, but then she comes. We end up discussing my fitness level and what my goals are for 10 minutes. Sarah writes everything down, recommends me a few exercises, and then she tells me to go warm up again, and that she will get me in 5 minutes and we will go to the free weight area and she will show me how to do them correctly.

I am a bit annoyed, because I had already stated everything she asked when I made the appointment, and on that day I had already warmed up in order to save her some time because I expected to do the exercises right away, but fair enough. I go warm up and expect her to be back soon.

I am on the elliptical. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 13 minutes. She is not coming back. I go to the front desk and ask where she is. They tell me that she is not available  and that I should wait in the lounge, the other trainer (let's call her Karen) will be right there for me. Ok. I am annoyed, but fine. I go sit in the lounge. The other trainer is nowhere to be found. I ask the service girl where Karen is. She tells me to sit in the lounge and wait, Karen will come.

At this point I snap and say ""I will NOT sit down again and freeze my butt off, I have warmed up two times already, I want someone to exercise with me now."" She snaps back at me and says ""It's not our fault you warmed up before your appointment, you were bot supposed to do that"". Fine, but I did not know that. Nevermind. I sit down. She then miraculously finds Karen very quickly and sends her over. 

Turns out Karen knows NOTHING and asks me again for all the information I gave Sarah earlier. I tell her that I already told Sarah everything and what exercises Sarah recommended for me and that I would just like her to show them to me now. 

Karen has THE NERVE to tell me that I picked a bad time for that, because at this time of the day the free weight area is too packed. (I just took the appointment that was offered to me though). I insist, so she shows me 3-ish exercises, writes me a generic-ass schedule and I am on my way.

My boyfriend and I love to order from this local Italian/pizzeria place and sometimes have it delivered. So, I order online and include a $5 tip on an $18 order. It says it’ll be an hour to deliver, which is normal, and I go about my tasks at hand.

Almost two hours later, the delivery driver shows up and hands me my stuff. Then he says “can I get a tip?” So, I tell him that I included one online and he replies, very rudely, that I didn’t and he can show me the receipt where it’s not included. I hardly ever have cash on me, so I only had a dollar and I apologized and said that I was 100% sure I had included one before I checked out online.

He then preceded to get really mad and go on a rant about how many other customers tell him that, too and that their online system is wacky and then offered to show me how to order and include a tip. I declined and said I would figure it out next time. I told him maybe he should bring it up to his manager or the owner, as they are probably losing a lot of tips. He replied that he didn’t care that much because he preferred cash tips.


This coupled with the last delivery driver from there complaining about the three steps he had to walk down to get to my apartment, I told my boyfriend that if we were ordering from there again, we would pick it up.

I have a friend with Celiac disease. There is a very limited list of places (especially chains) that she trusts not to contaminate her food. I saw her for the first time in a while today, so we did and shopping and had dinner together. Thankfully I knew that there is a Mediterranean chain restaurant that she trusts in the same area we would be shopping in. We've eaten together at this chain before but in a different location.

We order our food and, all told, my meal, with refillable fountain drink was $18 or so. I was okay with this ONLY because I knew I'd have enough food to use the leftovers as dinner for my extra late evening shift tomorrow.

After we've eaten, we box up our leftovers, refill our drinks and stack our plates on the table, as it seems that is the preferred practice at the restaurant. We both have to use the restroom, so we gather our purses and leave our boxes and drinks on the table with the plates. I thought the fact that the food was in boxes would've been enough to show that it's something we want to keep, and we weren't in the restroom for more than 5 minutes.

Lo and behold, we return to our table and it's empty. We are visibly crestfallen. There was $6.50 worth of food in my box, a full skewer of chicken in hers, and two full drinks. The waitress sees us and weakly explains that she thought we had left already. No offer to even replace our drinks.

Looking back, I know I should've said more, but I was just kind of dumbfounded. We left without saying much more, but come on lady. It's not like we were away for 20 minutes, and it's not like we left the food in our dishes. It was boxed up.

INB4, I realize that eBay can be a crapshoot.

Now on to the story... (mobile format warning)

So my wife and I recently bought Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and realized quickly that the Switch controllers were terrible for playing this game, (IMHO). So we started searching for the Gamecube controller adapter only to find that everywhere had gotten ransacked and there was nowhere local, nor on major retail website. So I go to eBay to see of I can find the old Wii U model which was reported to work with the Switch console as well. Lo and behold, we find a seller who has advertised the exact model we're looking for new with options to include 1-4 gamecube controllers. What luck! And we can pay expedited shipping to have them arrive by the 14th, just in time to celebrate my wife's birthday the following day. Small note that comes into play later, the order was placed on the 9th in the evening.

14th rolls around, no package. No big deal. Holiday season, maybe USPS is running slow.

15th and we're sitting on the couch playing Smash when we see the mail carrier pull up, leave our mail in our mailbox and drive off. No package.

So I get online and check the tracking. The label was made on the 10th, but was not provided to a USPS carrier/facility until the 12th and hasn't left the seller's home state as of the time I checked tracking. I get back on eBay and message the seller and ask for my expedited shipping as they did not deliver the package to USPS in a timely fashion for USPS to at least have enough time to actually try and get it to my state.

The message I get back is:
&gt;Sorry to hear that.
&gt;It seemed there is a holiday shipping peak so that there is a delay happened in your order.
&gt;As you can see in the page, we did send it via USPS priority mail and paid for the cost already.
&gt;In this case, we can issue a half refund of the shipping cost for you as a compensation for the delay, is it ok?
&gt;If you have any other ideas, please feel free to let us know.
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards,
&gt;Seller

I reply back and tell them again that the delay is not on USPS but on them, and they tell me that they ""negotiated with their superior to get me a full refund"". Great fantastic! I get an email within 24 hours that a partial refund has been posted to my account! Hooray! 

It is now the 20th. The package has finally arrived. I open the package and pull out the 3 controllers we ordered and....... no adapter. The entire reason for the purchase. I check the refund that was processed to see it matches exactly with the cost of the adapter on its own. No other refund for the shipping. Of course, I contact them and place a refund request through eBay. I get a rather prompt response with the following:
&gt;Did you receive our previous message about the adapter?
&gt;Here is it:
&gt;""Sorry to tell the adapter you ordered happen to be out of stock now, it seems very hard for us to restore it. We just refunded you so that you can buy from somewhere else in time, and we will also offer you some special discounts for your further order as a compensation.""

&gt;The refund of the adapter was issued to your acc already.
&gt;Did you receive it?
&gt;And may i know do you still want to keep the controller?
&gt;After this problem solved, we will issue the refund of your shipping cost.
&gt;Wait for your reply soon.

But although it was a laid-back afternoon, there was something I needed to say. I tucked my jaw-length hair behind one ear and kept one eye out for our waiter, my other eye on my three-year-old cheerfully eating the last of the ice cream included with his meal. 

A few moments later, a girl came by to take our plates. 

""Excuse me,"" I said, ""is there a manager who could stop by our table?""

She frowned slightly and said she'd go find him for us right away. She scurried off with our plates. Clearly she knew the drill on that request. 

In less than a minute, the manager-on-duty was at our table. His smile was a little too big and his eyes were tired. Like they couldn't keep up with his mouth. Somehow he mustered up enough false energy to say ""Hello! How are you doing today?""

""I'm happy."" I say abruptly, looking him directly in the eye. 

He falters for a moment. The smile stays but his eyes twitch, like he can't comprehend what I just said. 

""Our server Kevin has been great. He's been right on top of things today, and friendly, and he didn't say the words ""ice cream"" out loud in front of my kid when he asked if we were ready for it. We always have good service here but Kevin has been exceptional.""

Another pause. Then, ""thanks it's always good to hear that we're doing well.""

This made my GF quite uncomfortable (she's 17 and he's in his 20's). Later that day at about 10 pm she was sitting by herself in one of the public places on the small island and he approaches her, asks about her stay and then asks for her Facebook so he can add her and they can ""keep in touch"" she just lied and told him she didn't have one because the situation made her uncomfortable. I don't know if I'm just overreacting but I don't think this is acceptable behaviour for staff members of the resort.

933,[deleted],0,t3_a81nu7,9,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a81nu7/chicken_sandwich_for_breakfast/,"This story takes place where the stores mascot would like you to eat more chicken and how I learned you can get chicken sandwich at 930 am from this place. 

It was 930 am and there were people outside taking orders on their tablets (normal for this restaurant) at the drive thru. I pulled up to the worker and asked for two number ones, one with a tea and one with an iced coffee, which at 930 am should be chicken biscuits and hash browns. 

He repeated back to me “two number ones one with a tea and one with a ice coffee” I confirm yep! And I wait in line to get to the window! Finally, I’m at the window about to get my delicious biscuits. Then the worker at the window ask me to pull toward and they’ll bring my food to me. Odd, I thought. I’m just getting chicken biscuits. But sure. So I pull up to a space and wait. For 10 minute while all these cars are going though the drive thru and getting their food while I’m growing more and more confused. Did they just not have chicken biscuits when I pulled up? Out of hashbrowns? Surely out of all these people getting their food one of them also ordered a chicken biscuit or hash browns!

Finally a worker comes out of the building with my food! I’m so excited! They hand me the bag and I look in it and I see fries (which don’t get me wrong are delicious but it’s now 9:45 am...I want hash browns) and I asked the worker 

Me:“why are there  fries...and chicken sandwich’s...not biscuits or hashbrowns?”

Worker:” this is what you ordered”

Me:”I ordered two number ones...which at 9:30 am means biscuits. I wanted chicken biscuit meals”.  I wasn’t rude, I didn’t raise my voice, I was genuinely confused. And this guy just looks at me and shrugs. Doesn’t offer to fix it, doesn’t say anything. Just shrugs at me. 

I suppose I could have asked him to replace it but then I would have had to go in and had them refund the price for the lunch and recharge for breakfast and it just seemed more hassle than it was worth at the time so I just said okay and said I’ll take the sandwiches and fries. But on my way home it bothered me a bit. It’s ok that there had been a misunderstanding but I felt like it should have been handled better so I called and asked to talk to the manger and turns out he was the guy who brought out my food. Our conversation went like

Me: “hi. I came through the drive thru like 20 minutes ago. I ordered two number ones at 9:30 am and got sandwiches and fries and not biscuits and I just want you to be aware so this doesn’t happen to someone else”

Manager: “yes. I brought your food out to you. You ordered two number ones. Chicken sandwiches”

Me: “yes I ordered two number ones. At 9:30 am. For breakfast your number ones are biscuits. Have you started serving lunch earlier than normal?”

Manager: “no. But you said sandwiches. I heard it”

Me: “no I said two number ones. I never said the word sandwich and I’m not sure how you heard it since I didn’t give my order to you. I gave it to another gentleman at the drive through line.   I realize I should have maybe said two biscuit meals instead of just two number ones but I just think in the future the people takes orders should clarify also” 

Manager” I thought it was weird you wanted sandwiches but I’ll keep it in mind. 

And then he hung up. I have never had such bad service at this place! This happened last Friday and it still bothers me a tad. I mean I’ll eat a chicken sandwich at 9 am (because they are delicious, I can’t lie) but then to know this manager was so rude and uncaring just blew me away. It is definitely not the customer service you think of when you think of this place.

I now understand the phrases ""like talking to a brick wall,"" and ""in one ear, out the other.""

Obligatory ""on mobile"" that nobody cares about. 

So about 8 years ago, in the olden days of highschool, I had a terrible teacher that decided she ""wouldn't give out 80 percent or higher"" - a story for another sub. What this meant for all us graduating students is that to meet university admissions requirements we would have to retake the course to get the grade we probably deserved in the first place. 

I ended the course with a 79 (wow thanks), and went searching for a summer course to make up the grade. I'm a research machine so I immediately went looking for all the information ever about doing a summer school course. In my district, there was only the month long course available, intended for people who failed the course. Other districts listed a 2 week upgrade for anyone with a 65 or higher. Score!

Here is the phone conversation I had with the admin assistant in charge of signing up and scheduling students. 

Karen: ""Hello this is (school district) summer course coordinator, Karen. What do you need?""

Me: ""Hi! I'm calling about the 2 week upgrade English course. I have a 79, but need higher for university. I'm from (other district) but saw online that I can go to any district and sign up with my provincial student number. My district doesn't offer the upgrade. I see on your website that (two different schools) are running the course on (these dates).  I know it's a bit late since your district started applications before mine, but is there space available?""

Karen: ""Well we've already started applications.""

Me: ""Yes, my district only just released course offerings so I didn't know I wouldn't be able to do an upgrade until now.""

Karen: ""We've already started applications. Why are you calling so late? You should have applied already through your school.""

Me: ""I'm aware you started. But I'm not from your district.""

Karen:  ""Then you need your provincial number. You can't just sign up through the school.""

Me: ""I know. That's why I'm calling.""

Karen: ""You need 65 or higher to get into the course anyway.""

Me: ""...yes. I told you I have a 79. I just need the upgrade and I saw (these two schools) still had courses available on the website.""

Karen:  ""Well you need your provincial student number to sign up, not just your student card, you'll also need a 65 or above, do you have that too? And I can see that (the schools I have been saying since the call began) have spots. You're lucky.""

Me: ""...Yes. I have everything. I have my provincial number. I have a 65 or over. How do I sign up for either school? Doesn't matter which.""

Karen: ""Well you have to come to the district headquarters to do it. But you need a 65 to be eligible and your provincial number. Do you have that?""

Me: screams internally. 

It went on like that for about 15 minutes. Karen would repeat the same stuff back to me and ignore basically anything I said. I pulled the phone away from my face to stare at it once because I was so thrown off. 

Listen when people talk.

So this happened around 4 months ago. I was about to leave for college and wanted to hang out with my 2 friends before I left. We decided to spend the day at the nearest mall 45 minutes from where we live. When I found out that they had a makeup store I love to shop at, I got so excited. I don’t shop in stores that much anymore, I shop online so it was cool to find these products right in front of me for once. 

When we walk in, an employee stares at us almost immediately. I didn’t think much of it. We walked around the whole store, it took me a while to figure out what I wanted because I was so overwhelmed with all the makeup. I finally grabbed some eyeliner and my friend grabbed some mascara. We continued to shop when I noticed that the same employee that was staring at us when we entered the store was nearby me and loudly said “who would actually steal, there are 9 security cameras.” I don’t know if she was talking to me or talking to someone else nearby so I was able to hear it. When I heard her say that, I was thinking maybe the 2 girls that were asked to leave earlier  because they were under 18 had shoplifted. I didn’t know at the time, but apparently you had to have someone with you who was at least 18 to shop there, but all three of us were over 18 so that wasn’t a problem for us. 

Then a couple of minutes go by and this security guard replaces the area where the employee was just standing at. I notice him but I didn’t think much of it because I thought they wanted to have tighter security after what I had happened with the 2 girls who I thought had shoplifted. Then the security guard walks around the store and goes to the other side where my friends are at and tells them “there was a complaint about someone stealing mascara and I’m giving y’all a chance to fess up and put it back” they had said they didn’t do anything. 

By this time was when I had noticed that the security guard was talking to my friends. They told me what happened and I was confused because my friend did grab  mascara, but she wasn’t done shopping yet, she wasn’t going to leave without paying. We just ended up ignoring him and continued to look around. I noticed that the security guard was looking at us and watching our every move. He came back later and said “Just to let y’all know there are cameras everywhere” that’s when we said that we hadn’t done anything wrong. Everywhere we went he followed. 

By this point I felt really uncomfortable, I was going to buy some foundation but decided not to. I wanted to get the heck out of there. I was reaching for my wallet that was in my bag when I looked up and saw that the security guard was looking straight at me. If the security guard had asked me to search my bag, I would have gladly handed it to him, but we were never asked to do so. In order to walk to the register, I had to walk by the security guard. When I walked by him, I made sure to have my money out. I payed for my eyeliner then my friend payed for her mascara. My other friend who didn’t buy anything was showing off her money to show the security officer that we weren’t there to steal. Btw while this was happening, other people were in the store but he felt the need to only watch us. 

When we left, I honestly wanted to cry. This had never happened to me before, I knew my friends wouldn’t steal anything but I asked them anyway. Of course they told me they didn’t. I decided to call my brother who is a lawyer about what had happened. He was furious. He ended up calling the store and talked to the manager about how customers shouldn’t be treated like that. The manager tried to defend the employee and security officer, but my brother was on the phone until the manager said that he would have a talk with the employees about their policies. 

My brother told me that nothing can be done other than to file a complaint on the employee and the security officer and I told him to do it. That whole experience has traumatized me. I keep thinking was it because of race? My friends and I are Hispanic, the employee looked white and the security guard was black. Then my friends suggested it was because they were lesbians. One of them looks like a guy so maybe they thought why would a guy be shopping for makeup. Idk but I went to a different mall 2 weeks ago that has one of those stores and I decided not to go in because I remembered the experience I had. I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever go back.

 I was with my gf at her place and we wanted some icecream from a company that rhymes with rackwonalds. There is one a few kilometeres  away from her place so i drove there, went inside (drive through seemed pretty busy) and inside there already was a big line of people. No problem ill just wait until i can order. There were 2 employees taking orders at the same time so there were 2 lines forming. I took the right one which turned out to be a big mistake. 

The moment i was on turn to order, the employee who was taking orders on my line had to go to the back to do something else so another employee took his place. I ordered one rackflurry with oreo and caramel for my gf and one rackflurry with cookie dough and no sauce (oreo and cookie dough were special offers they had aside from kitkats and m&amp;ms). Employee makes the oreo caramel rackflurry with no problem and puts it on the counter. 

At that moment i saw a HUGE group of paramedics (20+people) entering the restaurant and taking the left line. They will become important later on. 
The employee asks me what i wanted as the second rackflurry again. I tell him what i want and he just stands there looking at me. A few seconds pass and then he says: „you already got oreo“ i tell him that i know and i want another rackflurry with cookie dough. He doesnt get it again. He then proceeds to ask me if i want my rackflurry with kitkat and i decline again. I explain another time what i want, he still doesnt understand. The game starts again and again and again. He proceeds to ask if i want m&amp;ms, then smarties, then oreo again. I start to get frustrated. I pull my phone out and search for a picture of a cookie dough rackflurry. Thats the point where he understands what i want. Since know now that he isnt really a „fast thinker“ i tell him again that i dont want any chocolate sauce since i dont like it. He nods. At the moment we are about 6-8 minutes in and i just finished my order (thats what i thought). 

I watch him make my rackflurry. He seemed to have forgotten how to make a rackflurry because he puts in double the amount of ice cream which is waaay too much. He also puts about 3 times the amount of sauce you usually put in although i said no sauce. Then he literally puts 3 pieces of cookie dough on top and hands it over to me (without stirring everything like it should be done). I tell him thats not what i wanted at all and i cant transport it like that because the icecream spills over everything. He doesnt get it. Then his colleague sees the abomination and asks him what the fuck he did and that he should put it into the trash. 

The game begins again. He asks me one more time what i wanted again and i just show him the picture of the cookie dough rackflurry and almost scream „NO SAUCE“. this time he seems to get it. Makes my order with cookie doughs and no sauce. We are 20 minutes in now and still its not over. 

He tells me i still have to pay (which i actually do but at rackwonalds you usually pay first and then get your oder but he fucked that up too). He tells me i have to pay around 20€. I stand there in shock and ask him to see the bill, he shows me and it says i ordered around 9 different rackflurries. I tell him the problem and he doesnt understand again. He goes to his colleague again and he looks at the bill and screams at him what an idiot he is and that i only bought 2. The colleague changed the order and i only paid 2. Finally its over ! 

Oh and the 20+ paramedics ? Well after turned around i saw ALL of them already sitting at their table eating a full meal. That means while i waited for 2 rackflurries, 20+ people got
Their full order. The first rackflurry i ordered was completely molten ofc, it stayed there for more than 20 minutes

I never saw that employee again and i was pretty happy about that too.

Tl,dr: ordered 2 rackflurries at rackwonalds, employee fucks up multiple times and the order took more than 20 minutes while 20+ people got their full order

I went to the big box store and was able to get all of my ingredients except for one. I looked up and down the aisles and couldn't find this particular item so I figured this nicer, ""upscale"" grocery store near my home would have it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a little annoyed that I had to another store but figured I could be in and out. I went to the baking aisle, grabbed the one item that I needed and one other thing that I wanted and headed to the checkout. About two minutes standing in line, I felt like I made the wrong choice as there was only one person in front of me and it was taking a long time for the cashier to scan her items because she was just talking so much. Another five minutes passes before the woman is leaving with her cart and the cashier finally scans my things. I see that they are having issues with the card readers so I decide to pay in cash instead, hoping to skip any issues in regards to paying so I can get the groceries that are sitting in my car into my refrigerator faster. 

&amp;#x200B;

The total comes to $7 and some change. I hand her a twenty dollar bill, she turns around and it looks like she is writing something down on a piece of paper (she wasn't using a marker to see if it was real or not, it was a white piece of paper with previous writing on it) I stand there thinking it was a little weird before she moves to the register and presses the buttons to get it to open. She entered that the money I gave her was a $10. I know that's wrong and wait for her to notice her mistake but she doesn't and hands me two dollars with change, she asks me,""Is this amount right?"" I don't want to be rude and I say,""No, I don't think so. I gave you a $20."" and push the money back to her so she can fix it. She looks me in the eyes and asks,""So how much change do I owe you?"" I stare at her, thinking it was a joke. I said flat out,""I don't know. I'm not very good at math."" and she returns,""Me too. Maybe I have a calculator."" she feels around her pockets,""I don't have my phone on me, can you use your calculator and tell me?"" At this point, there are two people in line behind me with a lot of groceries and there are just kind of staring at me so I pull my phone out and give her the correct total. She gives me the correct change this time and I am fully embarrassed at this point. I know I'm not much better than her but part of her job as a cashier is to be able to compute basic math and even if she didn't, she should know how to use the register to figure out the correct amount and not cause me the customer to look fucking stupid. To add insult to injury, the woman was waiting behind me in line says loudly enough for me to hear,""You'd think they be teaching them how to do math in high school.""

942,Drew707,0,t3_a7ikmw,14,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a7ikmw/extra_service/,"When I was 18, I was an idiot.  But I was not a sucker.  


My first car was a 1996 Mitsubishi Montero.  Great truck, albeit anemic.  Some of the things that made this a great truck were its factory off-road features like two lockers, a cool tilt-o-meter, and steel bumpers.  


Me being an idiot, though, decided to run it down to zero brakes.  I mean zero.  Like I was using the e-brake to stop.  One of the most irresponsible things I have ever done.  Realizing how much of a danger this was to myself and others, I decided to take it to a well-known US West tire shop.  


The tire shop was close-ish to my job, so, I roll it in and arrange for a ride to work about two miles away.  When I talk to the service writer, I explain that the truck has absolutely ZERO brakes.  Like, complete system overhaul.  I was expecting pads, rotors, and calipers. The service writer assures me this is no problem and he will call me with an estimate after the inspection.  No problem, and I catch a ride to work.

&amp;#x200B;

About half way through my shift, my phone rings and the service writer identifies himself.  He says the labor should be done before I am off work and he will give me a call.  I agree to the work and price, and let him go.    


A few hours go by, and I get a call from a familiar number.  Expecting it to be the shop telling me the work was done, I answered...  


""Hello?""  
""Drew707?  This is \*service writer\* at \*giant chain\*.""  
""Uh-huh, is the truck done?""  
""Well, we had a bit of an accident.""  
""What do you mean?""  
""Don't worry; all of our staff is fine-""  
""What?!  What happened?!""  
""So, there was a shift change while your car was up on the lift.  The oncoming manager didn't know the situation with the brakes and needed to take it off the lift.  They got in and drove it off, but there was a minor collision.""  
""What do you mean?  What did they hit?""  
""Oh, they hit a tire balancer.  And  brake lathe.  And a work chest.  And a pillar.""  
""WHAT?  How bad is the damage?""  
""Oh, not bad at all.  There is a minor dent, and some coolant leaked out...""  
""Ok, well I am still at work, I will come down there after to deal with this.""  
""Ok, we will be here!""  


Immediately concerned that coolant leaked out (steel bumpers and minor damage?), I call my father and explain the situation.  He is A) pissed that I drove the car under those circumstances, and B) pissed I didn't take it to our family mechanic who was two cities north.  


After work I catch a ride to the shop.  They show me the vehicle which looked like it ate a redwood at 40 MPH.  I asked how fast the driver was going and received a very litigation-safe ""we only go five miles per hour around the shop"".  Clearly this was a bit more than 5 MPH.  I had previously been rear-ended at a much greater speed and the rear bumper showed no signs of impact.    


I understand that things happen when things are getting serviced.  At the time, I worked for a large, now-defunct computer retailer and saw some of the botched jobs the service center had managed.  But, here is where it gets interesting.  


I look at the Montero and it is clear that it cannot be driven.  They had impacted so hard that the turn signal arm had been sheared from the steering column, the radiator was fucked, and the bumper looked like it was force-fed titanium pizza.  Naturally, my next question was how soon they could get me a rental car.  


""Oh, well we cannot authorize a comp'd rental at this time?""  
""Why not?  You guys fucked up my car?""  
""We can't authorize it until our litigation department determines who is at fault?""  
""What do you mean?  You are at fault!  You had my car all day, I was two miles away at work, and you already told me exactly what happened!""  
""Sorry, that is just how it is.""  


At this point, I realize I need a ride home, so, I call dad and explain what is happening.  He agrees to come pick me up.  


While I was waiting, the service writer comes over and hands me an accordion printout and asks me to review and sign.  It is clearly a $450 invoice for services rendered, i.e., the brake job.  


About this time my father shows up.  I show him the vehicle, and then show him the invoice.  Once confronted, the manager just stated that I had signed the service order and they fulfilled it and wouldn't release the vehicle until payment was made in full.   


We left the Montero with them and my father's extremely out-of-character last words were: ""You'll be hearing from my lawyer.""  


Never saw that car again.

Edit: I can't really say what happened next. My father was the owner of the vehicle and was quite pissed off at me (as he should have been). He ended up buying a new car, so I took over his old one. I didn't want to poke the bear about the Montero after what I had done and then what he did for me.

All I know is it was towed to the family mechanic and likely auctioned off. As far as the lawyer talk, never asked. It has been over 10 years; maybe I'll ask now. ",1,Extra Service,25
943,InTheBinIGo,0,t3_a7bifi,23,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/a7bifi/condescending_receptionist_repeatedly_asks_me_can/,"Hopefully this fits in with this sub. I had an awful encounter with a middle-aged receptionist who works at my uni's guidance/counsellor's office. 

I was having a very rough time during my last semester, balancing work, a sad breakup, job hunting, my part-time job and internship. I was really struggling at this time and was ready to give up, but I decided I should go to the guidance office to at least try to make things better. This office is for counseling and is also an academic skills centre (there are people to help check essays, etc.), I went to check an important thesis. 

Anyway, I go into the building, there is a front desk but there's no one there. I see a woman eating her lunch inside, sitting at a table. She's inside (behind the counter) but not actually tending to it. Honestly the set up it a bit awkward because there seems to be two desks in a row. She was in the second one to the front.   
There was a bell and a sign that says ""Please ring if unattended"". I know I should have just said ""Excuse me"" or something but instead I just rang the bell. 

She gets up, looks quite irritated and walks up. She then says, in a very condescending manner, ""Can you read?""   
I'm quite taken aback so I don't say anything. She sighs and asks what I'm here for and I say I'm here to get my paper checked, yada yada. 

I sat down to wait and suddenly she's up next to me (with tupperware and fork full of salad in hand) and points at the sign. ""It says IF UNATTENDED. I was there. Can you read?!"" I am a little awkward with confrontation so I just kind of nod and laugh a bit saying, ""I didn't see you properly.. sorry""   
She's mostly sassy and condescending, rather than actually angry but keeps repeating that she was there and I didn't need to ring the bell. She reads out the sign, asks if I can read over and over, etc. She's also chewing while doing this which just made it even more off-puting. 

I am a very shy Asian girl so maybe she assumed I was an international student (we have many) - if so, it makes it worse that she was mocking me for not being able to read English properly. I am actually a native English speaker  but I can imagine if that happened to someone learning English, their motivation to learn English would be quite shaken. 

When I went into my session to get my paper checked, while the advisor was tearing it apart, my eyes started to water, and we had to take a break. I told them I just had allergies (obvious lie and very awkward). It was honestly from having a shitty time with everything going on and then having some rude lady be sassy to me. 

I did submit a complaint about her though as I remember her full name. I also complained about the desk placement (haha!). They told me they conducted a meeting with her, and said they didn't add details of the complaint so I could remain anonymous, telling her she received a complaint about her behaviour, etc.

So this has basically just happened, apologies for the ranting and the mobile format.


My boyfriend and I were out for an anniversary lunch. We went to a slightly fancy place because it’s a celebration, but somewhere we had been before, so we knew it, and most importantly trusted them. This is because my boyfriend has celiac disease - he was diagnosed years ago, before going gluten free as a fad began. This means zero bread, zero pasta, zero pastry - simple enough to understand right? Apparently not. 


So we went to this place before because they claimed to have contamination-free areas for preparing dishes for those who requested it. They also had specific ‘free’ products, including gluten free bread and pasta. They were as good as their word - my boyfriend had a great meal, and didn’t have any pains or repercussions afterwards, something uncommon for us. It was a no brainer to go here again, and checked online to make sure that there weren’t any bad reviews or red flags about dining with allergies - not a cross word. 


This time was different. We got there in good time, were sat down and ordered drinks, and decided on what we wanted. The menu, as it had done before, clearly stated the gluten free options available - we’d seen online that someone had ordered a gluten free filled pasta, which is something my boyfriend loves. Our initial waitress was as helpful as anything when we asked about it, saying that they did indeed have a filled pasta but served it in a slightly different sauce as the kitchen couldn’t promise that the original sauce was safe from cross contamination. My boyfriend was happy enough with that, and ordered it as his entree (he had a plain salad as his appetizer, which we were also told was gluten free).


Appetizers come and are eaten, we drink wine and shamelessly flirt because why not, and wait for our entree. They both come out promptly, but it’s clear that the sauce served with my boyfriend's pasta is the normal sauce, and not the sauce that the waitress said would come with it. We queried it, and the waitress said that it must have been a mix up with a normal meal placed at the same time that she hadn’t clocked in time - she came back a few minutes later saying that the kitchen had already sent out the gluten free meal, but were making a new dish already and it would be out as soon as possible. She also comped our appetizers, and said she’d see if she could sweet talk the shift manager and get us a free dessert since it was our anniversary since we’d be in there for a little bit longer.


I can only say what I saw, which was the waitress going over to a middle aged woman standing by the bar, talking for a minute, and pointing over in our direction. The next thing we know, the woman has sped over to our table and is asking what kind of scam we’re pulling. We said nothing since we were confused about why she was being so confrontational, and she started going on about how the pasta was definitely gluten free and we had no reason to send it back. My boyfriend started to explain that it was the sauce that was the issue since we were only going on what we were told and apparently it wasn’t safe for celiacs. The manager then started snarling about how she was so fed up with the craze, and that kids like us (we’re in our early 20s, so were probably just arrogant millennials to her) are so sensitive that we need all these labels. The waitress brought over the new dish of pasta at that point, but the manager snatched it from her and started taking it back to the kitchen, saying that the ‘precious table’ couldn't eat anything unless the chef told her that it was all safe to eat.


I really wish we had left then, but the waitress looked so nervous that I felt like we had to stay just so we could tip her well when we finally left. The manager and the food came back a couple of minutes later - she kept a tight hold on the dish asking sarcastically if we felt safe yet, or does she need to drag the head chef away from his job to please us. My boyfriend said that everything was fine and even thanked her for her level of care (he’s the calm and collected one, I was ready to flip) and started eating as quickly as possible, if only to get out of there. I was halfway done with mine anyway, so we just sat and ate until we were both done - I was seething that our anniversary had been ruined so soon by the manager’s attitude, but the worst was still to come. 


We flag down the waitress as soon as we are done and say we want the bill, she says she understands completely and apologises for everything. She's gone for a little while, and comes back as white as a sheet. She says she went into the kitchen to check on another order and saw a pasta dish that looked exactly like the dish my boyfriend had sitting alone on a side. She asked if it was meant to be going out, and she is told that it’s the one that the manager brought back in about 15 minutes ago. The waitress says the manager brought it back out to the customer, but she is told that the manager cornered the chef who was doing the pasta style dishes and told him to drain some normal pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce for a particularly demanding customer who didn’t ‘need’ the gluten free pasta. Guess who just ate a whole dish of gluten? My celiac boyfriend. 


The waitress had comped more or less everything but the wine. I insisted that we paid for all of my dishes, and then gave her a pretty big tip on top - we didn’t know what the deal with comped meals was, but she didn’t deserve to lose out on a table because of her asshole manager. 


To cut out the gruesome bits somewhat, my anniversary afternoon and evening has been and will be spent with my boyfriend shut in the bathroom as things come out of both ends. His stomach has bloated so much that he looks several months pregnant. He will be having repercussions from this for weeks, and maybe even months. I am so annoyed that I daren’t write a review about it since I will end up threatening the manager on a very aggressive, personal level. I want to call anyone and everyone, from my mom to the local news, about this. I keep on bearing in mind that if I go nuclear, and I can, then people like the poor waitress who served us will be out of a job. Until I get my head straight, this is the only place I can rant, so thanks, and well done if you got this far.",1,"You don’t get to decide who is and isn’t allergic to something, period",6083

So in my experience, mechanics often times have a bad reputation for ripping people off. Obviously they're just the bad apples of the group, but they get the most attention. I'd like to share a story of one of the good apples. This happened years ago when my son was still a baby, like under 2 years old. My husband, son, and I live in Central Florida. I decided to take a trip up to visit my parents, who live in Pa. Just my son and I, husband had to work. So we packed up and I drove up over 2 days, a trip I'd done many times in the past, but never as the only adult. The drive up was uneventful, and we had a nice time with my family. 

When the time came to return home, on the first day of driving I made it to South Carolina before deciding to stop for the night. Got going the next morning eager to get home. After driving awhile on I95 I started to notice the smell of gasoline. I brushed it off, thinking I'd dripped some on my hands or something when I'd last filled up. But it didn't go away, and I started to notice, with a sinking feeling in my stomach, that the gas gauge was dropping quicker than it should be.  I was internally panicking, I had no idea what to do. I looked out the rear view mirror and I could see a definite line of something dripping from underneath the minivan. This is when I pulled off at the next exit, having NO idea what to do. I had a cell phone, but this was before smartphones so it wasn't like I could google anything. I just drove down the road, looking for anything where I could possibly get help. It was one of those typical exits on 95, full of fast food, motels, gas stations, etc. It looked like a pretty busy area, so I was hoping I'd find something. 

Fortunately not too far down the road I saw a small auto repair shop. It wasn't a chain store or anything, just a local shop. I pulled in, pretty much on the verge of tears, and took my son, who was getting antsy because I hadn't stopped to eat or anything. I went in the office and I remember that I talked to an older man who happened to be the owner of the shop. I told him what happened, and he said he'd take a look. I'm sitting there shaking, trying to get my son to sit still and eat some snacks. Because now I'm worried that it's something major wrong, and while I had money on me, plenty to get home under regular circumstances, I had no where near enough for car repair. Not to mention worrying that it couldn't be fixed at all.

So after a while, the owner comes back and tells me that some pipe that the gas runs though (sorry I know nothing about cars) is cracked. My heart sinks. Then he tells me that he doesn't even have a replacement, and it would take days to order one. Cue more internal panicking. And a bit of external panicking as I'm trying really hard not to cry. 

Then he says, ""But I can run down to \*whatever store it was\* and get something to patch it up, so you will definitely be able to make it home. I tearfully told him, ""absolutely"" and thanked him. I was still worrying about the money, though. After a bit of waiting, the patch job was finished, and he assured me it would be fine til I got back to FL.

 I nervously asked how much I owed him, getting out my wallet, and he just said, ""Nothing, don't worry about that, just get home safely."" I was a bit in shock and basically thanked him over and over before getting me and the kid into the van and getting back on the road. Even though it was years ago, I still remember that overwhelming feeling of relief and gratitude. I know he must have felt sorry for me, being so pathetic looking, but it was so kind of him to go out of his way to help me, this person he'd never met before, and not even charge me anything. 

I have one regret though, and that is that I was so overwhelmed the whole time, I didn't think to remember the name of the shop, grab a business card, nothing. I wish I could have thanked him again, let him know I got back home with no problems. I don't even remember which exit it was, because they all look so similar. I only remember that it was somewhere around Savannah, Ga.  But, eternal thanks to that repair shop owner, he really saved me that day.

&amp;#x200B;

Happened about a year or so ago. so dialogue not exact

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a local shopping centre. Mostly went there to buy some cat toys for my new kitten, but as the main pet store in the centre opened a little later than most other shops (and since ive got OCD and tend to go places early), i did some other shopping first. After i was done it was still about 10 minutes before the store was meant to open. I had nothing else to do so just decided to wait outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

No problem? right? WRONG  


As im on my phone playing a game (After about 5 minutes of waiting) someone pops out of the pet store to tell me ""We open at 9"". ""No problem"" i say, ""I got here early and dont mind working, take your time"".

&amp;#x200B;

So they close the door and i go back to my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Just standing there quietly as the minutes tick by

&amp;#x200B;

about 10 minutes later (which at this point is a little after 5 past 9) a different person pops their head out. same message though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: We arent open yet

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yes, i can see that, im just waiting

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: We open at 9

&amp;#x200B;

Me: oh thats okay, i dont mind that youre a few minutes late

&amp;#x200B;

Lady (angrily this time): WE. OPEN. AT. 9!  


Me: yes and its now 8 minutes past 9 (show her the time on my phone), its okay im in no hurry, please take your time.

&amp;#x200B;

Lady: YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT SIR I DONT APPRECIATE YOUR ATTITUDE!!! WE OPEN AT 9!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I am being patient, all ive done is stand out here and play a game on my phone, take your time opening im in no rush

&amp;#x200B;

Lady slams the door shut.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point i figure its better to take my business elsewhere

No idea why they were so stressed, all i was doing was standing there playing [paper.io](https://paper.io).

My boys came running to the bathroom to tell me my bathwater was draining into the kitchen. After getting out and doing some investigating i discovered the overflow drain was not attached to any pipe. When I took the plate off i could see the light defuser over the kitchen light from the hole in the tub.  The landlord was a nice man from my church who was giving me an awesome deal on the rent and i didn't want to rock the boat. So no baths for me. I replaced the useless drain cover and then taped plastic over it and we just took showers. Then a few months later the tub drain clogged so we had to ask the landlord to call a plumber. In comes this guy. An older guy who unclogged the drain, turns out a small child of the previous tenants had let a plastic necklass go down the drain and it collected enough to stop the water. The guy lectured me about not letting my kids have toys in the tub. I explained that i had boys and this was a little girls toy and not ours. He just shook his head and smiled. Then when i asked him if he could fix the overflow drain he took off the plate himself. The pipe was clearly not attached and you could see down into the kitchen. He said it was fine and replaced the cover. I watched him. He didn't attach anything and this guy, i kid you not, gave me that same stupid smile and told me, ""You're a woman. You just don't understand how plumbing works."" So i asked him, completely incredulous, ""So the tub is supposed to drain into the kitchen?"" He refused to believe me. I called the  landlord after guy left and told him what happened. Landlord fired that guy and a new guy came the next week and actually fixed the drain.

As the boys came in I blocked my 3 70lb dogs (two Huskies and a Shepherd mix) from rushing the door to check out the stranger. I turned around to find him on my top step with both the screen door and security door wide open. It looked like he intended to step inside. Um, no.

I stepped right up to the threshold and pulled the door shut behind me as much as I could. It was still wide enough for a dog to get through, and he didn't step back even though I was very much in his space.

I had planned to step outside and shut the door to listen to him, but suddenly I wanted the metal screen door shut between us. I had to lean into him to grab the screen and I said, ""Excuse me please, I need to shut the door.""

He didn't move until I actually touched him with the screen, and in that moment it didn't matter what he was selling, I wasn't buying it from him. He did step back and I shut the screen and he launched into his script.

Selling security systems. Go figure.

""I'm not interested, have a wonderful day.""

What the actual fuck was that? What, if anything, do I need to do now? You can't just walk into people's houses even if they don't have dogs. Did he think the boys invited him in? (They said they'd get me.) Was it a pushy salesman technique? Foot in the door?  Even a step down from me he was taller than I am.  Not ok.

I walk the dogs after school, and it would be a good way to calm down, so we got ready to go. Perhaps we'd run into Mr. Salesman and I could say something.

We did.

I said, ""Hey. I was trying to shut the door before they got out."" Then all 4 of us rounded the bush on the corner and he could see them. It's quite a lot of dog coming at you all at once, and though we were still about 15 feet away, his eyes widened and he took a step backwards. 

""...Oh.""

*Highly* satisfying.

Then he told me how gorgeous they are and asked where to get a dog like that.

I told him they're all rescues and to check the dog pound.

Hello all you happy Reddit people! This story took place a number of years ago when my small town was shunted into the 21st century with the addition of a DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNN SUPER BIG BLUE STORE!!

Cue gasps of shock and awe that almost mask the distant sobs of despair...

After many years of quiet innocence our town was introduced to the ultimate representative of American consumerism.

THE SUPER BIG BLUE!

That vast urban oasis of frivolity where one can be guaranteed to find anything you could ever dream of owning. Now our Big Blue, we are told, is not like any other Big Blue in Canada. Oh no! It is the size of two and a half football fields and is the crowning achievement of 2 years of construction and spans the border of our town and the next rendering it impossible to tell which of us can claim this monstrosity as our own! And so when you entered this self-contained urban hive you saw before you, 3ft tall letters proudly proclaiming Welcome to the Town/Town Big Blue!

If that weren't enough to fill any spirit with a sense of impending doom, a friendly greeter with a thousand watt smile will be ever eager to jump out at the unsuspecting innocents and shout WELCOME TO BIG BLUE! while slapping a bright yellow smiley face sticker on the end of your nose!

Now I, like everyone else in our town was keen to experience this wonder of retail so I put on my fancy socks and sallied forth to the town border where the brick monolith greeted me with a neon glow and the scent of floor polish and new tires.

As I stood in the entrance, with my smiley sticker leering up at me, I surveyed the endless kilometres of aisles before me and began to feel the first twinges of fear. This did not have the feeling of a night that was going to go well at all, however, I bravely took hold of my supersized shopping cart and set forth to join the masses of happy Big Blue shoppers!.

The most amazing thing about any Big Blue in any country of the world, is that they are able to find the most cheerfully, perky people on the face of the planet to work for them! It is my firm belief that if the government were to somehow harness the sheer wattage of the required Big Blue smile, we would be able to light up our entire city for a year! Do not let those cheesy grins fool you, however, for indeed they hide brains that know NOTHING about the place in which they work!

The first item on my list was shoelaces. Simple! Thought I. YOU FOOL! Shouted the gods of all things that are Big Blue and laughed as they mocked my innocence! Off I trotted to the shoe department to be met with a rack containing no less than 20 different shoelace styles, types and various shades of brown, dark brown, nearly black, almost black, not quite black , and oh yes! Black!

As I stood in stupefied amazement, a helpful friendly employee in a bright blue vest came zipping by, obviously turbo charged by his required 15 minutes of Big Blue Workout! ""HALT!"" shouted I!. The poor boy stopped so suddenly his soft soled shoes made the noise of tires screeching to a stop!

""Which shoe laces are right for my shoes,"" I asked, while still staring at the rack in confusion. ""Shoes?"" Asked the lad. ""Shoes?"" He then dropped down the floor and stared at my shoes while poking them gently with a finger. ""Shoes!"" and smiled up at me with the look of a puppy expecting a treat. ""Shoelaces!"" He beamed and zipped off again! I stood there scratching my head and coughing from the dust he created from his roadrunner like dash, and finally selected a black - or are they nearly black? - shoelace package and continued on my way.

My next stop was greeting cards. I hesitantly waved down a nearby sales girl , ""Excuse me do you know where the birthday cards are?"" The girls smile faded to a mere 950 watts as she stared at me in great confusion. ""Cards?"" she mumbled, and slowly tuned in circles. Finally she scratched her head, and wiped her nose on the back of her hand and pointed vaguely off down the aisle. ""That way!"" she beamed and zipped off leaving me choking in another cloud of dust.

6 employees, and 2 Xanax later, I finally finished my journey into the 7th level of Hades and began to navigate my way out of the store. This is not an easy task! Oh no! For indeed they do not want you to leave! They want you to stay until you are a wrinkled, hopeless, mummified corpse of humanity curled up in the corner of the ladies fitting room, mumbling something about attention Big Blue shoppers!

But leave I did and as I reached the doors, the greeter smiled her thousand watt smile and said ""thank you for coming to Big Blue do come again!"" I looked at her and began to tremble while some where deep inside me a cry began and soon forced is way out of my mouth while i screamed ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"" and made a frantic dash to the parking lot and freedom!

and with this thought, i leave you with the warning. When a Big Blue greeter beams at you and says ""Welcome to Big Blue!"" run! Run the other way! and DONT LOOK BACK!",1,When the Big Blue store moves into the 21st century - or how I almost got sucked into the void of no return!,2

Boy if you ever want to set random people off, say ""black"" and ""face"" together, apparently. Holy shmoley, you'd think I said the N word in public.

Some lady, who happens to be holding the leash of a black Labrador Retriever, gives a massive gasp, and does the pearl-clutching gesture, before starting in with something along the lines of:

Unfortunately our breaks are only 20 minutes long so if we order out it has to be delivered or else one of us is basically out of their break.

I called and asked what the total had to be for delivery and she scoffed and told me $25 I let it pass and started telling her my order. Each time I finished an individual order(paying all together but needed to know after tax what each meal was and I understand it's annoying but it's a necessary evil when ordering at the work place) she would heavy sigh and huff and puff. 

She informed me that they were out of the pulled chicken for the chicken tacos. I skipped over that order and motioned for that co worker to pick something else off the menu. I end up getting through everyone else's order before she picked something else as she was **really** looking forward to those tacos, they're the only reason we picked there for lunch.

I informed the woman that it would be just a second and that I was sorry and she said, ""okay, where are you located?"" I tell her the grocery store on x street and with the most attitude I've ever heard over the phone she states, ""you mean the one that's walking distance? You want me to deliver to 5 minutes away??"" I said yes please and that other co worker would like wings.

I really wanted to throw attitude at her face, but this lady was going to be handling our food and I didn't want to risk that she'd do something to it. I debated telling her never mind we'd figure something else out but then it hit me.

This bitch was going to be bringing us our food. I got everyone's share. Her tip? One. Single. Cent.

Do I normally agree with this? No. I'm all about tipping wait staff at least 20% and delivery at least $5, even if it's just down the road, or more depending on how far they travel and what the total was.

I debated on no tip at all, but I feel like one penny was enough of a smack in the face. Either that or she assumed we got the total wrong and gave no tip. Either way we won't be ordering there again and I don't know if I'll go in there with friends or family. This isn't the first time they've been rude for no good reason.

Edit: Perhaps I should have clarified, this place only delivers to businesses, it's someone in the back, not even wait staff, who handles the phone calls and deliveries.",1,Uncalled for rudeness and judgement,4

So I went to a sandwich shop I frequent in my city. The name is also a name of a form of transportation. I know the manager there pretty well because a family member used to work there so I got to know them during that time. 

Anyway I got in to pick up my online order and saw a homeless man walk in before me. Thought maybe he was going to use the restroom or just get out of the rain as it's coming down pretty hard today. 

He went up and said something to the manager, not sure what as I couldn't hear him. But I did hear the manager say she would whip him up a sandwich. Which is what she did. 

She made him a sandwich, gave him a bag of chips and a drink. All for free. I was near tears from how amazing this woman is. She has always been a very friendly person but this just showed me how big her heart truly is.

Now I don't know what exactly was wrong with everyone on Sunday (May 5th) but every customer that walked in was just plain, rude. If I said every bad tale, I'd be here for a good hour or so. 

So during this day, I had a line of people asking for the same thing over and over again. Eventually it got down to where we had no more fruit salad. So this gentleman comes in, asking for said side. When we explained we were out, he was muttering under his breath: ""What do you mean you have no fruit salad. You can't mix up the strawberries, oranges and blueberries RIGHT THERE?""

Now again, remember that this is a cafeteria styled restaurant. Those toppings are for parfaits and other salads. So, being as polite as I could be I closed my eyes and said: ""Sir, if you'd LIKE me to I can get you the strawberries, blueberries and oranges and mix them up as a fruit salad for you."" Stunned, he stares at me realizing I heard him. He then stated: ""Oh wow, you'd do that for me?"" And I just smiled, handing him the fruit.

Well come the day I'm off, me and my room mate go out to eat at a different restaurant. Complaining about how rude the customers all seemed to be on Sunday. Mind you we both work the same work schedule, so this is just a basic routine we do when we're off. Helps get off the bad week and start a new, you know?

Well as I was explaining the story about the fruit salad man. Apparently his son, was sitting just a few booths down from us and had walked over, standing intimidatingly at us and screamed: ""THAT'S MY DAD!""   
We paused, stared at each other and then looked at him laughing. I asked if he was joking and he just, continued to stare down at me like he was about to murder me. Irritated and bewildered, he slowly sits back down and we just eat our meal. I'm trying to brush this off, though I'm clearly pissed. 

But it doesn't end there. The woman who was with him, decided to be the one next in line to come up and ask for my name. I stared at her like she was a moron, because again remember.. We are off the clock. We are NOT working. She doesn't have a right to hear my name, nor do I even know this person. My room mate lied and said a fake name to throw her off, which she then proceeded to say: ""I want you to know that speaking ill of others is very unprofessional and that I'll be talking to corporate. I hope that nobody ever speaks bad about you.""

Beyond stunned, sitting there and staring as this stupid woman walks off... I finally decide to go to my work. Which was ironically, right down the road from where we were eating so that we could warn the managers of this stupidity. These two customers decided they weren't done and the moment I left, ganged up on my room mate. 

Luckily for me, my friend doesn't back down and she bit back at them. Bluntly explaining that they should be embarrassed to go out of their way and make us feel bad. When we're clearly on our day off, just trying to relax.

We shouldn't feel threatened outside of our job. I had warned the manager of these two and we put our foot down that if  they even try and get something out of this, we will not be happy. That was straight up harassment. Needless to say, I'm calling the cops next time I see them.

I live in a fairly small town. Approximately 35K people (give or take) Other than a couple of drug stores, hardware stores and a dollarama the only place to shop for Christmas is big blue. Land of the smiley face where the employees are all dead inside and wondering where their lives went so horribly wrong.

Now this event took place a number of years ago when big blue still had layaway in Canada. One bright October day, I decided to head on over to big blue to do some advance Christmas shopping and put it on layaway. 

So I put on some clean underpants and a t-shirt that actually fit (GASP!) and sallied forth into the bright fall sunshine!. I got to big blue and happily started to peruse the shelves, adding more and more gifts to my steadily growing heap in my shopping cart. 

Decorations! Toys, Clothes, things that sparkled , whirled and made music! All jumbled together in a chaotic pile of Christmas glory! I stared at my pile of loot and patted the top of it gently before heading over to the deep, dark bowels of big blues layaway department.

I stepped through the door and looked around, the one fluorescent light flickered dismally in the ceiling lending a sad, glow to the broken counter and dispirited workers below. Old posters hung on the walls advertising long forgotten movies and the famous sign sagged pathetically on the counter. ..elcome to ...al mart...

I gulped, this did not bode well for me but hey! Christmas! So I skipped over to the counter and began shifting my pile of goodies. 25 minutes later i skipped out the door with my layaway receipt in my pocket, contemplating coffee and maybe a cookie!

Fast forward 1 month. I had gone in each week to make my payments, carefully kept my receipts and now I was ready to pick up my horde! I skipped into big blue while humming Christmas carols to myself, grabbed a cart and danced down the aisle to the layaway desk.

I am here to pick up my goodies, said I. 

Clue blank look from the clerk. You have a layaway? 

Me - (puzzled..that was why i was there...) um, yes? (handed her my receipts

Clerk - snuffles and rubs her nose. We dont have that here.

Me - (confused) of course you do! see! receipts! do please look again!

clerk - nope

Me - (becoming alarmed) what do you mean no! I spent over $150 on this!

clerk - (calling over her co worker) she claims she has a layaway here but we dont have it.

Clerk 2 - (looks at me like i am senile) are you sure you laid it away in THIS store dear? we all look the same you know.

Me - 1. This is my receipt which clearly says THIS STORE. 2. Do not ever call me dear! 3. I am in full possession of my faculties and 4. YOUR MANAGER NOW! (yep i went Karen on em!)

Manager - whats up?

Me - explaining everything while trying to maintain my temper.

The waitress first comes up and asks for drink orders, normal stuff and she seemed really nice at first, everything is going well. 
She comes back for food orders and says in a condescending tone ""Do you need some more time?"" Because I had a hard time figuring out what drink I wanted and it took a while, I had started to get annoyed.

I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip pancake combo (chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips inside, chocolate drizzle, chocolate chips on top and whipped cream, and the usual combo stuff like eggs and sausage) I was hella excited bc it was a new item and it looked so good. 

Later she comes and brings bare pancakes and the combo, and tells me ""I figured you wouldn't want the stuff on top"" I say ""Actually I would, I wanted what was advertised, please"" trying not to sound rude or anything, because I wasn't trying to have someone spit in my food. She pushes the pancakes towards me with a smirk, and just walks away, I never got the toppings as she didn't even come to the table the rest of the time, only to pick up our empty plates and give me the receipt.

I was PISSED, the whole time I wasn't even really mad that I didn't get the toppings, I'm not really the type of person to get mad if my order is messed up in any way, I was more mad about the fact that she assumed for some reason that I wouldn't want what I ordered. 

When I later paid for the food, I wrote ""0%"" on the gratuity thing (basically the tip line) and she had the nerve to say ""Why didn't I get a tip?"", I explained to her that she didn't even give me what I wanted, and she never even walked to our table after that (usually as a waitress/waiter, they'd walk to the table, ask if we need refills, ask if everything is going good, etc. It's been like that at every single place I've been to that has wait staff, and the previous times I've been to this restaurant). I wanted to ask for the manager, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of things on my boyfriend's birthday, and like I said I'm not one to make a big deal out of my order being messed up, it's open 24 hours, the cooks are probably tired, I get it y'know. I probably should've asked for the manager though, now that I think about it oof. 

Not really a crazy story and kinda anticlimactic, but it really pissed me off and I wanted to be able to share this with someone

Edit: I do usually tip, even if the service isn't 100% great I still leave at least something, and this was by far the worst service I've gotten. Much worse could've happened but it's still no excuse for treating customers like that.

Another edit: I did check that the toppings weren't just add-ons, rather than just coming with the pancakes themselves, they were supposed to come with, unless you asked for extra. And yes I was billed for all of it, although I'm not sure if removing the toppings would've changed the price in any way. 
And thank you everyone for the tips ! I'm not usually one for confrontation so I actually have no idea how to go about this, so you've all been really helpful 💗",1,BiHob Adventures,377
960,ToxyRocker,0,t3_bljskq,3,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bljskq/another_happy_tale/,"About two years ago i ordered a t-shirt from overseas. I live in Sweden and the order was sent from the US.

The t-shirt was around 40 bucks plus around $15 for shipping.

At the time here in Sweden our postal service usually didn't bother charging you VAT/TAX on stuff you orderd outside the EU.

That time i got unlucky and had to pay it. First of all i had to pay a fee witch was about 15 bucks. Then i had to pay the VAT/TAX for the item itself which was around $10.

So that t-shirt got really expensive, total spent 80 bucks.

(Nowadays we have to pay VAT/TAX for every single thing arriving from outside the EU (even if it costs 1 cent) since the customs gave the postal service a hard time for not collecting it.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the happy part.

After getting the t-shirt i was super happy with it. Super soft and excellent quality.

I messaged the company to tell them how pleased i was about it and also casually mentioned that i had to pay customs for it and that i didnt mind it.

I expected them to be happy i bought a t-shirt and maybe ask for a pic.

They got upset about me having to pay customs for it. They ended up giving me $15 partial refound and another $15 as a coupon code for my next purchase.

I didn't expect that so i thanked them deeply.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last week.

Browsing a social media site i happend to scroll past a post from this company and decided to see it they had anything i liked. I ended up ordering a tanktop and at the checkout i remembered the coupon code i got 2 years erlier. I had to check the conversation to see what the code was and it still worked!

I was surprised it was still active. It made my day and i sent them some love.",1,Another happy tale,261

Love this subreddit and this is my first ever post, so please be gentle. Seen a whole load of apologies for posting on mobiles re. formatting. Personally haven't seen any difference, either on mobiles or computer, but will point out that I'm on my tablet, so apologies for any formatting problems.

A few weeks ago, I broke my watch. My own fault. Not a mega-expensive one, but pretty nice, and it was a birthday present from my wife a few years ago, so didn't want to discard it. The metal strap had come loose from the watch face.

Happened to be at our local hypermarket in south-east London. In the car park, there's a small cabin belonging to a national chain which specialises in watch repair and key cutting, so I decide to see if I can get it fixed. Turns out that one small part is broken. The man behind the counter replaces the part and fixes my watch. Takes about three minutes. I figure this will cost me up to £10, which I'm perfectly willing to pay.

With the fixed watch now on my wrist, I ask him how much. He says ""well, the part cost next to nothing, so just put something in the charity box"". My jaw nearly dropped to the floor (for the record, I put £8 in).

About a week later, I read that this national chain makes a big effort to employ ex-prisoners, to help them with rehabilitation. I have no idea whether this man belongs to this category or not (frankly it's none of my business), but my experience there, coupled with the company's efforts to help society, mean that they will be getting my business in the future.

I'm generally quite negative about humanity in general, so thought I'd report something that gave me a warm glow (pretty sure that said glow is not due to the male menopause). Thank you so much, Watch Repair Man!",1,Faith in humanity restored (at least temporarily),769

This happened on a Sunday so I wasn't expecting a reply any time soon, however I received a reply about 20 minutes later, from the owner/creator no less. She was extremely polite and let me know she'd have it looked at to be fixed.

If it had ended there I would have been completely satisfied, but she emailed back a bit later to let me know she had found the error (rounding error caused the issue) and that it would be fixed asap, she even offered to help me sort out the grocery list to fix it.

963,TheNamelessOnesWife,0,t3_bl20ql,105,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bl20ql/grocery_store_trip_cashier_and_manager_wont_let/,"This happened several years ago and still bothers me to this day. I never tell this story IRL but felt like getting it out into the world somewhere. This is my first post to this subreddit and it is a very negative filled post.


For context this was my first trip to a discount grocery chain store. This store had special rules for payment and did not accept credit cards at the time I decided to try shopping there. I looked online to check if my bank debit card would be accepted, it was listed so I thought I was good to go.


Arriving I did not know I had to put in a quarter for a cart. I put in my quarter then picked up a dozen or so items.


At the checkout line the cashier asks me if I have a bag. I did not. She tells me I need to buy a bag and points to a shelf. I don't want to hold things up, I should have done more research, my own fault for not knowing about the quarter charge for carts and about bringing your own grocery bag, but from here on things go straight to shit.


The bag shelf is almost empty, I need to get on my knees and reach to get a bag crinkled at the back of the very bottom shelf. I hit my head on the middle shelf trying to get the bag and knocked the empty shelf off.


There is a pair of people behind me in line who start laughing, ridiculously loud laughing, but I don't react to them. The cashier tells me I'm holding up the line, and tells me to hurry up. No one asks me if I am okay. The cashier stays behind the register expecting me to fix the shelf. I reattach the shelf quickly (to my surprise) and hand over the bag for cashier to scan. I loathe being emotional in front of strangers so I'm doing my best to have no reaction even though I can feel how red my face is.


The total is on the till so I pull out my bank card to pay by debit. The cashier puts out her hand in a stop motion and tells me to use the debit machine to get cash. The pair of people behind me roar in laughter again calling me stupid to each other. I'm counting myself lucky neither of them is pulling out a phone to film whatever they think is so damn funny.


Me: I checked online before I came in. This store accepts my debit card. I want to use my debit card.


Cashier: No. That's a credit card you're holding and we don't take credit.


Me: It says debit card right here. The back of the card has this symbols...and they match the banner (I point to banner hanging by checkout that states payment rules). So I want to use my card.


Cashier: We don't take credit cards. That is obviously a credit card. You are holding up the line.


The laughing pair of people behind me chime in between laughs with their own comments. Saying I'm stupid and I need to follow the rules.


Cashier: See, everyone else knows how this works.


At this point some sort of manager walks up and asks what the problem is.


Cashier: This woman is refusing to pay for her groceries. She has a credit card.


Me: I have my debit card right here. It's not a credit card. I just want to pay but she won't let me.


Cashier: I told you to use the cash machine.


Manager: Yes that's right. For your convenience we have a cash machine located in the store. Do you know your pin number?


I feel like I'm losing my mind, I'm sure I'm still red faced but I don't show emotion in my voice and keep my body language neutral. I'm determined to explain this only one more time and then I'm leaving. That is what I thought…


Me: Why would I pay a fee to pull out cash when I have my debit card that you accept? I have a debit card. If this was a credit card I couldn't pull out cash. Please let me use my card in your machine, the cashier has not let me use my debit card to prove that it works.


I hold the card out in my hand. The cashier puts up her stop hand and the manager keeps his hands at his side. Crazy pair roar out in laughter again.


The Manager and Cashier start repeating their dialogue alleging I have a credit card and I need to get cash from the ATM but I shake my head no.


Me: No. I'm not buying anything, I'll put all this back. (I put my hand on the cart handle which has the groceries in it)


Manager grabs the cart: No, you haven't paid! You are not allowed to take these!


Me, I let go of cart first then say: Uhh...what...I want to put the stuff away so I can get my quarter back. 


Crazy pair pointing and continuing to laugh at me echoes through the store.


Manager: You need to pay for these groceries before you can return the cart miss.


Me: Uh...please let me put everything back so I can get my quarter, I don't want to give your store any of my money now please.


Manager still holding cart: Only paying customers can put away shopping carts. I will not responsible for you taking these items because you can't or won't pay.


At that statement from the manager, hearing crazy pair continue to laugh when they could have just gone to another line, and all the damn looks other people were giving me I simply left. I walked out. Ignoring the Manager and then the Cashier saying something out at me, I try ignoring the laughing pair as scream something about me running away and I am an idiot. I'm MAD as hell that the bastards in that store got a quarter of my money because they would not let me put away things and then return the shopping cart. I wanted nothing of mine to contribute to that store financially so people like the laughing pair could continue to shop there. Now maybe it was policy that things could not be restocked by the customer, but every item was in one bag. The manager or cashier could have taken out the one bag and let me put the cart away. I didn't think of that in the moment.


Once I got to my car I drove not too far to an isolated parking lot and finally freaked out letting out all the crying and rage I held back in the store.


I almost certainly was acting like an emotionless robot with a red face after I hit my head hard on a shelf and being subjected to the constant laughter from the two crazy people behind me in line. I can be socially awkward but I did not deserve to be treated like I was by the employees. Telling me I have a credit card when I don't, while also telling me to use my alleged credit card to pull out cash from my bank from the ATM when that isn't how it works. Refusing to let me get my quarter back from the cart return. The employees treating me as the problem when the pair of people were the ones making a scene.


I have no idea what the laughing pair of people were all about. If they weren't there maybe I could have resolved everything. The worst thing about the whole experience was them. The Cashier seemed unphased by their laughing and was more concerned about those two getting their full cart of groceries scanned and paid for. Logically I know they must have annoyed the Cashier and they are why a Manager came over so quickly. They were two plain regular looking folks seemingly on a normal grocery trip. But the laughing, pointing, insults, and how they would not stop after seeing me hit my head. It would be one thing if they had laughed, then asked if I was okay and offer to help, that would have been acceptable. But all they did was laugh. That's why I would never shop there again, discount prices attracting true assholes who don't care about anyone except themselves.


I'd like to completely forgot about that store but it has become increasingly popular in the area I live. I regularly hear from people how I should go shopping at discount grocery store and it's the best. I tell people I don't like the store and will not ever shop there. Most people don't push the issue, if they do I just say I have my reasons and refuse to explain while changing the subject. 


At the time I went back online to check again if my bank debit card was listed and it was. As a customer I've only been treated badly and unfairly twice, this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had as a customer. It seemed like because I only had a few items to purchase I was placed at a lower value then the laughing pair behind me who had a full cart. The employees were against me, as if they held me responsible for the actions of the pair behind me as I was the object of their crazy laughing abuse.",1,"Grocery store trip, Cashier and Manager won't let me pay, 2 other customers make it even worse",516
964,TheVsArt-andStuff,0,t3_blkdlv,4,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/blkdlv/my_history_with_bats/,"When I was about 2-3 years old, there was a bat in my house. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember all the details, however, I myself remember hiding under my dad's computer desk, with my older sister. I also remember having to get rabie shots, the bat had given me, my sister, and both my parents rabies. Not much else on that. ( We moved out of that house 4-5 years later, and never told the people that had bought it what happened with the bat. That isn't important to my story, it is just important to me that people know that.) 

Fast forward years later, in Christmas of 2017. I remember much more than the first experience, so buckle up. Down to exactly time it was. (I checked my phone constantly.)

It was 10:11 and me and my fam were playing 5 second rule in our hotel room. I was getting super tired and dizzy, after a long day of opening gifts, talking with relatives, ect. I got into my new unicorn onesie that I had got that morning. (My mom washed it before our trip, and I think to the day I die, I will love unicorns.) I dozed off pretty quickly.

I was waken up at 11:38, to my sister shaking me awake. My mom was running around, having a panic attack, my dad, trying to calm her down. What followed went like this:

Cast-

V- me

M-mom

D-dad

S-sister

F1- front desk lady1

F2- front desk lady2


V: S, what the heck is wrong with you? What time is it?
S(quietly): V, I don't want you to freak out, but there is a BAT in mom in dad's room! 

I felt a whirl of confusion and fear race through my brain.

V: A what?

My sister gathers up some of her things, and I gather some of mine, (my tablet, phone, my pillow, some chocolate I had received earlier, and my glasses) as my mom and dad put leashes on my dogs. One of them was hyper and wanted to go outside and run around. The other dog, was a little shizu, old, and could care less if the building were on fire.

With experience with a bat, my parents put a towel under their door to trap the bat in the room. We went down to the lobby, where 2 young female employees were whispering to each other, and stopped when we approached.

F1: Um, hello... how can we help you?
D: We need a new room. Now.
F2: Why? Oh goodness, is it a mouse?

I'm trying to keep myself from laughing...

M: Oh hell naw, ITS A F***ING BAT. 

It was at that moment, I had never known the human jaw could drop so low until that moment.

F1: I'm sorry, a what?
M: You heard me, there's a bat in our hotel room.
F2: Can we get you a new room?
D: That would be great.

Apparently, instead off calling animal controll, one of the ladies at the desk had called the police. They showed up with animal controll half an hour after we got a new room. Wise cops. 

We got that stay and our next 2 stays at that hotel for free. I honestly couldn't blame the hotel, because they were doing massive renovations, so we were probably lucky it wasn't a Snake or something. When the bat was tested for rabies, we got a message saying it didn't have any. There's where this would've had this be a prorevenge story, because the hotel would've had to pay for our rabie shots. 

We didn't stop going to the hotel after that, as it was an accident, and the gave out free breakfast in the mornings, and popcorn all day. It also allowed dogs. 

I had to post this story because recently, the stubborn shizu died. His name was Joe, and we loved him. I am not taking it too well, and especially my sister. I'm trying to get over it, but it's really hard. Any support people give on this post is welcomed and noticed. 

Also, if r/ the youtuber sees this, I love your videos, and my other dog is named Cosmo, he is a Portugese water dog as well!

I had been craving mapo tofu for over a week so after driving to a place my colleague had recommended that had already closed for the evening we decided to go to a random little place google maps told us mentioned mapo tofu on their menu.

We got there at about 35ish min before they close. I really didnt want to bother them but I figured that might be enough time to not be a pain. No one was there other than us and I believe an employee eating dinner. A waitress greated us and seated us with menus immediatly, and brought out some tea and water too. she came back shortly after to take our order. (oh and I wont type it but the waitress had a very heavy acent and there was a definite language barrier)

SO= significant otter 

W= waitress

*at this point I see the mapo tofu in the veggie section of the menu*

Me internally: *Oh, thats a weird place to put a pork and tofu dish... maybe they're thinking the tofu counts it as a veggie? Weird.*

SO: *orders his sweet and sour chicken after some questions*

Me to Waitress(W): ""Hey, the mapo tofu, thats the tofu in the red sauce with ground pork, right?""

W: ""Oh, no, no pork, just veggie and tofu""

Me: *insert look of my brain hitting a wall at 100mph*

W: ""You... need more time? Maybe you'd like -*lists every pork or spicy dish I was not at all listening to as I desperatly glanced over the menu*-?

At this point I basically just resigned myself to not eating anything. I figured we already took up a table so I'd order SOs food to go and just tip on it.

M: ""Oh, uhhhhh, no... no, its okay. We'll, uh, we'll just go with what he ordered and, uh, you can probably do that to go and, uh, nothing for me... thanks.""

W: ""You sure? Ok then, Ill bring some hot and sour soup while waiting, no charge on bill.""

SO looks at me apologetically as I put my hands on my temples framing my eyes as I mutter-groan softly (I thought) to him after she was well out of earshot (I thought), ""Man, I just wanted mapo tofu. My gps said they had it and everything and Ive been wanting this for weeks.""

Apparently I'm not as quiet as I thought

W dead stops about 15' away from table and comes back 

W: ""You know what, we chop pork from shredded pork dish and put in tofu. You still want? We'll make it good!""

Me, stunned af: ""Uh, yeah, ok, thank you!"" 

W walked off as SO and I just stared at each other at how sweet of an offer to special order that for us so close to close time. About 5min later she brought out our soup (which I ate all of because so is picky) and about 10 min after that she brings us out these HUGE portions of food. Seriously, we currently have at least 5 meals worth of leftovers in the fridge. 
It gets better: When it came time to pay the bill she brought boxes for our food unprompted, got us fresh scoops of rice to go because she didn't want to send us home with spoiled rice, and also gave us a freeking QUART of the soup because we seemed to like it. At this point SO and I are trading awkward glances like 'holy shit, she did NOT have to do any of this, wtf shes so nice'. 


So I did what any completely sane person would do. I tipped $20 on a $19 order. She gave us a to-go menu so we could look it over if we ever wanted to try anything else in the future and saw us out before going to pick up the tip. As we were leaving she came hurrying out of the restaurant (we parked directly in front of it) to thank us profusely over the tip which I just super awkwardly brushed off like 'oh, yes, no problem, thanks for the service'. Super freeking awkward on my end because as someone with mostly NY heritage who works customer service, I just expect some impersonal level of casual, normal rudeness. Seriously, people thanking and going out of their way like this for me bothers me inherently; I have a problem, send help.

I was posting more as both a rant, and a warning, regarding my experience. I'm hoping that others benefit, as I know that most people don't understand some of their rights while in a hospital. People just accept what they are told, and may actually end up in worse situations due to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently posted here, about changing my primary doctor, due to my diabetic condition. As a brief recap, I went to see my primary doctor about my very high (200-400+) blood sugar readings. I had gone specifically to request that she change my medication, to ones that were more reliable and better suited to my uncontrolled state. I was really concerned, because nothing that I was doing was working, and my sugars had been getting worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of changing my medication to older, more reliable ones, she decided to add newer medications, including some that weren't covered by my insurance. Not thrilled with this, I ended up going to the local ER, so that I could see if they could help determine what was wrong. They decided that my readings were within reasonable limits (my blood sugar tested as around 200 at the time), and that there weren't any signs of bone infections (I am very prone to them, having had 4 at the time). Because of this, I got sent back home, and just told to get wound care, and see my primary doctor for more care.

&amp;#x200B;

My home health nurse got me a wound care doctor that would visit me at home, and I went ahead and arranged to see a new primary care doctor the next week (would have been last Wednesday). The new wound care doctor would see me that Monday (a week ago last Monday), after I got through with the ER the Friday before (So two weeks ago last Friday). However, that Sunday, I realized that I must have hit my foot against something, and had a massive blood blister (turned out I had two, actually), and my foot wasn't looking nice. However, since I had already gone to the ER, and was seeing a wound care doctor the next day, I didn't go back to the ER right away.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I ended up seeing the wound care doctor, and my home health nurse, that Monday. Neither liked the look of the blisters, but decided to let them try going down on their own. The wound care doctor removed excess skin from my original foot wound, and patched me up nice and clean, leaving some extra padding to allow the blisters extra cushion. It wasn't enough. Apparently at least one of them busted that night, and soaked, and I do mean SOAKED, the padding and cover that they had put on my foot.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up taking a shower the next morning (Tuesday), and putting a light dressing on my foot (which looked really horrible, all bruised, various colors, swollen, just nasty), and waiting for the home health nurse to show up. An hour later, my dressing was soaked, and he had arrived. He thought the discharge was from the night before, not realizing that I had just put the new dressing on less than an hour before. But when he realized that, he took pictures to send to the wound care doctor. Between them, and my boyfriend, and yes, me too, we all decided that my history with bone infections meant that I needed to see the ER again.

&amp;#x200B;

This time, they admitted me. My blood sugars indicated a massive infection (yes, this became bone infection number 5), and the x-rays and other tests showed that I needed IV antibiotics yet again. I spent 8 days at the hospital, with each and EVERY single day having fasting sugars of 375+ (I think there was only one fasting that was 375, the others were 400+). I had to have two surgeries, one to remove part of the ball of my foot, and the second one to help clean up the area and then close up the entire surgery site.

&amp;#x200B;

The miscommunication issues I had were enourmous. First, the hospital doctor wouldn't even think of putting me on enough insulin to try controlling my sugars. At home, I was using at least 25 units fast acting, 45 long acting. It was only toward the end of my week that they started giving me 18 units fast, and 22 units long (twice a day halfway through the week). This didn't stem my readings, I was still seeing, according to my discharge paperwork, an average blood sugar reading of 330 daily. Admitted, this is with the infection, but I never saw any normal blood sugar readings, not even once, during the entire 8 days I was there.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only was I having problems with them not aggressively treating my sugars, they weren't telling me what changes they were putting into effect, or why. I was on a diabetic diet, which was actually very generous. You were allowed to select from a restaurant style menu (you had a list of various grill items, salads, desserts, drinks, etc, like with a normal restaurant. Not like the standard hospital menu of two options and you were stuck). But I'd be allowed to select a salad and chicken strips, with dressings for both. Then, randomly, I was told that I couldn't have dressings for both. No rhythm or reason given, just nope, what you ordered for lunch today, and dinner yesterday, well, it's not allowed for dinner today. Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the menu choices I had. But I generally chose the same things for lunch and dinner (large salad with dressing, chicken strips and dressing, two diet cokes, and maybe a jello or something small as a changeup), and would get frustrated when I would sometimes randomly be told that I couldn't order two dressings, or something else wasn't allowed for some unknown reason.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, there was my pain management medication. Because I have a high pain tolerance, it would take a fairly large dose of pain medication to actually have an actual effect. I'm talking about, something like 20-30MG of percaset or oxy to really control pain. But the hospitals never liked to believe me, and would usually maximize my dosage at 10MG every four hours, three if I was really lucky. So honestly, I never got real pain management, and it honestly never bothered me  that much when they would reduce or remove the pills, or IV injections. It just meant that I was right back at where I started with, controlling my pain through just plain ignoring it when possible. But I had an amputation. Not really fun, but actually not that painful. I guess the neuropathy was working in my favor, reducting the pain to background noise, which I was used to. However, they chose to try to use the pain pills to force me to wear the oxygen nose things when my blood oxygen wasn't at ideal levels. They tried threatening to cancel my pain pills if I didn't stick these little plastic tubes into my nostrils to force extra oxygen into my system. They didn't like it when I laughed and told them to keep the pills. I wasn't going to wear the tubes because I didn't like them, and my oxygen levels were good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

They ended up telling me several different reasons why various staff didn't think I was discharged as rapidly as I could have. Blood oxygen wasn't ideal (94% wasn't good enough?). My blood sugars were too high, which I wholeheartedly agreed with. Should have been consistently 180 or lower, and I was still seeing 400 as my fasting number. Home health wasn't set up. Umm, no, my home health agency was fully aware that I was going to use them, and they were aware of my history and everything. My prescriptions weren't set up. Umm, well, I got a small pain pill script, a ""push"" IV med, and an antibiotic 10day supply, none of which were actually given to me upon discharge. I had to go fill them, and of coarse some had a co-pay. If I hadn't been able to beg a little money off a very generous relative, I wouldn't have been able to fill the antibiotic. Oh, and turned out, my water was shut off the day before I went home, so I had to immediately call the water company and find out what I needed to do in order to have house water, as a disabled resident. Basically, there wasn't a single true reason for me to be delayed on my discharge, except for the blood sugars, which I still don't have under control, days later.

TLDR: Well, I ended up going to the ER, and due to really screwed up miscommunication and other issues, I think I can honestly get a lawyer interested in suing the hospital. I went in with wildly uncontrolled diabetes, a massive infection which ended up costing me part of my foot, and left missing the portion of my foot and STILL with wildly uncontrolled diabetes. Because the infection can be directly linked to the blood sugar readings that were/are very high (I mean, go to ER, don't pass GO, levels), I think that the hospital can be considered negligent in not aggressively treating my blood sugars while I was there. I ended up going over a LOT of details from my 8 day stay at the hospital, and I think it might be interesting for anyone who has a diabetic family member, or is diabetic themselves, to read over. I wouldn't want anyone to end up going through the same situation I went through, especially if it's not needed.",1,"Went to the ER and was admitted, but I think I'm going to be seeing if I can sue the hospital",13
968,Hexual_Innuendo,0,t3_bko1v1,22,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bko1v1/pizza_not_pizza/," Living  in a city in Denmark I pretty much have a pizza place on every corner, I  can pick and choose from many places  and a huge variety in their  quality of Pizzas. In Denmark there are only a few major pizza chains and only one have seen fit to set up shop in the city I'm in and they closed recently due to a big scandal, so I've frequented a local privately run place near  me which has decent pizzas and more importantly decent salads and  sandwiches as I sometimes buy my lunch from there.

One  day a friend had invited me to concert with his family and him. They  had ordered food from another place for themselves, but because they  weren't sure about my dietary restrictions, we agreed that I just get my  own dinner and because I'm a creature of habit I just went to the pizza  place and ordered a chicken salad.

When  the salad was done, I paid for it, said thanks and was about to leave  when the owner asked me if I wanted a sandwich and at first I was like  huh? He then explained that he had made a sandwich for himself but for  some reason had put bacon on it, which he couldn't eat, so he wanted to  give it to me no charge and because I'm dumb and had dietary  restrictions at first I said no but then he insisted and in the end I  caved and got a free sandwich out of it, so yay!",1,"Pizza, not pizza",306

So I went out on a snack run I got a slurpee and some chips and the guy in front of me just paid for my stuff. I didn't know even know who he was but thanks random guy",1,Thanks random guy,47
970,rooty27k,0,t3_bkv8j0,6,/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/bkv8j0/meat_filled_desserts/,"So my wife (vegetarian) and went out to celebrate my birthday last night. As we had done something during the day we decided to go to a restaurant near the event. Turned up and everything was great. Managed to change tables so that wife could have a wall behind her to help her deafness. Perused the menu and noted the 5 or 6 vegetarian options that wife could have as starters or mains. Ordered some breads and oils, along with our starters and our mains. Breads and oils arrived at the same time as our starters. Don’t know if that is common but think normally it comes whilst starters are being prepared. 
My main was great. Steak cooked to perfection. Wife’s main was supposed to be garlic and mushroom risotto. This tasted so bland. No garlic and a slight hint of mushroom. The rice tasted like long grain rice. So she sent the dish back and she decided to skip this course and have dessert. 
When we get the dessert menu we um and ah over the eight choices for a few mins then decide. We then noticed there was no (v) next to the desserts listed. So checked with host and she stated that none of the options were vegetarian and they had a fruit salad or sorbet. 
So the chocolate fondant, creme brûlée, pear Eton mess, or the salted chocolate torte, or the cheese and biscuits, or the others I cannot remember all have meat in them! 
Host was not able to suggest another option so we skipped dessert and got bill and headed home. 
How do you get to make that many desserts non vegetarian. I get that gelatine might be in a creme brûlée but really???",1,Meat filled desserts,12
